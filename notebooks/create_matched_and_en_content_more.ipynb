The school's primary campus is located in Hyde Park, New York, with branch campuses in St. Helena and Napa, California, San Antonio, Texas, and Singapore. The college, which was the first to teach culinary arts in the United States, offers associate, bachelor's, and master's degrees, and has the largest staff of American Culinary Federation Certified Master Chefs. The CIA also offers continuing education for professionals in the hospitality industry as well as conferences and consulting services. The college additionally offers recreational classes for non-professionals. The college operates student-run restaurants on their four U.S. campuses.\n",
      "The school was founded in 1946 in New Haven, Connecticut, as a vocational institute for returning veterans of World War II. With a growing student body, the school purchased a former Jesuit novitiate in Hyde Park in 1970, which remains its central campus. The school began awarding associate degrees in 1971, bachelor's degrees in 1993, and master's degrees in 2018. Additional campuses were opened in the following years: St. Helena in 1995, Texas in 2008, Singapore in 2010, and Napa in 2016.\n",

      "The New Haven Restaurant Institute was founded on May 22, 1946 in New Haven, Connecticut as a vocational training school for returning World War II veterans.  It was organized by the New Haven Restaurant Association, who positioned Frances Roth and Katharine Angell to lead and develop the school. It was the first culinary college in the United States. With assistance from Yale University, the school purchased the Davies mansion in New Haven's Prospect Hill neighborhood. The first class consisted of sixteen students and the faculty included a dietitian, a baker, and a chef. In 1947 the school was renamed the Restaurant Institute of Connecticut to reflect its growing repute; the school's name was changed again to the Culinary Institute of America in 1951.Enrollment grew to approximately 1,000 students by 1969, beyond the capacity of its original campus, so the school purchased the St. Andrew-on-Hudson Jesuit novitiate in Hyde Park, New York in 1970. In 1971, the college began awarding associate degrees, and opened its doors in Hyde Park in the following year. From 1974 to 1979, the school built three residence halls, a culinary library, a career planning center, and a learning resources center. From 1982 to 1984, the American Bounty and Caterina de' Medici Restaurants and St. Andrew's Café opened. In 1984, the school's continuing education center (later named the J. Willard Marriott Education Center) opened, and the school improved its teaching kitchens and constructed an experimental kitchen and food laboratory. In 1990, the school opened a baking and pastry facility, named two years later as the Shunsuke Takaki School of Baking and Pastry. In 1993, the school opened its Conrad N. Hilton Library and began offering bachelor's degree programs. In 1995, the school's first branch campus opened, the Culinary Institute of America at Greystone in St. Helena, California. In 1998, the Student Recreation Center was opened.\n",
      "The Apple Pie Bakery Café opened in 2000, and the Colavita Center opened the following year. More residence halls were built at the school's Hyde Park campus in 2004. In 2005, Anton Plaza opened in Hyde Park while the Ventura Center for Menu Research and Development opened in St. Helena. The school's third campus opened in 2008 in San Antonio. Two years later, the CIA opened a campus in Singapore consisting of a facility on the campus of Temasek Polytechnic. In 2012, the CIA began offering a bachelor's degree program in culinary science, and in 2014 introduced a bachelor's degree in applied food studies. In 2015, the college expanded its recreation center and added a new dining facility for students, called The Egg; both are housed in the CIA's Student Commons building. In the same year, the college acquired a portion of Copia, a museum in downtown Napa, California that operated from 2001 to 2008. In 2016, the college opened a campus, the Culinary Institute of America at Copia, which houses the CIA's new Food Business School. The college, which was outgrowing its St. Helena campus, purchased the northern portion of the Copia property for $12.5 million. In 2018, the CIA launched a Bachelor of Science degree program in Hospitality Management and introduced master's-level education with a Master of Professional Studies degree program in Food Business. In 2019, the college began offering a Master of Professional Studies degree program in Wine Management.\n",

The average need-based loan was $3,825, and the average loan debt per graduate was $51,200. 88% of graduates were offered full-time employment within six months, with an average starting salary of $33,754 per year. Average earnings from on-campus employment were $2,355; the school offers federal and other work study accommodations.\n",

      "mise en place is the college's newsletter for alumni. The newsletter aims to improve the relationship between the school and its alumni by providing information of interest about the college, its alumni, and students; covering of major issues and events concerning the college; and featuring the leadership and contributions of the school's alumni.La Papillote, the school's student newspaper, was established in 1979. The newspaper's stated purpose is to report the news of the institution to the students and other members of the campus community. The newspaper also examines contemporary issues of the industry and other topics. The school's student life department oversees production of the newspaper and fills its editor-in-chief position, which is held by a current student. The paper uses submissions from students, chefs, and outside professionals.\n",

      "The CIA has a brand licensing program that sells branded products for foodservice operations and households, and it also publishes cookbooks for professional and home use. The school's general cookbook, The Professional Chef also has an interactive iPad edition that PC Magazine called \"a new frontier for books.\" During the late 1990s, the CIA produced the PBS television show Cooking Secrets of the CIA.\n",

      "Beginning in April 2007, the school hosts the CIA Leadership Awards event annually to honor people for success and achievements in the foodservice industry. The events are organized as fundraising dinners, with CEOs and other prominent members of the industry attending, sponsoring student scholarships. At the Leadership Awards event, the school issues the Augie Award, named for Auguste Escoffier, the French chef and restaurateur who popularized and modernized French cuisine. In 2017, Shep Gordon, Jacques Pépin, and Martha Stewart were each recipients of the award.In 2017, the CIA began hosting its Thomas Keller Golf Classic, a golf outing and fundraiser for student scholarships. The school hosted the inaugural event on June 17 at Silverado Resort and the school's Copia campus in Napa County, near Keller's restaurant the French Laundry.\n",

      "== Criticism ==\n",
      "\n",
      "On April 23, 2008, amid complaints directed toward CIA president Tim Ryan, the school's teachers' union approved a vote of no confidence, with a vote of 85 to 9. The faculty described poor equipment, falling academic standards, and little support in the administration for complaints as causes. The largest complaints, laid out in a thirteen-item list, included outdated technology, poorly-designed uniforms, poor-quality classes and dining hall meals, excessive tuition, students admitted with no chance of succeeding, substandard school-brand kitchen equipment, overcrowded classes and residence halls, complicated schedules, and poor record-keeping. The document described President Ryan as taking an autocratic style, ignoring staff input, and retaliating against criticism. Ryan later met with union representatives and described coming improvements in scheduling and curriculum. Immediately after the faculty's vote of no confidence, the board of trustees unanimously voted to their confidence and support of Ryan and extended his contract.Following the approval, students began organizing a protest, including creating several student groups on Facebook, and hanging \"Fire Tim Ryan\" signs in dorm rooms. The students described further complaints including the administration's close ties with the corporate food industry and less challenging kitchen tasks, such as frying frozen waffle fries. In May the school prevented the campus newspaper, La Papillote, from writing about the issue, which prompted its editor to resign. The school later apologized and reportedly allowed a full report in the paper's next issue. Ryan held that he was trying to prevent students from being involved in a conflict between the faculty and administration.On April 23, 2013, about 90 students held a walkout and protest in objection to a recent trend of declining enforcement of educational standards. The policy, requiring applicants to have professional kitchen experience, has varied from three months to a year, and is currently six months; a 2011 revision allowed front-of-house service to count for the requirement. The protesting students signed letters to teachers and the school administration, gave speeches, and donned name tags with their student loan debt written on them.On September 27, 2015, the Culinary Craft Association (CCA), a union at the school, protested the CIA's outsourcing of jobs. Previously in 2015, the school had terminated 40 jobs in its dishwashing, stewarding, and cleaning departments, forcing them to reapply for jobs with cut wages and benefits. Later that year, CCA joined the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 200United, members of which also protested in September 2015. The school was also demanding CCA cut ties with SEIU in order for the union workers to keep their jobs. On September 22, 2017, CCA held another protest; 17 of the 45 workers represented in the union are scheduled to be laid off and replaced by workers of LCS Facility Group. The workers are in grounds-keeping, recycling and painting at the school, where most of them have been employed for at least 20 years.In November 2017, soon after the Weinstein effect began and because of it, The Washington Post reported on a student who criticized the school's handling of sexual assault. She was the victim of an attempted rape on the CIA's campus. The victim and attacker were scheduled to work together at an on-campus restaurant soon after the attack, and after the victim's complaint, she nevertheless had to work with him that subsequent weekend. After they were scheduled together again, she quit working there. At the same time, one of the school's deans informed her the school dismissed her complaint as the attack did not violate the school's harassment, sexual misconduct and discrimination policy. The victim said that the school also mentioned that because the victim escaped, no violation occurred.\n",

      "Common marshmallows are also molecular foods, and the molecules of sucrose crystals have a very neat arrangement. Once entering the cotton candy production machine, the heat of the heating chamber that is high in the machine center temperature will break the alignment of the crystal, so that the crystal is turned into syrup. In the heating chamber, there are some holes having a small size than particles, and when the sugar is rotated at a high speed in the heating chamber, the centrifugal force is sprayed from the small hole to the surroundings. Since the liquid substance is associated with a cold solidification and its surface area, the larger the surface area is, the faster the solidification is. Therefore, the syrup injected from the small hole is solid into a sugar, and it is not adhesive. That is, the organizational structure between ingredients is changed, and then recombined.\n",

       "'Molecular gastronomy is the scientific approach of nutrition from the perspective of physics and chemistry. The physical properties: force, vector, and mass; and chemical components: molecular structure, formulae, and reactant products of an ingredient are addressed and utilized in the preparation and appreciation of the ingested products. The field differs from the amalgamation of ingredients and application of heat used by early hominids to produce sustenance as a way to acquire nutrients to promote health. It is the constituent of food science that approaches the preparation and enjoyment of nutrition from the perspective of a scientist at the scale of atoms, molecules, and chemicals.\\nNicholas Kurti, Hungarian physicist, and Hervé This, at the INRA in France, coined \"Molecular and Physical Gastronomy\" in 1988. While there are those who label others\\' work as gastronomy, there is a population of chefs who identify as autonomous individuals in their field as chefs.\\n\\n\\n== Examples ==\\n\\n\\n=== Eponymous recipes ===\\nNew dishes named after famous scientists include:\\nGibbs – infusing vanilla pods in egg white with sugar, adding olive oil and then microwave cooking. Named after physicist Josiah Willard Gibbs (1839–1903).\\nVauquelin – using orange juice or cranberry juice with added sugar when whipping eggs to increase the viscosity and to stabilize the foam, and then microwave cooking. Named after Nicolas Vauquelin (1763–1829), one of Lavoisier\\'s teachers.\\nBaumé – soaking a whole egg for a month in alcohol to create a coagulated egg. Named after the French chemist Antoine Baumé (1728–1804).\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nThere are many branches of food science that study different aspects of food, such as safety, microbiology, preservation, chemistry, engineering and physics. Until the advent of molecular gastronomy, there was no branch dedicated to studying the chemical processes of cooking in the home and in restaurants. Food science has primarily been concerned with industrial food production and, while the disciplines may overlap, they are considered separate areas of investigation.\\nThe creation of the discipline of molecular gastronomy was intended to bring together what had previously been fragmented and isolated investigations into the chemical and physical processes of cooking into an organized discipline within food science, to address what the other disciplines within food science either do not cover, or cover in a manner intended for scientists rather than cooks.\\nThe term \"molecular and physical gastronomy\" was coined in 1988 by Hungarian physicist Nicholas Kurti and French physical chemist Hervé This. In 1992, it became the title for a set of workshops held in Erice, Italy (originally titled \"Science and Gastronomy\") that brought together scientists and professional cooks for discussions about the science behind traditional cooking preparations. Eventually, the shortened term \"molecular gastronomy\" became the name of the approach, based on exploring the science behind traditional cooking methods.Kurti and This considered the creation of a formal discipline around the subjects discussed in the meetings. After Kurti\\'s death in 1998, the name of the Erice workshops were changed by This to \"The International Workshop on Molecular Gastronomy \\'N. Kurti\\'\". This remained the sole director of the subsequent workshops from 1999, and continued his research in the field of molecular gastronomy at the Inra-AgroParisTech International Centre for Molecular Gastronomy, remaining in charge of organizing the international meetings.\\n\\n\\n=== Precursors ===\\nThe idea of using techniques developed in chemistry to study food is not a new one, for instance the discipline of food science has existed for many years. Kurti and This acknowledged this fact and though they decided that a new, organized and specific discipline should be created within food science that investigated the processes in regular cooking (as food science was primarily concerned with the nutritional properties of food and developing methods to process food on an industrial scale), there are several notable examples throughout history of investigations into the science of everyday cooking recorded as far as back to 18th century.\\n\\n\\n==== Marie-Antoine Carême (1784–1833) ====\\nThe concept of molecular gastronomy was perhaps presaged by Marie-Antoine Carême, one of the most famous French chefs, who said in the early 19th century that when making a food stock \"the broth must come to a boil very slowly, otherwise the albumin coagulates, hardens; the water, not having time to penetrate the meat, prevents the gelatinous part of the osmazome from detaching itself.\"\\n\\n\\n==== Evelyn G. Halliday and Isabel T. Noble ====\\nIn 1943 the University of Chicago Press published a book titled Food Chemistry and Cookery by the then University of Chicago Associate Professor of Home Economics Evelyn G. Halliday and University of Minnesota Associate Professor of Home Economics Isabel T. Noble. In the foreword of the 346-page book, the authors state that, \"The main purpose of this book is to give an understanding of the chemical principles upon which good practices in food preparation and preservation are based.\"The book includes chapters such as \"The Chemistry of Milk\", \"The Chemistry of Baking Powders and Their Use in Baking\", \"The Chemistry of Vegetable Cookery\" and \"Determination of Hydrogen Ion Concentration\" and contains numerous illustrations of lab experiments including a Distillation Apparatus for Vegetable Samples and a Pipette for Determining the Relative Viscosity of Pectin Solutions. The professors had previously published The Hows and Whys of Cooking in 1928.\\n\\n\\n==== Belle Lowe ====\\nIn 1932, Belle Lowe, then the professor of Food and Nutrition at Iowa State College, published a book titled Experimental Cookery: From The Chemical And Physical Standpoint which became a standard textbook for home economics courses across the United States. The book is an exhaustively researched look into the science of everyday cooking referencing hundreds of sources and including many experiments. At a length of over 600 pages with section titles such as \"The Relation Of Cookery To Colloidal Chemistry\", \"Coagulation Of Proteins\", \"The Factors Affecting The Viscosity Of Cream And Ice Cream\", \"Syneresis\", \"Hydrolysis Of Collagen\" and \"Changes In Cooked Meat And The Cooking Of Meat\", the volume rivals or exceeds the scope of many other books on the subject, at a much earlier date.\\n\\n\\n==== Elizabeth Cawdry Thomas ====\\nThough rarely credited, the origins of the Erice workshops (originally entitled \"Science and Gastronomy\") can be traced back to cooking teacher Elizabeth Cawdry Thomas, who studied at Le Cordon Bleu in London and ran a cooking school in Berkeley, California. The one-time wife of a physicist, Thomas had many friends in the scientific community and an interest in the science of cooking. In 1988, while attending a meeting at the Ettore Majorana Center for Scientific Culture in Erice, Thomas had a conversation with Professor Ugo Valdrè of the University of Bologna, who agreed with her that the science of cooking was an undervalued subject, and encouraged Kurti to organize a workshop at the Ettore Majorana Center. However nothing happened until Kurti met Hervé This: both approached the director of the Ettore Majorana center, physicist Antonino Zichichi, who liked the idea. They invited the food science writer Harold McGee to join them as invited co-director of the first workshops in 1992.\\n\\n\\n=== Nicholas Kurti ===\\nUniversity of Oxford physicist Nicholas Kurti advocated applying scientific knowledge to culinary problems. He was one of the first television cooks in the UK, hosting a black-and-white television show in 1969 entitled The Physicist in the Kitchen, where he demonstrated techniques such as using a syringe to inject hot mince pies with brandy in order to avoid disturbing the crust. That same year, he held a presentation for the Royal Society of London (also entitled \"The Physicist in the Kitchen\") in which he stated:\\nI think it is a sad reflection on our civilization that while we can and do measure the temperature in the atmosphere of Venus we do not know what goes on inside our soufflés.\\nKurti demonstrated making meringue in a vacuum chamber, the cooking of sausages by connecting them across a car battery, the digestion of protein by fresh pineapple juice, and a reverse baked alaska—hot inside, cold outside—cooked in a microwave oven. Kurti was also an advocate of low temperature cooking, repeating 18th century experiments by British scientist Benjamin Thompson by leaving a 2 kg (4.4 lb) lamb joint in an oven at 80 °C (176 °F). After 8.5 hours, both the inside and outside temperature of the lamb joint were around 75 °C (167 °F), and the meat was tender and juicy.With his wife, Giana Kurti, Nicholas Kurti edited an anthology on food and science by fellows and foreign members of the Royal Society.\\n\\n\\n=== Hervé This ===\\nHervé This started collecting \"culinary precisions\" (old kitchen wives\\' tales and cooking tricks) the 24th of March 1980, and started testing these precisions to see which held up; his collection eventually numbered some 25,000. In 1995, he received a PhD in Physical Chemistry of Materials, for which he wrote his thesis on \"La gastronomie moléculaire et physique\" (molecular and physical gastronomy). He served as an adviser to the French minister of education, lectured internationally, and was invited to join the lab of Nobel-winning molecular chemist Jean-Marie Lehn. This has published several books in French, four of which have been translated into English, including Molecular Gastronomy: Exploring the Science of Flavor, Kitchen Mysteries: Revealing the Science of Cooking, Cooking: The Quintessential Art, and Building a Meal: From Molecular Gastronomy to Culinary Constructivism.\\nHe currently publishes a series of essays in French, and hosts free monthly seminars on molecular gastronomy at the INRA in France. He gives free and public seminars on molecular gastronomy every month, and annually gives a public and free course on molecular gastronomy. Hervé This also authors a website and a pair of blogs on the subject in French, and publishes monthly collaborations with French chef Pierre Gagnaire on Gagnaire\\'s website.\\n\\n\\n== Objectives ==\\nThe objectives of molecular gastronomy, as defined by Hervé This, are seeking for the mechanisms of culinary transformations and processes (from a chemical and physical point of view) in three areas:\\nthe social phenomena linked to culinary activity\\nthe artistic component of culinary activity\\nthe technical component of culinary activityThe original fundamental objectives of molecular gastronomy were defined by This in his doctoral dissertation as:\\nInvestigating culinary and gastronomical proverbs, sayings and old wives\\' tales\\nExploring existing recipes\\nIntroducing new tools, ingredients and methods into the kitchen\\nInventing new dishes\\nUsing molecular gastronomy to help the general public understand the contribution of science to societyHervé This later recognized points 3, 4, and 5 as being not entirely scientific endeavors (more application of technology and educational), and has revised the list.\\n\\n\\n=== Areas of investigation ===\\nPrime topics for study include\\nHow ingredients are changed by different cooking methods\\nHow all the senses play their own roles in our appreciation of food\\nThe mechanisms of aroma release and the perception of taste and flavor\\nHow and why we evolved our particular taste and flavor sense organs and our general food likes and dislikes\\nHow cooking methods affect the eventual flavor and texture of food ingredients\\nHow new cooking methods might produce improved results of texture and flavor\\nHow our brains interpret the signals from all our senses to tell us the \"flavor\" of food\\nHow our enjoyment of food is affected by other influences, our environment, our mood, how it is presented, who prepares it, etc.\\n\\n\\n== Chefs ==\\n\\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, the term started to be used to describe a new style of cooking in which some chefs began to explore new possibilities in the kitchen by embracing science, research, technological advances in equipment and various natural gums and hydrocolloids produced by the commercial food processing industry. It has since been used to describe the food and cooking of a number of famous chefs, though many of them do not accept the term as a description of their style of cooking.Chefs who are often associated with molecular gastronomy because of their embrace of science include Heston Blumenthal, Grant Achatz, Ferran Adrià, Rikku Ó’Donnchü, José Andrés, Sat Bains, Richard Blais, Marcel Vigneron, Sean Brock, Homaro Cantu, Michael Carlson, Wylie Dufresne, Pierre Gagnaire, Adam Melonas, Kevin Sousa, and Laurent Gras.Despite their central role in the popularisation of science-based cuisine, both Adria and Blumenthal have expressed their frustration with the common mis-classification of their food and cooking as \"molecular gastronomy\", On 10 December 2006 Blumenthal and Harold McGee published a \\'Statement on the \"New Cookery\" in the Observer in order to summarise what they saw as the central tenets of modern cuisine.  Ferran Adria of El Bulli and Thomas Keller of the French Laundry and Per Se signed up to this and together released a joint statement in 2006 clarifying their approach to cooking, stating that the term \"molecular gastronomy\" was coined in 1992 for a single workshop that did not influence them, and that the term does not describe any style of cooking.In February 2011, Nathan Myhrvold published the Modernist Cuisine, which led many chefs to further classify molecular gastronomy versus modernist cuisine. Myhrvold believes that his cooking style should not be called molecular gastronomy.\\n\\n\\n== Techniques, tools and ingredients ==\\nCarbon dioxide source, for adding bubbles and making foams\\nFoams can also be made with an immersion blender\\nLiquid nitrogen, for flash freezing and shattering\\nIce cream maker, often used to make unusual flavors, including savory\\nAnti-griddle, for cooling and freezing\\nThermal immersion circulator for sous-vide (low temperature cooking)\\nFood dehydrator\\nCentrifuge\\nMaltodextrin – can turn a high-fat liquid into a powder\\nSugar substitutes\\nEnzymes\\nLecithin – an emulsifier and non-stick agent\\nHydrocolloids such as starch, gelatin, pectin and natural gums – used as thickening agents, gelling agents, emulsifying agents and stabilizers, sometimes needed for foams\\nTransglutaminase – a protein binder, called meat glue\\nSpherification – a caviar-like effect\\nSyringe, for injecting unexpected fillings\\nEdible paper made from soybeans and potato starch, for use with edible fruit inks and an inkjet printer\\nAromatic accompaniment: gases trapped in a bag, a serving device, or the food itself; an aromatic substance presented as a garnish  or creative serveware; or a smell produced by burning\\nPresentation style is often whimsical or avant-garde, and may include unusual serviceware\\nUnusual flavor combinations (food pairings) are favored, such as combining savory and sweet\\nUsing ultrasound to achieve more precise cooking times\\n\\n\\n== Alternative names and related pursuits ==\\nThe term molecular gastronomy was originally intended to refer only to the scientific investigation of cooking, though it has been adopted by a number of people and applied to cooking itself or to describe a style of cuisine.\\n\\nOther names for the style of cuisine practiced by these chefs include:\\n\\nAvant-garde cuisine\\nCulinary constructivism\\nCocina de vanguardia – term used by Ferran Adrià\\nEmotional cuisine\\nExperimental cuisine\\nForward-thinking movement – term used at Grant Achatz\\'s Alinea\\nKitchen science\\nModern cuisine\\nModernist cuisine, which shares its name with a cookbook by Nathan Myhrvold, and which is endorsed by Ferran Adrià of El Bulli and David Chang\\nMolecular cuisine\\nMolecular cooking\\nNew cuisine\\nNew cookery\\nNueva cocina\\nProgressive cuisine\\nTechno-emotional cuisine—term preferred by elBulli research and development chef Ferran Adrià\\nTechnologically forward cuisine\\nVanguard cuisine\\nTechno-cuisineNo singular name has ever been applied in consensus, and the term \"molecular gastronomy\" continues to be used often as a blanket term to refer to any and all of these things—particularly in the media. Ferran Adrià hates the term \"molecular gastronomy\" and prefers \\'deconstructivist\\' to describe his style of cooking.

      "The electronic computer (also known as computer) is a device that utilizes digital electronic technologies to indicate and automatically perform any arithmetic or logical operation sequence according to a series of instructions. General Computers have enabled them to perform extremely wide tasks due to the ability to follow the general operation set known as \"program\".\n",
      "Computers are used as a control system for various industrial and consumer equipment. This includes simple specific use devices such as microwave ovens and remote controls, industrial equipment (such as industrial robots and computer aided designs), and mobile devices such as personal computers and smartphones). Although there is a wide variety of computers, according to the diagram of the theory, a computer with basic functions should be able to complete what other computers can do. Therefore, it is theoretically from smartphones to supercomputers to complete the same job (regardless of time and storage factors). Due to the rapid advancement of technology, the next-generation computer always can significantly exceed its previous generation, this phenomenon is sometimes referred to as \"Moore Law\". Through the Internet, the computer is connected to each other, which greatly improves the speed of information exchange, which in turn has promoted the development of technology. In the 21st century, the computer's application has been involved in side, and all walks of life.\n",
      "Since ancient times, simple manual equipment - as abacus - help people calculate. In the early days of the industrial revolution, the appearance of a variety of machinery is to automatically complete the lengthy and tedious tasks, such as the weaving pattern of the loom. More complex machines appear in the early 20th century, complex specific calculations through analog circuitry. The first digital electronic computer appeared during the Second World War. Since then, the speed, power consumption and multi-functionality of the computer have been increasing. In modern, the application of mechanical computers has been completely replaced by the electronic computer.\n",
      "The computer is different in form. There is still a large number of large volumes of massive computers for special scientific calculations or transactions facing large-scale organizations. A relatively small, designed for personal applications, Personal Computer, PC), is referred to as \"microcomputer\" in China. Today, today's term \"computer\" is often referred to, but now the most common application form of the computer is embedded, and the embedded computer is usually relatively simple, the size is small, and is used to control other devices - no way , Industrial robots or digital cameras.\n",
      "Research on computer science, \"Computer Technology\" refers to the total combination of multi-technical and empirical achievements derived by computer science. \"Computer Technology\" and \"Computer Science\" are two associated and different concepts, and their difference is that the former is highly reproduced by theory and the latter is as high as the theory. As for research by data as a core, it is called information technology.\n",
      "Traditionally, modern computers include at least one processing unit (typically a central processor (CPU)) and some form of memory. The processing element performs arithmetic and logical operations, and sorting and controlling the order in response to stored information. Peripherals include input devices (keyboard, mouse, joystick, etc.), output devices (display screens, printers, etc.), and input / output devices that perform two functions (such as touch screens). The peripheral device allows information from the external source and allows the results to be saved and retrieved.\n",

      "Originally, the English primip of the computer \"Computer\" refers to people engaged in data. And they often need some mechanical computing devices or analog computers.\n",
      "These early computing devices ancestors include abacus, as well as Antiki Tella Mechanical for the ancient Greeks to calculate the planet 87 BC. With the reunation of European mathematics and engineering in the late Middle Ages, the German blogger Wilhelm Schickard took the lead in developing the first computing equipment in Europe. This is a six-digit decimal addition and subtraction method, and can via the ringtone output answer. \"Complex Clock\". Use the rotating gear to operate.\n",
      "In 1642, French mathematician Braz Pasca was improved on the basis of the \"calculation ruler\" made by the UK Mathematician William Oughtred, enabling eight-bit calculations. Many products have also been sold, and become a fashionable goods at the time.\n",
      "In 1801, the French Joseph Mary Jakar improved the design of the loom, using a series of punched paper cards as a program of knitting complex patterns. Although this machine called \"Jakar Weaving Machine\" is not considered a real computer, its can be used in the process of modern computer development.\n",
      "Charles Babery conceived and designed the first fully styled computer in 1820. However, due to technical conditions, funding restrictions, and unbeatable repairs, this computer has never been admired in his life. In the late 19th century, many later proven technologies that have great significance for computer science, including punch cards and vacuum tubes. German American Statistics Herman He Lendi designed a tabulated machine, which applies a punch card to perform large-scale automatic data processing.\n",
      "In the second half of the 20th century, in order to cater to scientific calculations, many specialized, complexity, increasing analog computers were developed. These computers are mechanical or electronic models that use their specific problems as the calculation basis. From 1930 to 1940, the performance of computers was gradually powerful and versatile, and the key features of modern computers were constantly incorporated.\n",
      "In 1936, Alan Turkley was developed.\n",
      "In 1937, only 21-year-old MIT Graduate School of Science and Technology, Claude, Agriculture, published his important paper \"Symbol Analysis in Second Appliances and Switch Circuits\", and the first mention of digital electronic technology. He demonstrated how to use the switch to implement logic and math operations. Since then, he further consolidated his ideas through the study of Wanniwar Bush's differential simulator. This is an important moment that marks the beginning of the binary electronic circuit design and logic gate application, and the pioneer of these key ideas should include: Almond Stlog, he applies for a patent for a device containing a logical gate circuit; Nikola Tesla, he had applied to a circuit device containing logic gate in 1898; Li Defulster, in 1907 he used a vacuum tube instead of the relay.\n",
      "\n",
      "The so-called \"first electronic computer\" is defined along such a long-distance long-distance long-distance long-distance from which to search. On May 12, 1941, German engineer Kangrad Chuze completed his Turing the entire machine, \"Z3\", which is the first computer with automatic binary mathematical computing characteristics and feasible stylized function, but Not an \"electronic\" computer. In addition, other attention is mainly:\n",
      "Attana, Berry, 1941, Berry Computer, is the world's first electronic computer, which uses a vacuum tube calculator, binary value, can be repurchant; mysterious dragonfly in 1943 in 1943 (Colossus Computer), although the stylized capacity is extremely limited, it makes it convinced that the vacuum tube is trustworthy, and the electrical reprogramming; Harvard University's Mark No.; and binary ENIAC, full name is electronic value Point calculator, this is the first general intent computer, but since its structural design is not elasticized, it is caused to reconnect the electronic line to each of its reprogramming.\n",
      "In the Second World War of the 1940, for the training of bomber pilots, the US Navy used the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Can I develop a computer that controls flight simulator. The military's original idea is to see the data generated by the pilot simulation operation immediately on the dashboard via the computer. Unlike the previous training system Link training machine, the military planning system can simulate the aerodynamic model as much as possible to apply to a variety of different types of aircraft. So MIT created a cyclone engineering that manufactures the world's first cyclone computer, and invented the magnetic core storage device. This makes historical contributions to the development of a personal computer.\n",
      "Developing Ensenk's team further improves its designs, and eventually presents von Nobiman structure (program storage architecture) we are familiar with today. This system is the foundation of all computers today.\n",
      "In the middle and late 1940s, a large number of computers based on this system began to develop, which was the earliest in the UK. Although the first development is completed and put into operation is a small-scale lab (SMALL-Scale Experimental Machine, SSEM), the utility that is truly developed is likely to delay the storage electronic automatic calculator (EDSAC).\n",
      "In the 1950s, the vacuum tube computer resumed the status. On September 12, 1958, the integrated circuit was invented under the leadership of Robert Neuss, in the beginning of Intel.\n",
      "The microprocessor is launched soon. Computers designed from 1959 to 1964 are generally referred to as second-generation computers.\n",
      "In the 1960s, the electrostatic computer replaced it. The transistor is smaller, faster, and the price is more reliable, which makes them commercialized.\n",
      "Computers in 1964 to 1972 are generally referred to as third generation computers. A large number of integrated circuits, typical models are IBM360 series.\n",
      "By the 1970s, the introduction of physical circuit technology has greatly reduced computer production costs, and the computer has also begun to thousands of households. Computer habits after 1972 are called the fourth generation computer. Based on large-scale primary circuits, and later large-scale active circuits. Intel 4004 is the first microprocessor in Intel (Intel), is also the world's first microprocessor; released on November 15, 1971. On April 1, 1972, Intel launched an 8008 microprocessor. In 1976, Steve Jabos and Steve Wozniac founded Apple. And launch its Apple i computer. APPLE Type II computer released in May 1977. On June 1, 1979, Intel issued an 8088 microprocessor.\n",
      "In 1982, the microcomputer began to popularize and entered schools and families. In January 1982, Commodore 64 Computer was released and the price was $ 595.\n",
      "In February 1982, Intel 80286 was released. The hour pulse is increased to 20 MHz and increases the protection mode to access 640KB memory. Supports a virtual memory of more than 1MB. 2.7 million instructions per second are integrated with 134,000 electrical crystals.\n",
      "In November 1990, Microsoft released the first generation of MPC (MultiMedia PC, multimedia Personal Computer Standard): The processor is at least 80286/12 MHz (later increasing to 80386SX / 16 MHz), a disc machine, no transmission rate of not less than 150 kB / sec.\n",
      "October 10, 1994 INTEL released a 75MHz PPENTIUM processor. On November 1, 1995, Pentium Pro was released. The main frequency can reach 200MHz, complete 440 million instructions per second, and 5.5 million transistors are integrated. On January 8, 1997, Intel released Pentium MMX, enhanced games and multimedia functions.\n",
      "Thereafter, the computer's change in the computer is different. The Moore's law published in 1965 is constantly certified, and forecast is still applicable in the next 10-15 years.\n",

      "== Principle ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Although computer technology has become a fascinating rapid development since the birth of the first electronic general computer in the 1940s, today's computer still basically adopts the storage program structure, that is, von Nuiman structure. This structure enables practical general purpose computers.\n",
      "The storage program structure describes a computer into four main parts: arithmetic logic units, control circuits, memory, and input and output devices. These components are connected by a set of wire connections (in particular, when a set of lines are used for data transmission of multiple discord drawings), and is driven by a clock (of course, certain other events are also May drive the control circuit).\n",
      "Conceptually, a computer's memory can be considered as a \"cell\" unit. Each \"cell\" has a number called address; it can also store a smaller settling information. This information can be an instruction (telling the computer what to do) or data (instructions for the instruction). In principle, each \"cell\" can be stored any one.\n",
      "The arithmetic logic unit (ALU) can be referred to as the brain of the computer. It can do two types of operations:\n",
      "The first category is an arithmetic operation, such as adding subtraction of two numbers. The function of the arithmetic computing component is very limited in ALU, in fact,\n",
      "Some ALUs do not support the multiplication and division operation of the circuit level (by the user can only compose by programming). The second category is a comparison, that is, given two numbers.\n",
      "The ALU is compared to determine which one is more. The input and output system is a means of receiving information from the outside world and to the external world feedback operation result. For a standard personal computer, the input device mainly has a keyboard and mouse, and the output device is a display, printer, and many other I / O devices that will be discussed to the computer.\n",
      "The control system links the above computers. Its function is to read instructions and data from memory and input and output devices, decoding instructions,\n",
      "And to the ALU that meets the correct input of the instructions, tells the ALU which operations do for these data and return the result data to where. An important component in the control system is a counter used to keep the address where the current command is located.\n",
      "Usually this counter is accumulated as the instructions, but sometimes if the instruction indicates that it is jump, it will not be in this rule.\n",
      "The ALU and control unit (the two consensus \"since the 1980s have gradually been integrated into an integrated circuit, called a microprocessor.\n",
      "This type of computer is very intuitive: In a clock cycle, the computer gets instructions and data from the memory, then executes instructions, stores data, and then obtain the next instruction. This process is repeated until a termination instruction is obtained.\n",
      "The controller explained that the set of instructions performed by the operator is a very limited number of simple instructions. It can generally be divided into four categories: 1), data movement\n",
      "(, Such as copying a value from the storage unit a to the storage unit B) 2), the log operation (eg, calculating the sum of the storage unit A and the storage unit B, and the result returns the storage unit C) 3),\n",
      "Conditional verification (eg, if the storage unit A is 100, the next instruction address is a storage unit F) 4), the instruction sequence is changed (eg the next instruction address is a storage order. Yuan f)\n",
      "The instruction is represented by binary in the computer as a data. For example, 10110000 is a copy instruction code for an Intel X86 series microprocessor.\n",
      "The set of instructions supported by a computer is the machine language of the computer. Therefore, the use of popular machine language will make the genex software run more easily on a new computer. Therefore, for those developed by the model commercial software, they usually only pay attention to one or more different machine languages.\n",
      "More powerful small computers, large computers and servers may differ from the above computer. They usually share the task to different CPUs. Nowadays,\n",
      "Microprocessors and multi-core personal computers are also developing in this direction. Supercomples typically have a significant difference with basic storage program computers. They usually have thousands of CPUs,\n",
      "However, these design seem to be useful for specific tasks. In various computers, there are also some microcontrollers adopt a Harvard Architecture that separate procedures and data separation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Circuit implementation ==\n",
      "\n",
      "The above-mentioned conceptual design is a variety of physics. As us, one of the above, a storage program computer can be either a Babico mechanical.\n",
      "It can also be based on digital electronics. However, digital circuitry can achieve arithmetic and logical operations using 2-based number by electronic control switches such as relays.\n",
      "Shannon's papers exactly show us how to arrange relays to form a logic gate that enables simple Boolean operations. Some other scholars quickly pointed out that the use of a vacuum tube can replace the relay circuit.\n",
      "The vacuum tube was initially used as an amplifier in the radio circuit, and then began to be more and more rapid switches in the digital electronic circuit. When a pin of the tube is energized, the current can pass freely between the other two ends.\n",
      "Through logic gates, we can design a lot of complex tasks. For example, the adder is one of them.\n",
      "The device achieves two numbers in the electronic field and saves the results - such a method of implementing a particular intent in computer science, is called a algorithm.\n",
      "In the end, people have successfully made a complete ALU and controller through quantity logical door circuits. Say that it is considerable, just look at CSIRAC, this may be the smallest practical tube computer.\n",
      "The machine contains 2,000 tubes, which are also a dual-use device, that is, a total of 2000 to 4000 logic devices.\n",
      "The vacuum tube is not from the heart on the large-scale door circuit of the manufacturing scale. Expensive, unstable (especially), bloated, high energy consumption, and the speed is not fast enough - although the remote mechanical switching circuit.\n",
      "All of this has led them to be replaced by transistors in the 1960s. The latter is smaller, easy to operate, high reliability, more energy consumption, and the cost is lower.\n",
      "After the 1960s, the transistor began to gradually dispose of a large number of transistors, other electrical components, and connecting wires in an integrated circuit of a silicon plate.\n",
      "In the 1970s, the ALU and controllers were used as two parts of the CPU, and began to be integrated into a chip and called \"microprocessor.\" Along the history of the integrated circuit, you can see that the number of integrated devices on a chip has grown rapidly. The first integrated circuit only contains dozens of components, and in 2015, the number of transistors on an Intel Core I7 processor is as high as 19 billion.\n",
      "Whether it is tube, transistors or integrated circuits, they can be used as a \"storage\" component in the storage program architecture by using a trigger design mechanism.\n",
      "And in fact, the trigger is indeed used as a small-scale ultra-high-speed storage. However, there is almost no computer design using triggers to perform large-scale data storage.\n",
      "The earliest computer is to use the Williams Electronic Tube to a TV screen or a few mercury delay lines (sound waves through this line \"is extremely slow enough to be considered\" storage \"in the above)\n",
      "The transmitted electron beam then reads the data. Of course, these although effective but not very elegant methods are ultimately being replaced by magnetic storage. For example, magnetic core memory,\n",
      "The current representing the information can be manufactured in the ferrous material in which the data recovery is realized when the magnetic field is read out. Dynamic random memory is also invented. It is an integrated circuit containing a large amount of capacitance, and these capacitors are responsible for storing the intensity of data charge-charges, is defined as the value of data.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Input Output Device ==\n",
      "\n",
      "The input / output device (I / O) is a general title for devices that send external world information to the computer and returning the processing result to the external world.\n",
      "These return results may be input as a user who can visually experience, or is input as other devices controlled by the computer: for a robot, controlling the output of the computer is basically the robot itself, such as making various behaviors. .\n",
      "The type of input and output devices in the first generation of computers is very limited. The usual input device is a card reader of a punch card to import instructions and data into memory; and output devices for storage results are typically tape. With the advancement of technology, the richness of input and output devices is improved. Taking a personal computer as an example: The keyboard and mouse are the main tools of the user directly enter the information, while the display, printer, megaphone, and headphones return processing results. There are also many input devices to accept other different kinds of information, such as digital cameras, can enter images. In the input / output device, there are two categories worth noting: the first class is a secondary storage device such as a hard disk, a disc or other speed, but has a high capacity device. The second is the computer network access device, and direct data transfer between the computer implemented through them greatly enhances the value of the computer. Today, the Internet has achieved tens of millions of computers to transmit various types of data.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Program ==\n",
      "Simply put, the computer program is a sequence of the computer execution instruction. It can only be only a few instructions to perform a simple task, or it may be a complex command queue that might want to operate huge amount of data. Many computer packages contain millions of instructions, and\n",
      "Many of these instructions may be repeated. In 2005, a typical PC can perform approximately 3 billion instructions per second. Computers usually do not perform some of the complex instructions to get additional functions, more of them run those simple but numerous short instructions in accordance with programmers.\n",
      "In general, the programmers will not write instructions for the computer directly with the machine language. The result of doing it can only be cost-effective, and the efficiency is low and the vulnerability is full.\n",
      "Therefore, programmers typically write programs through \"advanced\" language, and then translate them into machine languages ​​such as interpreters or compilers.\n",
      "Some programming languages ​​look close to the machine language, such as assembler, is considered a low-level language. In other languages, such as ProLog, such as the abstract principle, completely ignore the details of the actual operation of the computer, which is a high-level language. For a specific task, the corresponding language should be selected according to its transaction, programmer skills, available tools, and customer needs, which are most important to customer demand (engineering projects in the US and Chinese military usually require ADA language).\n",
      "Computer software is another vocabulary that is not equal to computer programs. Computer software is a more inclusive technical term that includes various programs for completing tasks and all related materials. For example, a video game contains not only the program itself, but also the picture, sound, and other data content that creates a virtual game environment. In the retail market, an application on a computer is just a copy of the software facing a large number of users. Of course, the old often talk is of course Microsoft's Office software group, which includes a series of procedures that are associated with general office needs.\n",
      "Using those extremely simple machine language instructions to achieve numerous functional applications means that their programming is not destined. Windows XP This operating system program contains 40 million BSS in the C ++ advanced language source code. Of course, this is not the biggest. Such huge software scale also shows the importance of management during development. When actually programming, the program will be subdivided into each programmer to be completed within an acceptable time.\n",
      "Even so, the process of software development is still slow, and it is not foreseen and has a lot of omissions. Software Engineering, which is born, focus on how to speed up the progress and improve efficiency and quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Function library and operating system ===\n",
      "Shortly after the computer was born, people found that some specific homework must be implemented in many different programs, such as calculating certain standard mathematical functions. For efficiency considerations, the standard version of these programs is collected in a \"library\" for use in various programs. Many tasks often go to a wide range of input and output interfaces, at this time, the library used to connect can be used.\n",
      "In the 1960s, with the popularity of computer industrialization, computers were increasingly used as the treatment of different homework within an organization. Soon, special software that can be automatically arranged for operational continuity and execution. These software that control both hardware and responsible for job timing arrangements are called \"operating systems.\" An example of an early operating system is an IBM's OS / 360.\n",
      "In constant improvement, the operating system introduces the time sharing mechanism - concurrency. This makes multiple different users can \"simultaneously\" use the machine to execute their own procedures, which look like everyone has a computer. To this end, the operating system needs to provide a \"virtual machine\" to each user to separate different programs. Devices that need to operate system control are also increasing, one of which is a hard disk. Therefore, the operating system introduces file management and directory management (folder), greatly simplifies the application of such permanent storage devices. In addition, the operating system is also responsible for security control to ensure that users can only access those files that have been allowed.\n",
      "Of course, the last important steps in the development of the operating system will provide a standard graphical user interface for programs.\n",
      "Although nothing technical reasons indicate that the operating system must provide these interfaces, operating system vendors always hope and encourage software that runs on its system to maintain consistent or similar in appearance and behavioral characteristics.\n",
      "In addition to these core functions, the operating system also encapsulates a series of other common tools. Some of these although there is no significant meaning of computer management, it is useful for users. For example, Apple's Mac OS X contains a video clip app.\n",
      "Some operating systems for smaller-scale computers may have no such a wide range of features. Early microcomputers are limited by memory and processing capabilities, while embedded computers use a particularly-specific operating system or simply not, they are often directly proxy for certain functions of operating systems.\n",

      "== Application ==\n",
      "\n",
      "At first, the bulky and expensive digital computers were mainly used to perform scientific calculations, especially military issues. If ENIAC is the first to calculate the calculation of the artillery population and design the hydrogen bomb (many supercomputers still play a huge role in simulating nuclear tests). The first storage program computer CSIR MK I in Australia is responsible for assessing the rainfall situation in hydropower projects. There are also \"giant images\" programmable computers used to decrypt, such as the UK. Remove these early science or military applications, the promotion of computers in other fields is also very rapid.\n",
      "From the beginning, the storage program computer is closely related to the resolution of business problems. Before the first commercial computer, IBM was born,\n",
      "UK J. Lyons et al. Designed to create LEO for asset management or catering other commercial purposes. Due to the continuous volume and cost control, the computer begins to popularize in a smaller organization. In the 1970s microprocessor, cheap computer has become a reality. In the 1980s, personal computers were fully popular, electronic document writing and printing, computing budgets and other repetitive reports have become more and more started to rely on computers.\n",
      "As the computer is inexpensive, creative art work has also begun to use them. People use synthesizers, computer graphics and animations to create and modify sounds, images, and videos. Industrialization of video games also shows that the computer has also created new history in entertainment.\n",
      "Since the computer miniaturization, the control of the mechanical equipment has also begun to rely on the support of the computer. In fact, it is that in order to build a sufficiently small embedded computer to control the jump forward of Integrated Circuit Technology. Today I want to find some active mechanical equipment that is not controlled by computer, it is necessary to find some computer controlled equipment. Maybe the most famous computer control equipment should be non-robot, these machines have more or less appearances and some subsets of human behavior. In bulk production, industrial robots are already unusual. However, a complete manner has just stayed in science fiction or laboratory.\n",
      "Robotics is essentially physical expression links in artificial intelligence (AI artificial wisdom). The so-called artificial intelligence (Ai artificial wisdom) is a definition concept but can be sure that this discipline tries to make the computer have the current ability to have inherently, but as humans. For years, many new methods have been developed to be developed to allow computers to do things that they can do before they can do. For example, reading, playing chess. However, so far, progress is still very slow in developing a computer with human-intelligent \"integrity\" intelligence.\n",

      "The computer since the 1950s began to coordinate the tools from different places, and the US military's sage system (SAGE) is the first large-scale system in this regard. After that, a series of special-purpose commercial systems such as \"Strokes\" will continue to emerge.\n",
      "After the 1970s, computer engineers from all major institutions began to connect their computers using Telecommunications technology. Since this work has been sponsored by ARPA, its computer network is also called Arpanet. Since then, the technology used in the ARPA network quickly diffuses and evolves. This network also breaks through the scope of the university and the army, which finally formed today's international Internet. The emergence of the network results in a redefinition of computer properties and boundaries. John Gage and Bill Joy of the Sun Microsystems have pointed out: \"Network is computer\". Computer operating systems and applications have enabled access to the direction of network resources such as other computers in the network. Initially, these network devices are limited to high-end scientists, but after the 1990s, with the spread of email and worldwide technology, and inexpensive technology such as Ethernet and ADSL. The Internet has become omnipotent. Today, the total number of computers is from 10 million; the popularity of wireless interconnection technology, so that the Internet is also shaped in the mobile computing environment. For example, Wi-Fi technology widely used on a notebook computer is a representative application of wireless Internet access.\n",
      "After the Telephone Data MODEM technology, after the telephone data engine MODEM technology, the upgrade is a broadband data, which represents the new era of the network, and the speed of the slow run is changed, and the computer is also changed. Habits, more popularization of network contact messages, such as instant pass or Skype, etc., only text messaging can only be upgraded to audio and video transmission; while the cloud, big data age creates a variety of new type industries, such as network stores, Internet e-commerce, network auction, network sales, online games, network design and settling, and increasingly universal cloud data libraries or backup libraries are always optimized and changing the lives of existing humans.\n",

      "Since the advent of the world has a significant improvement in speed and ability, there have been many problems that have exceeded the capacity of the current computer.\n",
      "For some of some of the topics, traditional computers are impossible to implement, because finding a solution time can't catch up with the scale of the problem scale. Therefore, scientists began to resolve this problem with their attention to biological computing technology and quantum theory. For example, people plan to use biometric to address specific issues (DNA calculations). Due to the exponential growth mode of cell division, the DNA computing system is likely to have the ability to solve the same scale problem. Of course, such a system is directly limited to the total amount of DNA controlled.\n",

      "{'topic': 'fire', 'english_title': 'Fire', 'english': 'Fire is the rapid oxidation of a material in the exothermic chemical process of combustion, releasing heat, light, and various reaction products.\\nFire is hot because the conversion of the weak double bond in molecular oxygen, O2, to the stronger bonds in the combustion products carbon dioxide and water releases energy (418 kJ per 32 g of O2); the bond energies of the fuel play only a minor role here.  At a certain point in the combustion reaction, called the ignition point, flames are produced.  The flame is the visible portion of the fire. Flames consist primarily of carbon dioxide, water vapor, oxygen and nitrogen.  If hot enough, the gases may become ionized to produce plasma. Depending on the substances alight, and any impurities outside, the color of the flame and the fire\\'s intensity will be different.\\nFire in its most common form can result in conflagration, which has the potential to cause physical damage through burning.  Fire is an important process that affects ecological systems around the globe. The positive effects of fire include stimulating growth and maintaining various ecological systems.\\nIts negative effects include hazard to life and property, atmospheric pollution, and water contamination. If fire removes protective vegetation, heavy rainfall may lead to an increase in soil erosion by water. Also, when vegetation is burned, the nitrogen it contains is released into the atmosphere, unlike elements such as potassium and phosphorus which remain in the ash and are quickly recycled into the soil. This loss of nitrogen caused by a fire produces a long-term reduction in the fertility of the soil, but this fecundity can potentially be recovered as molecular nitrogen in the atmosphere is \"fixed\" and converted to ammonia by natural phenomena such as lightning and by leguminous plants that are \"nitrogen-fixing\" such as clover, peas, and green beans.\\nFire has been used by humans in rituals, in agriculture for clearing land, for cooking, generating heat and light, for signaling, propulsion purposes, smelting, forging, incineration of waste, cremation, and as a weapon or mode of destruction.\\n\\n\\n== Physical properties ==\\n\\n\\n=== Chemistry ===\\n\\nFires start when a flammable or a combustible material, in combination with a sufficient quantity of an oxidizer such as oxygen gas or another oxygen-rich compound (though non-oxygen oxidizers exist), is exposed to a source of heat or ambient temperature above the flash point for the fuel/oxidizer mix, and is able to sustain a rate of rapid oxidation that produces a chain reaction. This is commonly called the fire tetrahedron. Fire cannot exist without all of these elements in place and in the right proportions. For example, a flammable liquid will start burning only if the fuel and oxygen are in the right proportions. Some fuel-oxygen mixes may require a catalyst, a substance that is not consumed, when added, in any chemical reaction during combustion, but which enables the reactants to combust more readily.\\nOnce ignited, a chain reaction must take place whereby fires can sustain their own heat by the further release of heat energy in the process of combustion and may propagate, provided there is a continuous supply of an oxidizer and fuel.\\nIf the oxidizer is oxygen from the surrounding air, the presence of a force of gravity, or of some similar force caused by acceleration, is necessary to produce convection, which removes combustion products and brings a supply of oxygen to the fire. Without gravity, a fire rapidly surrounds itself with its own combustion products and non-oxidizing gases from the air, which exclude oxygen and extinguish the fire. Because of this, the risk of fire in a spacecraft is small when it is coasting in inertial flight. This does not apply if oxygen is supplied to the fire by some process other than thermal convection.\\nFire can be extinguished by removing any one of the elements of the fire tetrahedron. Consider a natural gas flame, such as from a stove-top burner. The fire can be extinguished by any of the following:\\n\\nturning off the gas supply, which removes the fuel source;\\ncovering the flame completely, which smothers the flame as the combustion both uses the available oxidizer (the oxygen in the air) and displaces it from the area around the flame with CO2;\\napplication of water, which removes heat from the fire faster than the fire can produce it (similarly, blowing hard on a flame will displace the heat of the currently burning gas from its fuel source, to the same end), or\\napplication of a retardant chemical such as Halon to the flame, which retards the chemical reaction itself until the rate of combustion is too slow to maintain the chain reaction.In contrast, fire is intensified by increasing the overall rate of combustion. Methods to do this include balancing the input of fuel and oxidizer to stoichiometric proportions, increasing fuel and oxidizer input in this balanced mix, increasing the ambient temperature so the fire\\'s own heat is better able to sustain combustion, or providing a catalyst, a non-reactant medium in which the fuel and oxidizer can more readily react.\\n\\n\\n=== Flame ===\\n\\nA flame is a mixture of reacting gases and solids emitting visible, infrared, and sometimes ultraviolet light, the frequency spectrum of which depends on the chemical composition of the burning material and intermediate reaction products. In many cases, such as the burning of organic matter, for example wood, or the incomplete combustion of gas, incandescent solid particles called soot produce the familiar red-orange glow of \"fire\". This light has a continuous spectrum. Complete combustion of gas has a dim blue color due to the emission of single-wavelength radiation from various electron transitions in the excited molecules formed in the flame. Usually oxygen is involved, but hydrogen burning in chlorine also produces a flame, producing hydrogen chloride (HCl). Other possible combinations producing flames, amongst many, are fluorine and hydrogen, and hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide. Hydrogen and hydrazine/UDMH flames are similarly pale blue, while burning boron and its compounds, evaluated in mid-20th century as a high energy fuel for jet and rocket engines, emits intense green flame, leading to its informal nickname of \"Green Dragon\".\\nThe glow of a flame is complex. Black-body radiation is emitted from soot, gas, and fuel particles, though the soot particles are too small to behave like perfect blackbodies. There is also photon emission by de-excited atoms and molecules in the gases. Much of the radiation is emitted in the visible and infrared bands. The color depends on temperature for the black-body radiation, and on chemical makeup for the emission spectra. The dominant color in a flame changes with temperature. The photo of the forest fire in Canada is an excellent example of this variation. Near the ground, where most burning is occurring, the fire is white, the hottest color possible for organic material in general, or yellow. Above the yellow region, the color changes to orange, which is cooler, then red, which is cooler still. Above the red region, combustion no longer occurs, and the uncombusted carbon particles are visible as black smoke.\\nThe common distribution of a flame under normal gravity conditions depends on convection, as soot tends to rise to the top of a general flame, as in a candle in normal gravity conditions, making it yellow. In micro gravity or zero gravity, such as an environment in outer space, convection no longer occurs, and the flame becomes spherical, with a tendency to become more blue and more efficient (although it may go out if not moved steadily, as the CO2 from combustion does not disperse as readily in micro gravity, and tends to smother the flame). There are several possible explanations for this difference, of which the most likely is that the temperature is sufficiently evenly distributed that soot is not formed and complete combustion occurs. Experiments by NASA reveal that diffusion flames in micro gravity allow more soot to be completely oxidized after they are produced than diffusion flames on Earth, because of a series of mechanisms that behave differently in micro gravity when compared to normal gravity conditions. These discoveries have potential applications in applied science and industry, especially concerning fuel efficiency.\\nIn combustion engines, various steps are taken to eliminate a flame. The method depends mainly on whether the fuel is oil, wood, or a high-energy fuel such as jet fuel.\\n\\n\\n==== Typical adiabatic temperatures ====\\n\\nThe adiabatic flame temperature of a given fuel and oxidizer pair is that at which the gases achieve stable combustion.\\n\\nOxy–dicyanoacetylene 4,990 °C (9,000 °F)\\nOxy–acetylene 3,480 °C (6,300 °F)\\nOxyhydrogen 2,800 °C (5,100 °F)\\nAir–acetylene 2,534 °C (4,600 °F)\\nBlowtorch (air–MAPP gas) 2,200 °C (4,000 °F)\\nBunsen burner (air–natural gas) 1,300 to 1,600 °C (2,400 to 2,900 °F)\\nCandle (air–paraffin)  1,000 °C (1,800 °F)\\n\\n\\n== Fire science & ecology ==\\n\\nEvery natural ecosystem has its own fire regime, and the organisms in those ecosystems are adapted to or dependent upon that fire regime. Fire creates a mosaic of different habitat patches, each at a different stage of succession. Different species of plants, animals, and microbes specialize in exploiting a particular stage, and by creating these different types of patches, fire allows a greater number of species to exist within a landscape.\\nFire science is a branch of physical science which includes fire behavior, dynamics, and combustion. Applications of fire science include fire protection, fire investigation, and wildfire management.\\n\\n\\n== Fossil record ==\\n\\nThe fossil record of fire first appears with the establishment of a land-based flora in the Middle Ordovician period, 470 million years ago, permitting the accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere as never before, as the new hordes of land plants pumped it out as a waste product. When this concentration rose above 13%, it permitted the possibility of wildfire.   Wildfire is first recorded in the Late Silurian fossil record, 420 million years ago, by fossils of charcoalified plants. Apart from a controversial gap in the Late Devonian, charcoal is present ever since. The level of atmospheric oxygen is closely related to the prevalence of charcoal: clearly oxygen is the key factor in the abundance of wildfire.  Fire also became more abundant when grasses radiated and became the dominant component of many ecosystems, around 6 to 7 million years ago; this kindling provided tinder which allowed for the more rapid spread of fire.  These widespread fires may have initiated a positive feedback process, whereby they produced a warmer, drier climate more conducive to fire.\\n\\n\\n== Human control ==\\n\\nThe ability to control fire was a dramatic change in the habits of early humans. Making fire to generate heat and light made it possible for people to cook food, simultaneously increasing the variety and availability of nutrients and reducing disease by killing organisms in the food. The heat produced would also help people stay warm in cold weather, enabling them to live in cooler climates. Fire also kept nocturnal predators at bay. Evidence of cooked food is found from 1 million years ago, although fire was probably not used in a controlled fashion until 400,000 years ago. There is some evidence that fire may have been used in a controlled fashion about 1 million years ago. Evidence becomes widespread around 50 to 100 thousand years ago, suggesting regular use from this time; interestingly, resistance to air pollution started to evolve in human populations at a similar point in time.  The use of fire became progressively more sophisticated, with it being used to create charcoal and to control wildlife from \\'tens of thousands\\' of years ago.Fire has also been used for centuries as a method of torture and execution, as evidenced by death by burning as well as torture devices such as the iron boot, which could be filled with water, oil, or even lead and then heated over an open fire to the agony of the wearer.\\n\\nBy the Neolithic Revolution, during the introduction of grain-based agriculture, people all over the world used fire as a tool in landscape management. These fires were typically controlled burns or \"cool fires\", as opposed to uncontrolled \"hot fires\", which damage the soil. Hot fires destroy plants and animals, and endanger communities. This is especially a problem in the forests of today where traditional burning is prevented in order to encourage the growth of timber crops. Cool fires are generally conducted in the spring and autumn. They clear undergrowth, burning up biomass that could trigger a hot fire should it get too dense. They provide a greater variety of environments, which encourages game and plant diversity. For humans, they make dense, impassable forests traversable. Another human use for fire in regards to landscape management is its use to clear land for agriculture. Slash-and-burn agriculture is still common across much of tropical Africa, Asia and South America. \"For small farmers, it is a convenient way to clear overgrown areas and release nutrients from standing vegetation back into the soil\", said Miguel Pinedo-Vasquez, an ecologist at the Earth Institute’s Center for Environmental Research and Conservation. However this useful strategy is also problematic. Growing population, fragmentation of forests and warming climate are making the earth\\'s surface more prone to ever-larger escaped fires. These harm ecosystems and human infrastructure, cause health problems, and send up spirals of carbon and soot that may encourage even more warming of the atmosphere – and thus feed back into more fires. Globally today, as much as 5 million square kilometres – an area more than half the size of the United States – burns in a given year.There are numerous modern applications of fire. In its broadest sense, fire is used by nearly every human being on earth in a controlled setting every day. Users of internal combustion vehicles employ fire every time they drive. Thermal power stations provide electricity for a large percentage of humanity.\\n\\nThe use of fire in warfare has a long history. Fire was the basis of all early thermal weapons. Homer detailed the use of fire by Greek soldiers who hid in a wooden horse to burn Troy during the Trojan war. Later the Byzantine fleet used Greek fire to attack ships and men. In the First World War, the first modern flamethrowers were used by infantry, and were successfully mounted on armoured vehicles in the Second World War. In the latter war, incendiary bombs were used by Axis and Allies alike, notably on Tokyo, Rotterdam, London, Hamburg and, notoriously, at Dresden; in the latter two cases firestorms were deliberately caused in which a ring of fire surrounding each city was drawn inward by an updraft caused by a central cluster of fires. The United States Army Air Force also extensively used incendiaries against Japanese targets in the latter months of the war, devastating entire cities constructed primarily of wood and paper houses. The use of napalm was employed in July 1944, towards the end of the Second World War; although its use did not gain public attention until the Vietnam War. Molotov cocktails were also used.\\n\\n\\n=== Use as fuel ===\\n\\nSetting fuel aflame releases usable energy. Wood was a prehistoric fuel, and is still viable today. The use of fossil fuels, such as petroleum, natural gas, and coal, in power plants supplies the vast majority of the world\\'s electricity today; the International Energy Agency states that nearly 80% of the world\\'s power came from these sources in 2002. The fire in a power station is used to heat water, creating steam that drives turbines. The turbines then spin an electric generator to produce electricity. Fire is also used to provide mechanical work directly, in both external and internal combustion engines.\\nThe unburnable solid remains of a combustible material left after a fire is called clinker if its melting point is below the flame temperature, so that it fuses and then solidifies as it cools, and ash if its melting point is above the flame temperature.\\n\\n\\n== Protection and prevention ==\\n\\nWildfire prevention programs around the world may employ techniques such as wildland fire use and prescribed or controlled burns. Wildland fire use refers to any fire of natural causes that is monitored but allowed to burn. Controlled burns are fires ignited by government agencies under less dangerous weather conditions.Fire fighting services are provided in most developed areas to extinguish or contain uncontrolled fires. Trained firefighters use fire apparatus, water supply resources such as water mains and fire hydrants or they might use A and B class foam depending on what is feeding the fire.\\nFire prevention is intended to reduce sources of ignition.  Fire prevention also includes education to teach people how to avoid causing fires. Buildings, especially schools and tall buildings, often conduct fire drills to inform and prepare citizens on how to react to a building fire. Purposely starting destructive fires constitutes arson and is a crime in most jurisdictions.Model building codes require passive fire protection and active fire protection systems to minimize damage resulting from a fire. The most common form of active fire protection is fire sprinklers. To maximize passive fire protection of buildings, building materials and furnishings in most developed countries are tested for fire-resistance, combustibility and flammability. Upholstery, carpeting and plastics used in vehicles and vessels are also tested.\\nWhere fire prevention and fire protection have failed to prevent damage, fire insurance can mitigate the financial impact.\\n\\n\\n== Restoration ==\\n\\nDifferent restoration methods and measures are used depending on the type of fire damage that occurred. Restoration after fire damage can be performed by property management teams, building maintenance personnel, or by the homeowners themselves; however, contacting a certified professional fire damage restoration specialist is often regarded as the safest way to restore fire damaged property due to their training and extensive experience. Most are usually listed under \"Fire and Water Restoration\" and they can help speed repairs, whether for individual homeowners or for the largest of institutions.Fire and Water Restoration companies are regulated by the appropriate state\\'s Department of Consumer Affairs – usually the state contractors license board. In California, all Fire and Water Restoration companies must register with the California Contractors State License Board. Presently, the California Contractors State License Board has no specific classification for \"water and fire damage restoration.\" Hence, the Contractor\\'s State License Board requires both an asbestos certification (ASB) as well as a demolition classification (C-21) in order to perform Fire and Water Restoration work.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== Notes ===\\n\\n\\n=== Citations ===\\n\\n\\n=== Sources ===\\nHaung, Kai (2009).

Fire\" from Discover magazine', 'chinese_title': 'fire ', 'chinese': 'Fire (English: fire) is a strong oxidation reaction in the biopsy process, which is released in the form of light and heat and produces a large amount of product. Slow oxidation reactions, such as rust or digestion is not in the above definition.\\nThe visible portion of the fire is called the flame, and may exhibit different shapes as the vibration of the particles can occur in the form of a plasma (fourth state, similar gas) when the temperature is sufficiently high. The material and pureness of the flame will be different in the material and purity of the combustion.\\nFire must have flammable materials, high heat or temperature, oxidant and chemical four coexistence to make fire, according to quality conservation law, fire does not disappear the atom of the burner, only transforms the molecules of the burner by chemical reaction Type. When the fire is out of control, it is often referred to as a fire or fire.\\nAll known human society use fire, the use of fire is one of the universal cultural customs; before modern people evolved, the ancient people are creatures, which is modern human in biological ancestors, such as an Ertilist, It may be known to use fire before or earlier in a million years ago.\\nFire is one of the important factors affecting the global ecosystem. The positive impact of fire can maintain a variety of ecosystems and stimulate their growth. Human use fire to cook, heat, generate signal, lighting, and advancement. The negative impact of fire includes water pollution, soil loss, air pollution, and harm to life and property. A greenhouse effect that has increased global temperature is one of the reasons why the carbon dioxide produced from burning fossil fuels.\\n\\n\\n== Nature ==\\n\\n\\n=== Chemical ===\\n\\nBurning tetrahedron: oxygen, thermal, fuel and chain reaction\\nWhen flammable substances (fuels) and sufficient amounts of oxidants (such as oxygen, high oxygen content or other non-oxygen-free oxidant) are mixed, exposed to a heat source or a temperature higher than the flash point of the fuel and oxidant mixture When it is burned, the fast oxidation reaction can be maintained. The chain reaction is formed, generally referred to as fuel, oxidant, and heat and chain reaction are combustion tetrahedr. If there is no such element, or the proportion is not pair, it cannot be burned, for example, the combustible liquid can only be burned in a certain scale in a certain scale, and some fuel and oxidant mixtures need to be combustion, and the catalyst is maintained before and after the reaction. When the substance varies, but when there is a catalyst, the fuel and oxidant can be combusted. After the fire is ignited, the fuel may have a chain reaction as long as the temperature is maintained by thermal energy, and a chain reaction occurs. If a continuous supply fuel and an oxidant, the fire may spread.\\nIf the combustion oxidant is from the surrounding air, gravity or other acceleration to produce convection, the combustion product is taken away, and the oxygen is supplemented, which helps continue to combust. If there is no convection, the fuel will be surrounded by the surrounding combustion products and the non-flammable gas in the air, the fire will extinguish due to not sufficient oxygen.\\nAs long as you go to any one of the four sides, the fire will go out. Taking a flame of a natural gas as a fuel as an example, any of the following methods can be fired.\\n\\nClose natural gas and remove fuel.\\nCover the flames, making the flames, consuming oxygen, producing carbon dioxide.\\nWash, quickly remove heat, blow flame, so that the gas being burned exits the fuel source, is also a method.\\nWhen the flame retardant (such as sea dragon) is added to the flame, the flame retardant can slow the chemical reaction, allowing the combustion rate to slow until the continuous chain reaction. If you speed up the speed of burning, the fire will become strong. Such a method includes balancing the amount of fuel and the oxidant according to the proportion of the reaction, and increase the ambient temperature, so that the combustion can be continued by combustion, or the addition of the catalyst to make the fuel and oxidant more easily reacted.\\n\\n\\n=== Fire ===\\n\\nThe flame is a mixture of reacted gases and solids, which will release visible light, and even ultraviolet rays, and its emission spectrum is determined according to the chemical composition of combustion substance and intermediate product. Most of the cases, such as combustion like organic substances such as wood, or the incomplete burning of the gas, the incandescent carbon black forms a familiar orange red flame.\\n. The spectra of such flames is a continuous spectrum. The complete combustion of the gas will have a light blue flame, which is a single wavelength radiation produced by various electronic transitions of excited molecules formed in flames. The flame is generally related to oxygen, but hydrogen is combustion in chlorine gas to produce flame, and hydrogen chloride is formed. Other mixing of combustions produce flames include fluorine gas and hydrogen, and fuel ammonia and tetrazride of spacecraft.\\nThe flame is relatively complex, carbon black, gas, and fuel particles produce black radiation, but the carbon black particles are too small, and the gas is not approximately an ideal black body, the atomic and molecules of the gas will release photons when the gas is returned to the ground state. Most of the radiation is in the range of visible light and infrared rays, and its color is different from the temperature of the black body radiation, and also related to the emission spectrum of the chemical. The main color and temperature of the flame are related. In the photo of the general forest fire, these differences can be explained, for example near the ground, that is, most parts of the burning, the flame is white (generally organic material combustion produces the highest temperature color ) Or yellow. In the yellow area, the flame becomes orange or red, and the temperature is slowly decreased, and the combustion reaction is no longer in the red area. Unburned carbon particles form visible black smoke.\\nIn general gravity, the shape of the flame is related to convective, the general flame of carbon black will drift to the top of the flame, just like the flame of the candle, and red. If there is no convection, there is no convection, the flame will become a round sphere in a micro-gravity or no convection, and the combustion efficiency is higher (but if there is no continuous movement, the flame will be due to the product after burning It could not be released quickly under micro-gravity, and the flame was extinguished. There are many different interpretations of the difference. Most likely is that its temperature is very uniform, and there is no carbon black, and it has caused complete burning .NASA in space Experiments Instructions In the micro-gravity of the flames, more carbon black is completely oxidized than the flies under the general gravity, as the reaction mechanism under micro-gravity is different from the reaction mechanism under general gravity. These findings are in application science and industry. There is a value of application, including improving fuel efficiency.\\n\\n\\n=== Hot ===\\n\\nThe fire will generate heat or the transfer of energy is energy.\\n\\n\\n==== Typical temperature of fire and flame ====\\nHydrogen flame: about 2,000 ° C (3,600 ° F 2,273.15 ° K)\\nLivella: about 1,300 ° C (2,372 ° F 1,573.15 ° K) to 1,600 ° C (2,912 ° F 1,873.15 ° K)\\nSpray flame: 1,300 ° C (2,372 ° F 1,573.15 ° K)\\nCandle flame: 1,000 ° C (1,832 ° F 1,273.15 ° K)\\nLow temperature candle flame: 50-60 ° C (323.1500K-333.1500K) format\\n\\nSolden cigarette:\\nTemperature when there is no smoking: on both sides of the ignition part: 400 ° C (752 ° F 673.15 ° K), ignition part of the middle: 585 ° C (1,085 ° F 858.15 ° K)\\nTemperature at the time of smoking: ignition of 700 ° C (1,292 ° F 973.15 ° K)\\nThe temperature in the middle is relatively high\\n\\n\\n==== Different appearance flame temperature ====\\nThe temperature of the combustion carbon can be identified by the color and appearance of the flame:\\n\\nred\\nIt is barely visible: 525 ° C (977 ° F 798.15 ° K)\\nDark Red: 700 ° C (1,292 ° F 973.15 ° K)\\nDark cherry pink: 800 ° C (1,472 ° F 1,073.15 ° K)\\nCherry Red: 900 ° C (1,652 ° F 1,173.15 ° K)\\nBright cherry red: 1,000 ° C (1,832 ° F 1,273.15 ° K)\\nOrange\\nOrange: 1,100 ° C (2,012 ° F 1,373.15 ° K)\\nBright orange: 1,200 ° C (2,192 ° F 1,473.15 ° K)\\nwhite\\nGeneral White: 1,300 ° C (2,372 ° F 1,573.15 ° K)\\nBright white: 1,400 ° C (2,552 ° F 1,673.15 ° K)\\nGyany: 1,500 ° C (2,732 ° F 1,773.15 ° K) Overall flame temperature is not determined, but the substance.\\n\\n\\n== Control fire ==\\n\\n\\n=== Original human use ===\\n\\nUse fire to provide one of the heat and light of human beings. Early human beings retain fire from the fire from nature. Later, I learned to use a diamond to reflate, by rapid rotation of the pointer to the wood, frictionally heat, and acquired the fire source. There is a drill, with a bow drill. There is also a fire by tapping the stone. Learn to use fire to make humans to settle in a cold climate. The fire is used to cook more digestible cooked food, lighting, warm, drive the beast, heat treatment materials, etc. Archaeological studies show that living in China in China can have control. Near East human beings can live in a fire. But the skills of using fire are only 400,000 years ago.\\n\\n\\n=== Modern human use ===\\nCombustion wood is the earliest fire. Trees provide a lot of energy necessary for humans (such as campfire, torch), so call wood or firewood. Different trees have different firewood. \"Dingding · Fire\" lists all kinds of firewood cooking: \"Sang firefighting: boiled, main Yi people. Cook old ducks and meat, etc., can make extremely rotten, can solve all poison, 柴 不 作. Rice Spike: Cooking the meal, the eating soul to the five internal organs. Wheat fire: boiled rice, the main consumption of thirst throat, Liushui. Pine fireworks: boiled, strong bones, boiled tea is not suitable. 栎 firefight: boiled pork Eat, don\\'t do the wind, boiled chicken sanquy and other things. Mao Fire: the diet of the cater, the main eye is detoxification. Log fire, bamboo fire: Yip all nourishing medicine. Charcoal: Yip tea, delicious and beautiful火: 砻 砻 火, branch, can be used in two pots, the southerners are more useful, and their fees are half-fire, and they are in the spring, and there is a hurt. \"\\nIn modern times, human beings use fire power to generate electricity with coal, oil and natural gas, and the fire power generation accounts for about 70% of total power generation. Fossil fuels such as gasoline and diesel are also automotive, locomotive to the energy source of the aircraft.\\n\\n\\n== Fire and ancient traditional culture ==\\n\\nFire and combustion are often used in religious ceremonies and symbols. There are at least two senses:\\n\\nFire and water represent the clean, disinfection, and more than the case where there is no disinfection, the needle must be fired to avoid wound infection; \"Bible · Saiao Shu\", Saravel is used in vitality Remove the carbon carbon from the altar to clean the sin of Sai Ya lip.\\nThe combustion representative will send things to the spiritual world. Comprehension, Chinese folk beliefs often use the ancestors to burn in the ancestors (or called paper money or gold and silver paper, Guangdong called yin paper), paper car, paper house, etc. The copy will be incinerated at the end of the ceremony, above the heavens; Buddhism\\'s Tempse has a fire for (or claimed to protect the mobility), and it is supplied to the Buddha and Bodhisattva, the fire god, etc.\\nZorus-German believes that the fire is the earliest creation of Aura · Mazda, symbolizing the absolute and good, and the temple has a sacrifice to ignite the fire, also known as \"worship\".\\nAncient people understand nature, try to classify natural phenomena, and often think that fire is one of the indivisible elements. Ancient Greeks believe that all materials in the world are mixed by air, water, soil and fire in different proportions. Fire is also one of the five elements of Chinese traditional culture. The five elements are each other, of which wood fire, fire soil, water, fire, fire. Toned C, Ding is fire. Chinese medicine often said that he was hot (Guangdong called it as hot), he went to fire, and later found to be related to the purity of Western medicine.\\nThe Chinese folklore found that the fire of the fire was listed as one of the three emperors, and the ancient fire is \"the essence of Yang.\" \"Han Han Shu\" Zhi 14th: \"The fire is also the feet of the sun.\" Ming Dynasty thoughtfully took Huyan Wu to use stone to take a fire, he believes that the fire will affect the life. He said: \"The ancients used fires to take the wood, and there were four incompets of five lines.\" Su Wen \"Yellow Emperor: Strong fire is scattered, and you are angry. Today, everything is taken on the stone, its sex is fierce, not suitable, and there are many illness, and the birth is self-reduced. \"\\nIn addition, the fire is an symbol that often occurs in literature and religious fields. In the Bible · Acts, the Holy Spirit is called the tongue as a flame showed and coming; \"Bible · Genesis\" mentioned that when God rushed Adam Xuma to the Garden of Eden, I set up a baseus and four sides. Turn the flame.\\nIn the fire, it is possible to burn along the way, such as the famous \"fire bicycles\" of the Three Kingdoms, so the fire has the meaning of \"inheritance\", commonly known as \"shipping\". In modern times, there is a ritual of the Olympic Holy Fire, there is inheritance of flame, and the meaning of endless.\\n\\n\\n== Related entries ==\\nflame\\nFire\\nThermal energy\\nFire extinguisher\\ncombustion\\nAggregate\\nCrack\\nFire triangle\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nEntries starting with \"fire\"\\n\\n\\n== Source ==\\n\\n\\n== Reference material ==\\n\"Double Collection\"\\nLENTILE, ZACHARY A .; SMITH, Alistair MS; Falkowski, Michael J .; Hudak, Andrew T .; Morgan, Penelope; Lewis, Sarah A .; Gssler, Paul E .; Benson, Nate C.

       "'Fire is the rapid oxidation of a material in the exothermic chemical process of combustion, releasing heat, light, and various reaction products.\\nFire is hot because the conversion of the weak double bond in molecular oxygen, O2, to the stronger bonds in the combustion products carbon dioxide and water releases energy (418 kJ per 32 g of O2); the bond energies of the fuel play only a minor role here.  At a certain point in the combustion reaction, called the ignition point, flames are produced.  The flame is the visible portion of the fire. Flames consist primarily of carbon dioxide, water vapor, oxygen and nitrogen.  If hot enough, the gases may become ionized to produce plasma. Depending on the substances alight, and any impurities outside, the color of the flame and the fire\\'s intensity will be different.\\nFire in its most common form can result in conflagration, which has the potential to cause physical damage through burning.  Fire is an important process that affects ecological systems around the globe. The positive effects of fire include stimulating growth and maintaining various ecological systems.\\nIts negative effects include hazard to life and property, atmospheric pollution, and water contamination. If fire removes protective vegetation, heavy rainfall may lead to an increase in soil erosion by water. Also, when vegetation is burned, the nitrogen it contains is released into the atmosphere, unlike elements such as potassium and phosphorus which remain in the ash and are quickly recycled into the soil. This loss of nitrogen caused by a fire produces a long-term reduction in the fertility of the soil, but this fecundity can potentially be recovered as molecular nitrogen in the atmosphere is \"fixed\" and converted to ammonia by natural phenomena such as lightning and by leguminous plants that are \"nitrogen-fixing\" such as clover, peas, and green beans.\\nFire has been used by humans in rituals, in agriculture for clearing land, for cooking, generating heat and light, for signaling, propulsion purposes, smelting, forging, incineration of waste, cremation, and as a weapon or mode of destruction.\\n\\n\\n== Physical properties ==\\n\\n\\n=== Chemistry ===\\n\\nFires start when a flammable or a combustible material, in combination with a sufficient quantity of an oxidizer such as oxygen gas or another oxygen-rich compound (though non-oxygen oxidizers exist), is exposed to a source of heat or ambient temperature above the flash point for the fuel/oxidizer mix, and is able to sustain a rate of rapid oxidation that produces a chain reaction. This is commonly called the fire tetrahedron. Fire cannot exist without all of these elements in place and in the right proportions. For example, a flammable liquid will start burning only if the fuel and oxygen are in the right proportions. Some fuel-oxygen mixes may require a catalyst, a substance that is not consumed, when added, in any chemical reaction during combustion, but which enables the reactants to combust more readily.\\nOnce ignited, a chain reaction must take place whereby fires can sustain their own heat by the further release of heat energy in the process of combustion and may propagate, provided there is a continuous supply of an oxidizer and fuel.\\nIf the oxidizer is oxygen from the surrounding air, the presence of a force of gravity, or of some similar force caused by acceleration, is necessary to produce convection, which removes combustion products and brings a supply of oxygen to the fire. Without gravity, a fire rapidly surrounds itself with its own combustion products and non-oxidizing gases from the air, which exclude oxygen and extinguish the fire. Because of this, the risk of fire in a spacecraft is small when it is coasting in inertial flight. This does not apply if oxygen is supplied to the fire by some process other than thermal convection.\\nFire can be extinguished by removing any one of the elements of the fire tetrahedron. Consider a natural gas flame, such as from a stove-top burner. The fire can be extinguished by any of the following:\\n\\nturning off the gas supply, which removes the fuel source;\\ncovering the flame completely, which smothers the flame as the combustion both uses the available oxidizer (the oxygen in the air) and displaces it from the area around the flame with CO2;\\napplication of water, which removes heat from the fire faster than the fire can produce it (similarly, blowing hard on a flame will displace the heat of the currently burning gas from its fuel source, to the same end), or\\napplication of a retardant chemical such as Halon to the flame, which retards the chemical reaction itself until the rate of combustion is too slow to maintain the chain reaction.In contrast, fire is intensified by increasing the overall rate of combustion. Methods to do this include balancing the input of fuel and oxidizer to stoichiometric proportions, increasing fuel and oxidizer input in this balanced mix, increasing the ambient temperature so the fire\\'s own heat is better able to sustain combustion, or providing a catalyst, a non-reactant medium in which the fuel and oxidizer can more readily react.\\n\\n\\n=== Flame ===\\n\\nA flame is a mixture of reacting gases and solids emitting visible, infrared, and sometimes ultraviolet light, the frequency spectrum of which depends on the chemical composition of the burning material and intermediate reaction products. In many cases, such as the burning of organic matter, for example wood, or the incomplete combustion of gas, incandescent solid particles called soot produce the familiar red-orange glow of \"fire\". This light has a continuous spectrum. Complete combustion of gas has a dim blue color due to the emission of single-wavelength radiation from various electron transitions in the excited molecules formed in the flame. Usually oxygen is involved, but hydrogen burning in chlorine also produces a flame, producing hydrogen chloride (HCl). Other possible combinations producing flames, amongst many, are fluorine and hydrogen, and hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide. Hydrogen and hydrazine/UDMH flames are similarly pale blue, while burning boron and its compounds, evaluated in mid-20th century as a high energy fuel for jet and rocket engines, emits intense green flame, leading to its informal nickname of \"Green Dragon\".\\nThe glow of a flame is complex. Black-body radiation is emitted from soot, gas, and fuel particles, though the soot particles are too small to behave like perfect blackbodies. There is also photon emission by de-excited atoms and molecules in the gases. Much of the radiation is emitted in the visible and infrared bands. The color depends on temperature for the black-body radiation, and on chemical makeup for the emission spectra. The dominant color in a flame changes with temperature. The photo of the forest fire in Canada is an excellent example of this variation. Near the ground, where most burning is occurring, the fire is white, the hottest color possible for organic material in general, or yellow. Above the yellow region, the color changes to orange, which is cooler, then red, which is cooler still. Above the red region, combustion no longer occurs, and the uncombusted carbon particles are visible as black smoke.\\nThe common distribution of a flame under normal gravity conditions depends on convection, as soot tends to rise to the top of a general flame, as in a candle in normal gravity conditions, making it yellow. In micro gravity or zero gravity, such as an environment in outer space, convection no longer occurs, and the flame becomes spherical, with a tendency to become more blue and more efficient (although it may go out if not moved steadily, as the CO2 from combustion does not disperse as readily in micro gravity, and tends to smother the flame). There are several possible explanations for this difference, of which the most likely is that the temperature is sufficiently evenly distributed that soot is not formed and complete combustion occurs. Experiments by NASA reveal that diffusion flames in micro gravity allow more soot to be completely oxidized after they are produced than diffusion flames on Earth, because of a series of mechanisms that behave differently in micro gravity when compared to normal gravity conditions. These discoveries have potential applications in applied science and industry, especially concerning fuel efficiency.\\nIn combustion engines, various steps are taken to eliminate a flame. The method depends mainly on whether the fuel is oil, wood, or a high-energy fuel such as jet fuel.\\n\\n\\n==== Typical adiabatic temperatures ====\\n\\nThe adiabatic flame temperature of a given fuel and oxidizer pair is that at which the gases achieve stable combustion.\\n\\nOxy–dicyanoacetylene 4,990 °C (9,000 °F)\\nOxy–acetylene 3,480 °C (6,300 °F)\\nOxyhydrogen 2,800 °C (5,100 °F)\\nAir–acetylene 2,534 °C (4,600 °F)\\nBlowtorch (air–MAPP gas) 2,200 °C (4,000 °F)\\nBunsen burner (air–natural gas) 1,300 to 1,600 °C (2,400 to 2,900 °F)\\nCandle (air–paraffin)  1,000 °C (1,800 °F)\\n\\n\\n== Fire science & ecology ==\\n\\nEvery natural ecosystem has its own fire regime, and the organisms in those ecosystems are adapted to or dependent upon that fire regime. Fire creates a mosaic of different habitat patches, each at a different stage of succession. Different species of plants, animals, and microbes specialize in exploiting a particular stage, and by creating these different types of patches, fire allows a greater number of species to exist within a landscape.\\nFire science is a branch of physical science which includes fire behavior, dynamics, and combustion. Applications of fire science include fire protection, fire investigation, and wildfire management.\\n\\n\\n== Fossil record ==\\n\\nThe fossil record of fire first appears with the establishment of a land-based flora in the Middle Ordovician period, 470 million years ago, permitting the accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere as never before, as the new hordes of land plants pumped it out as a waste product. When this concentration rose above 13%, it permitted the possibility of wildfire.   Wildfire is first recorded in the Late Silurian fossil record, 420 million years ago, by fossils of charcoalified plants. Apart from a controversial gap in the Late Devonian, charcoal is present ever since. The level of atmospheric oxygen is closely related to the prevalence of charcoal: clearly oxygen is the key factor in the abundance of wildfire.  Fire also became more abundant when grasses radiated and became the dominant component of many ecosystems, around 6 to 7 million years ago; this kindling provided tinder which allowed for the more rapid spread of fire.  These widespread fires may have initiated a positive feedback process, whereby they produced a warmer, drier climate more conducive to fire.\\n\\n\\n== Human control ==\\n\\nThe ability to control fire was a dramatic change in the habits of early humans. Making fire to generate heat and light made it possible for people to cook food, simultaneously increasing the variety and availability of nutrients and reducing disease by killing organisms in the food. The heat produced would also help people stay warm in cold weather, enabling them to live in cooler climates. Fire also kept nocturnal predators at bay. Evidence of cooked food is found from 1 million years ago, although fire was probably not used in a controlled fashion until 400,000 years ago. There is some evidence that fire may have been used in a controlled fashion about 1 million years ago. Evidence becomes widespread around 50 to 100 thousand years ago, suggesting regular use from this time; interestingly, resistance to air pollution started to evolve in human populations at a similar point in time.  The use of fire became progressively more sophisticated, with it being used to create charcoal and to control wildlife from \\'tens of thousands\\' of years ago.Fire has also been used for centuries as a method of torture and execution, as evidenced by death by burning as well as torture devices such as the iron boot, which could be filled with water, oil, or even lead and then heated over an open fire to the agony of the wearer.\\n\\nBy the Neolithic Revolution, during the introduction of grain-based agriculture, people all over the world used fire as a tool in landscape management. These fires were typically controlled burns or \"cool fires\", as opposed to uncontrolled \"hot fires\", which damage the soil. Hot fires destroy plants and animals, and endanger communities. This is especially a problem in the forests of today where traditional burning is prevented in order to encourage the growth of timber crops. Cool fires are generally conducted in the spring and autumn. They clear undergrowth, burning up biomass that could trigger a hot fire should it get too dense. They provide a greater variety of environments, which encourages game and plant diversity. For humans, they make dense, impassable forests traversable. Another human use for fire in regards to landscape management is its use to clear land for agriculture. Slash-and-burn agriculture is still common across much of tropical Africa, Asia and South America. \"For small farmers, it is a convenient way to clear overgrown areas and release nutrients from standing vegetation back into the soil\", said Miguel Pinedo-Vasquez, an ecologist at the Earth Institute’s Center for Environmental Research and Conservation. However this useful strategy is also problematic. Growing population, fragmentation of forests and warming climate are making the earth\\'s surface more prone to ever-larger escaped fires. These harm ecosystems and human infrastructure, cause health problems, and send up spirals of carbon and soot that may encourage even more warming of the atmosphere – and thus feed back into more fires. Globally today, as much as 5 million square kilometres – an area more than half the size of the United States – burns in a given year.There are numerous modern applications of fire. In its broadest sense, fire is used by nearly every human being on earth in a controlled setting every day. Users of internal combustion vehicles employ fire every time they drive. Thermal power stations provide electricity for a large percentage of humanity.\\n\\nThe use of fire in warfare has a long history. Fire was the basis of all early thermal weapons. Homer detailed the use of fire by Greek soldiers who hid in a wooden horse to burn Troy during the Trojan war. Later the Byzantine fleet used Greek fire to attack ships and men. In the First World War, the first modern flamethrowers were used by infantry, and were successfully mounted on armoured vehicles in the Second World War. In the latter war, incendiary bombs were used by Axis and Allies alike, notably on Tokyo, Rotterdam, London, Hamburg and, notoriously, at Dresden; in the latter two cases firestorms were deliberately caused in which a ring of fire surrounding each city was drawn inward by an updraft caused by a central cluster of fires. The United States Army Air Force also extensively used incendiaries against Japanese targets in the latter months of the war, devastating entire cities constructed primarily of wood and paper houses. The use of napalm was employed in July 1944, towards the end of the Second World War; although its use did not gain public attention until the Vietnam War. Molotov cocktails were also used.\\n\\n\\n=== Use as fuel ===\\n\\nSetting fuel aflame releases usable energy. Wood was a prehistoric fuel, and is still viable today. The use of fossil fuels, such as petroleum, natural gas, and coal, in power plants supplies the vast majority of the world\\'s electricity today; the International Energy Agency states that nearly 80% of the world\\'s power came from these sources in 2002. The fire in a power station is used to heat water, creating steam that drives turbines. The turbines then spin an electric generator to produce electricity. Fire is also used to provide mechanical work directly, in both external and internal combustion engines.\\nThe unburnable solid remains of a combustible material left after a fire is called clinker if its melting point is below the flame temperature, so that it fuses and then solidifies as it cools, and ash if its melting point is above the flame temperature.\\n\\n\\n== Protection and prevention ==\\n\\nWildfire prevention programs around the world may employ techniques such as wildland fire use and prescribed or controlled burns. Wildland fire use refers to any fire of natural causes that is monitored but allowed to burn. Controlled burns are fires ignited by government agencies under less dangerous weather conditions.Fire fighting services are provided in most developed areas to extinguish or contain uncontrolled fires. Trained firefighters use fire apparatus, water supply resources such as water mains and fire hydrants or they might use A and B class foam depending on what is feeding the fire.\\nFire prevention is intended to reduce sources of ignition.  Fire prevention also includes education to teach people how to avoid causing fires. Buildings, especially schools and tall buildings, often conduct fire drills to inform and prepare citizens on how to react to a building fire. Purposely starting destructive fires constitutes arson and is a crime in most jurisdictions.Model building codes require passive fire protection and active fire protection systems to minimize damage resulting from a fire. The most common form of active fire protection is fire sprinklers. To maximize passive fire protection of buildings, building materials and furnishings in most developed countries are tested for fire-resistance, combustibility and flammability. Upholstery, carpeting and plastics used in vehicles and vessels are also tested.\\nWhere fire prevention and fire protection have failed to prevent damage, fire insurance can mitigate the financial impact.\\n\\n\\n== Restoration ==\\n\\nDifferent restoration methods and measures are used depending on the type of fire damage that occurred. Restoration after fire damage can be performed by property management teams, building maintenance personnel, or by the homeowners themselves; however, contacting a certified professional fire damage restoration specialist is often regarded as the safest way to restore fire damaged property due to their training and extensive experience. Most are usually listed under \"Fire and Water Restoration\" and they can help speed repairs, whether for individual homeowners or for the largest of institutions.Fire and Water Restoration companies are regulated by the appropriate state\\'s Department of Consumer Affairs – usually the state contractors license board. In California, all Fire and Water Restoration companies must register with the California Contractors State License Board. Presently, the California Contractors State License Board has no specific classification for \"water and fire damage restoration.\" Hence, the Contractor\\'s State License Board requires both an asbestos certification (ASB) as well as a demolition classification (C-21) in order to perform Fire and Water Restoration work.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== Notes ===\\n\\n\\n=== Citations ===\\n\\n\\n=== Sources ===\\nHaung, Kai (2009).
