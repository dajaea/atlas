{"topic": "Education", "english_title": "Education", "english": "Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.\nFormal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.\nThere are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and efficiency of education towards applicable relevance in the students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern or future society at large or for evidence-based education methodologies. A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations. Global initiatives aim at achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all. In most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nEtymologically, the word \"education\" is derived from the Latin word \u0113duc\u0101ti\u014d (\"A breeding, a bringing up, a rearing\") from \u0113duc\u014d (\"I educate, I train\") which is related to the homonym \u0113d\u016bc\u014d (\"I lead forth, I take out; I raise up, I erect\") from \u0113- (\"from, out of\") and d\u016bc\u014d (\"I lead, I conduct\").\n\n\n== History ==\n\nEducation began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom. \nPlato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe. The city of Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.In China, Confucius (551\u2013479 BCE), of the State of Lu, was the country's most influential ancient philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to influence the societies of China and neighbours like Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Confucius gathered disciples and searched in vain for a ruler who would adopt his ideals for good governance, but his Analects were written down by followers and have continued to influence education in East Asia into the modern era.The Aztecs also had a well-developed theory about education, which has an equivalent word in Nahuatl called tlacahuapahualiztli. It means \"the art of raising or educating a person\", or \"the art of strengthening or bringing up men\". This was a broad conceptualization of education, which prescribed that it begins at home, supported by formal schooling, and reinforced by community living. Historians cite that formal education was mandatory for everyone regardless of social class and gender. There was also the word neixtlamachiliztli, which is \"the act of giving wisdom to the face.\" These concepts underscore a complex set of educational practices, which was oriented towards communicating to the next generation the experience and intellectual heritage of the past for the purpose of individual development and his integration into the community.After the Fall of Rome, the Catholic Church became the sole preserver of literate scholarship in Western Europe. The church established cathedral schools in the Early Middle Ages as centres of advanced education. Some of these establishments ultimately evolved into medieval universities and forebears of many of Europe's modern universities. During the High Middle Ages, Chartres Cathedral operated the famous and influential Chartres Cathedral School. The medieval universities of Western Christendom were well-integrated across all of Western Europe, encouraged freedom of inquiry, and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers, including Thomas Aquinas of the University of Naples, Robert Grosseteste of the University of Oxford, an early expositor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation, and Saint Albert the Great, a pioneer of biological field research. Founded in 1088, the University of Bologne is considered the first, and the oldest continually operating university.Elsewhere during the Middle Ages, Islamic science and mathematics flourished under the Islamic caliphate which was established across the Middle East, extending from the Iberian Peninsula in the west to the Indus in the east and to the Almoravid Dynasty and Mali Empire in the south.\nThe Renaissance in Europe ushered in a new age of scientific and intellectual inquiry and appreciation of ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. Around 1450, Johannes Gutenberg developed a printing press, which allowed works of literature to spread more quickly. The European Age of Empires saw European ideas of education in philosophy, religion, arts and sciences spread out across the globe. Missionaries and scholars also brought back new ideas from other civilizations \u2013 as with the Jesuit China missions who played a significant role in the transmission of knowledge, science, and culture between China and Europe, translating works from Europe like Euclid's Elements for Chinese scholars and the thoughts of Confucius for European audiences. The Enlightenment saw the emergence of a more secular educational outlook in Europe. Much of modern traditional Western and Eastern education is based on the Prussian education system.In most countries today, full-time education, whether at school or otherwise, is compulsory for all children up to a certain age. Due to this the proliferation of compulsory education, combined with population growth, UNESCO has calculated that in the next 30 years more people will receive formal education than in all of human history thus far.\n\n\n== Formal ==\nFormal education occurs in a structured environment whose explicit purpose is teaching students. Usually, formal education takes place in a school environment with classrooms of multiple students learning together with a trained, certified teacher of the subject. Most school systems are designed around a set of values or ideals that govern all educational choices in that system. Such choices include curriculum, organizational models, design of the physical learning spaces (e.g. classrooms), student-teacher interactions, methods of assessment, class size, educational activities, and more.The International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) was created by UNESCO as a statistical base to compare education systems. In 1997, it defined 7 levels of education and 25 fields, though the fields were later separated out to form a different project. The current version ISCED 2011 has 9 rather than 7 levels, created by dividing the tertiary pre-doctorate level into three levels. It also extended the lowest level (ISCED 0) to cover a new sub-category of early childhood educational development programmes, which target children below the age of 3 years.\n\n\n=== Early childhood ===\n\nEducation designed to support early development in preparation for participation in school and society. The programmes are designed for children below the age of 3. This is ISCED level 01. Preschools provide education from ages approximately three to seven, depending on the country when children enter primary education. The children now readily interact with their peers and the educator. These are also known as nursery schools and as kindergarten, except in the US, where the term kindergarten refers to the earliest levels of primary education. Kindergarten \"provides a child-centred, preschool curriculum for three- to seven-year-old children that aim[s] at unfolding the child's physical, intellectual, and moral nature with balanced emphasis on each of them.\" This is ISCED level 02.\n\n\n=== Primary ===\n\nThis is ISCED level 1. Primary (or elementary) education consists of the first four to seven years of formal, structured education. In general, primary education consists of six to eight years of schooling starting at the age of five to seven, although this varies between, and sometimes within, countries. Globally, in 2008, around 89% of children aged six to twelve were enrolled in primary education, and this proportion was rising. Under the Education For All programs driven by UNESCO, most countries have committed to achieving universal enrollment in primary education by 2015, and in many countries, it is compulsory. The division between primary and secondary education is somewhat arbitrary, but it generally occurs at about eleven or twelve years of age. Some education systems have separate middle schools, with the transition to the final stage of secondary education taking place at around the age of fifteen. Schools that provide primary education, are mostly referred to as primary schools or elementary schools. Primary schools are often subdivided into infant schools and junior schools.\nIn India, for example, compulsory education spans over twelve years, with eight years of elementary education, five years of primary schooling and three years of upper primary schooling. Various states in the republic of India provide 12 years of compulsory school education based on a national curriculum framework designed by the National Council of Educational Research and Training.\n\n\n=== Secondary ===\n\nThis covers the two ISCED levels, ISCED 2: Lower Secondary Education and ISCED 3: Upper Secondary Education.In most contemporary educational systems of the world, secondary education comprises the formal education that occurs during adolescence.  In the United States, Canada, and Australia, primary and secondary education together are sometimes referred to as K-12 education, and in New Zealand Year 1\u201313 is used. The purpose of secondary education can be to give common knowledge, to prepare for higher education, or to train directly in a profession.Secondary education in the United States did not emerge until 1910, with the rise of large corporations and advancing technology in factories, which required skilled workers. In order to meet this new job demand, high schools were created, with a curriculum focused on practical job skills that would better prepare students for white collar or skilled blue collar work. This proved beneficial for both employers and employees, since the improved human capital lowered costs for the employer, while skilled employees received higher wages.Secondary education has a longer history in Europe, where grammar schools or academies date from as early as the 6th century,  in the form of public schools, fee-paying schools, or charitable educational foundations, which themselves date even further back.It spans the period between the typically universal compulsory, primary education to the optional, selective tertiary, \"postsecondary\", or \"higher\" education of ISCED 5 and 6 (e.g. university), and the ISCED 4 Further education or vocational school.\n\nDepending on the system, schools for this period, or a part of it, may be called secondary or high schools, gymnasiums, lyceums, middle schools, colleges, or vocational schools. The exact meaning of any of these terms varies from one system to another. The exact boundary between primary and secondary education also varies from country to country and even within them but is generally around the seventh to the tenth year of schooling.\n\n\n==== Lower ====\nPrograms at ISCED level 2, lower secondary education are usually organized around a more subject-oriented curriculum; differing from primary education. Teachers typically have\npedagogical training in the specific subjects and, more often than at ISCED level 1, a class of\nstudents will have several teachers, each with specialized knowledge of the subjects they teach. Programmes at ISCED level 2, aim to lay the foundation for lifelong learning and human development upon introducing theoretical concepts across a broad range of subjects which can be developed in future stages. Some education systems may offer vocational education programs during ISCED level 2 providing skills relevant to employment.\n\n\n==== Upper ====\nPrograms at ISCED level 3, or upper secondary education, are typically designed to complete the secondary education process. They lead to skills relevant to employment and the skill necessary to engage in tertiary courses. They offer students more varied, specialized and in-depth instruction. They are more differentiated, with range of options and learning streams.Community colleges offer another option at this transitional stage of education. They provide nonresidential junior college courses to people living in a particular area.\n\n\n=== Tertiary ===\n\nHigher education, also called tertiary, third stage, or postsecondary education, is the non-compulsory educational level that follows the completion of a school such as a high school or secondary school. Tertiary education is normally taken to include undergraduate and postgraduate education, as well as vocational education and training. Colleges and universities mainly provide tertiary education. Collectively, these are sometimes known as tertiary institutions. Individuals who complete tertiary education generally receive certificates, diplomas, or academic degrees.\nThe ISCED distinguishes 4 levels of tertiary education. ISCED 6 is equivalent to a first degree, ISCED 7 is equivalent to a masters or an advanced professional qualification and ISCED 8 is an advanced research qualification, usually concluding with the submission and defence of a substantive dissertation of publishable quality based on original research. The category ISCED 5 is reserved for short-cycle courses of requiring degree level study.Higher education typically involves work towards a degree-level or foundation degree qualification. In most developed countries, a high proportion of the population (up to 50%) now enter higher education at some time in their lives. Higher education is therefore very important to national economies, both as a significant industry in its own right and as a source of trained and educated personnel for the rest of the economy.\nUniversity education includes teaching, research, and social services activities, and it includes both the undergraduate level (sometimes referred to as tertiary education) and the graduate (or postgraduate) level (sometimes referred to as graduate school). Some universities are composed of several colleges.\nOne type of university education is a liberal arts education, which can be defined as a \"college or university curriculum aimed at imparting broad general knowledge and developing general intellectual capacities, in contrast to a professional, vocational, or technical curriculum.\" Although what is known today as liberal arts education began in Europe, the term \"liberal arts college\" is more commonly associated with institutions in the United States such as Williams College or Barnard College.\n\n\n=== Vocational ===\n\nVocational education is a form of education focused on direct and practical training for a specific trade or craft. Vocational education may come in the form of an apprenticeship or internship as well as institutions teaching courses such as carpentry, agriculture, engineering, medicine, architecture and the arts. Post 16 education, adult education and further education involve continued study, but a level no different from that found at upper secondary, and are grouped together as ISCED 4, post-secondary non-tertiary education.\n\n\n=== Special ===\n\nIn the past, those who were disabled were often not eligible for public education. Children with disabilities were repeatedly denied an education by physicians or special tutors.  These early physicians (people like Itard, Seguin, Howe, Gallaudet) set the foundation for special education today. They focused on individualized instruction and functional skills.  In its early years, special education was only provided to people with severe disabilities, but more recently it has been opened to anyone who has experienced difficulty learning.\n\n\n== Unconvential forms ==\n\n\n=== Alternative ===\n\nWhile considered \"alternative\" today, most alternative systems have existed since ancient times.  After the public school system was widely developed beginning in the 19th century, some parents found reasons to be discontented with the new system. Alternative education developed in part as a reaction to perceived limitations and failings of traditional education. A broad range of educational approaches emerged, including alternative schools, self learning, homeschooling, and unschooling. Example alternative schools include Montessori schools, Waldorf schools (or Steiner schools), Friends schools, Sands School, Summerhill School, Walden's Path, The Peepal Grove School, Sudbury Valley School, Krishnamurti schools, and open classroom schools.\nCharter schools are another example of alternative education, which have in the recent years grown in numbers in the US and gained greater importance in its public education system.In time, some ideas from these experiments and paradigm challenges may be adopted as the norm in education, just as Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel's approach to early childhood education in 19th-century Germany has been incorporated into contemporary kindergarten classrooms. Other influential writers and thinkers have included the Swiss humanitarian Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi; the American transcendentalists Amos Bronson Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Henry David Thoreau; the founders of progressive education, John Dewey and Francis Parker; and educational pioneers such as Maria Montessori and Rudolf Steiner, and more recently John Caldwell Holt, Paul Goodman, Frederick Mayer, George Dennison, and Ivan Illich.\n\n\n=== Indigenous ===\n\nIndigenous education refers to the inclusion of indigenous knowledge, models, methods, and content within formal and non-formal educational systems. Often in a post-colonial context, the growing recognition and use of indigenous education methods can be a response to the erosion and loss of indigenous knowledge and language through the processes of colonialism. Furthermore, it can enable indigenous communities to \"reclaim and revalue their languages and cultures, and in so doing, improve the educational success of indigenous students.\"\n\n\n=== Informal learning ===\n\nInformal learning is one of three forms of learning defined by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Informal learning occurs in a variety of places, such as at home, work, and through daily interactions and shared relationships among members of society.  For many learners, this includes language acquisition, cultural norms, and manners.\n\nIn informal learning, there is often a reference person, a peer or expert, to guide the learner.  If learners have a personal interest in what they are informally being taught, learners tend to expand their existing knowledge and conceive new ideas about the topic being learned. For example, a museum is traditionally considered an informal learning environment, as there is room for free choice, a diverse and potentially non-standardized range of topics, flexible structures, socially rich interaction, and no externally imposed assessments.While informal learning often takes place outside educational establishments and does not follow a specified curriculum, it can also occur within educational settings and even during formal learning situations. Educators can structure their lessons to directly utilize their students informal learning skills within the education setting.In the late 19th century, education through play began to be recognized as making an important contribution to child development. In the early 20th century, the concept was broadened to include young adults but the emphasis was on physical activities. L.P. Jacks, also an early proponent of lifelong learning, described education through recreation: \"A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play, his labour and his leisure, his mind and his body, his education and his recreation. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. To himself, he always seems to be doing both. Enough for him that he does it well.\" Education through recreation is the opportunity to learn in a seamless fashion through all of life's activities. The concept has been revived by the University of Western Ontario to teach anatomy to medical students.\n\n\n=== Self-directed learning ===\n\nAutodidacticism (also autodidactism) is self-directed learning. One may become an autodidact at nearly any point in one's life. Notable autodidacts include Abraham Lincoln (U.S. president), Srinivasa Ramanujan (mathematician), Michael Faraday (chemist and physicist), Charles Darwin (naturalist), Thomas Alva Edison (inventor), Tadao Ando (architect), George Bernard Shaw (playwright), Frank Zappa (composer, recording engineer, film director), and Leonardo da Vinci (engineer, scientist, mathematician).\n\n\n=== Evidence-based ===\n\nEvidence-based education is the use of well designed scientific studies to determine which education methods work best. It consists of evidence-based teaching and evidence-based learning. Evidence-based learning methods such as spaced repetition can increase rate of learning. The evidence-based education movement has its roots in the larger movement towards evidence-based-practices.\n\n\n=== Open learning and electronic technology ===\n\nMany large university institutions are now starting to offer free or almost free full courses, through open education, such as Harvard, MIT and Berkeley teaming up to form edX. Other universities offering open education are prestigious private universities such as Stanford, Princeton, Duke, Johns Hopkins, the University of Pennsylvania, and Caltech, as well as notable public universities including Tsinghua, Peking, Edinburgh, University of Michigan, and University of Virginia.\nOpen education has been called the biggest change in the way people learn since the printing press. Despite favourable studies on effectiveness, many people may still desire to choose traditional campus education for social and cultural reasons.Many open universities are working to have the ability to offer students standardized testing and traditional degrees and credentials.The conventional merit-system degree is currently not as common in open education as it is in campus universities, although some open universities do already offer conventional degrees such as the Open University in the United Kingdom. Presently, many of the major open education sources offer their own form of certificate.\nOut of 182 colleges surveyed in 2009 nearly half said tuition for online courses was higher than for campus-based ones.A 2010 meta-analysis found that online and blended educational approaches had better outcomes than methods that used solely face-to-face interaction.\n\n\n== Public schooling ==\n\nThe education sector or education system is a group of institutions (ministries of education, local educational authorities, teacher training institutions, schools, universities, etc.) whose primary purpose is to provide education to children and young people in educational settings. It involves a wide range of people (curriculum developers, inspectors, school principals, teachers, school nurses, students, etc.). These institutions can vary according to different contexts.Schools deliver education, with support from the rest of the education system through various elements such as education policies and guidelines \u2013 to which school policies can refer \u2013 curricula and learning materials, as well as pre- and in-service teacher training programmes. The school environment \u2013 both physical (infrastructures) and psychological (school climate) \u2013 is also guided by school policies that should ensure the well-being of students when they are in school. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has found that schools tend to perform best when principals have full authority and responsibility for ensuring that students are proficient in core subjects upon graduation. They must also seek feedback from students for quality-assurance and improvement. Governments should limit themselves to monitoring student proficiency.The education sector is fully integrated into society, through interactions with numerous stakeholders and other sectors. These include parents, local communities, religious leaders, NGOs, stakeholders involved in health, child protection, justice and law enforcement (police), media and political leadership.The shape, methodologies, taught material \u2013 the curriculum \u2013 of formal education is decided by political decision makers along with federal agencies such as the state education agency in the United States.\n\n\n== Development goals ==\n\nJoseph Chimombo pointed out education's role as a policy instrument, capable of instilling social change and economic advancement in developing countries by giving communities the opportunity to take control of their destinies. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in September 2015, calls for a new vision to address the environmental, social and economic concerns facing the world today. The Agenda includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 4 on education.Since 1909, the percentage of children in the developing world attending school has increased. Before then, a small minority of boys attended school. By the start of the twenty-first century, the majority of children in most regions of the world attended school.Universal Primary Education was one of the eight international Millennium Development Goals, towards which progress has been made in the past decade, though barriers still remain. Securing charitable funding from prospective donors is one particularly persistent problem. Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute have indicated that the main obstacles to funding for education include conflicting donor priorities, an immature aid architecture, and a lack of evidence and advocacy for the issue. Additionally, Transparency International has identified corruption in the education sector as a major stumbling block to achieving Universal Primary Education in Africa. Furthermore, demand in the developing world for improved educational access is not as high as foreigners have expected. Indigenous governments are reluctant to take on the ongoing costs involved. There is also economic pressure from some parents, who prefer their children to earn money in the short term rather than work towards the long-term benefits of education.A study conducted by the UNESCO International Institute for Educational Planning indicates that stronger capacities in educational planning and management may have an important spill-over effect on the system as a whole. Sustainable capacity development requires complex interventions at the institutional, organizational and individual levels that could be based on some foundational principles:\nnational leadership and ownership should be the touchstone of any intervention;\nstrategies must be context relevant and context specific;\nplans should employ an integrated set of complementary interventions, though implementation may need to proceed in steps;\npartners should commit to a long-term investment in capacity development while working towards some short-term achievements;\noutside intervention should be conditional on an impact assessment of national capacities at various levels;\na certain percentage of students should be removed for improvisation of academics (usually practiced in schools, after 10th grade).\n\n\n=== Internationalisation ===\nNearly every country now has universal primary education.\nSimilarities \u2013 in systems or even in ideas \u2013 that schools share internationally have led to an increase in international student exchanges. The European Socrates-Erasmus Programme facilitates exchanges across European universities. The Soros Foundation provides many opportunities for students from central Asia and eastern Europe. Programs such as the International Baccalaureate have contributed to the internationalization of education. The global campus online, led by American universities, allows free access to class materials and lecture files recorded during the actual classes.\nThe Programme for International Student Assessment and the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement objectively monitor and compare the proficiency of students from a wide range of different nations.\nThe internationalization of education is sometimes equated by critics with the westernization of education. These critics say that the internationalization of education leads to the erosion of local education systems and indigenous values and norms, which are replaced with Western systems and cultural and ideological values and orientation.\n\n\n=== Technology in developing countries ===\n\nTechnology plays an increasingly significant role in improving access to education for people living in impoverished areas and developing countries. However, lack of technological advancement is still causing barriers with regards to quality and access to education in developing countries. Charities like One Laptop per Child are dedicated to providing infrastructures through which the disadvantaged may access educational materials.\nThe OLPC foundation, a group out of MIT Media Lab and supported by several major corporations, has a stated mission to develop a $100 laptop for delivering educational software. The laptops were widely available as of 2008. They are sold at cost or given away based on donations.In Africa, the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) has launched an \"e-school program\" to provide all 600,000 primary and high schools with computer equipment, learning materials and internet access within 10 years. An International Development Agency project called nabuur.com, started with the support of former American President Bill Clinton, uses the Internet to allow co-operation by individuals on issues of social development.\nIndia is developing technologies that will bypass land-based telephone and Internet infrastructure to deliver distance learning directly to its students. In 2004, the Indian Space Research Organisation launched EDUSAT, a communications satellite providing access to educational materials that can reach more of the country's population at a greatly reduced cost.\n\n\n=== Funding in developing countries ===\nA survey of literature of the research into low-cost private schools (LCPS) found that over 5-year period to July 2013, debate around LCPSs to achieving Education for All (EFA) objectives was polarized and finding growing coverage in international policy. The polarization was due to disputes around whether the schools are affordable for the poor, reach disadvantaged groups, provide quality education, support or undermine equality, and are financially sustainable. The report examined the main challenges encountered by development organizations which support LCPSs. Surveys suggest these types of schools are expanding across Africa and Asia. This success is attributed to excess demand. These surveys found concern for:\n\nEquity: This concern is widely found in the literature, suggesting the growth in low-cost private schooling may be exacerbating or perpetuating already existing inequalities in developing countries, between urban and rural populations, lower- and higher-income families, and between girls and boys. The report findings suggest that girls may be under represented and that LCPS are reaching low-income families in smaller numbers than higher-income families.\nQuality and educational outcomes: It is difficult to generalize about the quality of private schools. While most achieve better results than government counterparts, even after their social background is taken into account, some studies find the opposite. Quality in terms of levels of teacher absence, teaching activity, and pupil to teacher ratios in some countries are better in LCPSs than in government schools.\nChoice and affordability for the poor: Parents can choose private schools because of perceptions of better-quality teaching and facilities, and an English language instruction preference. Nevertheless, the concept of 'choice' does not apply in all contexts, or to all groups in society, partly because of limited affordability (which excludes most of the poorest) and other forms of exclusion, related to caste or social status.\nCost-effectiveness and financial sustainability: There is evidence that private schools operate at low cost by keeping teacher salaries low, and their financial situation may be precarious where they are reliant on fees from low-income households.The report showed some cases of successful voucher where there was an oversupply of quality private places and an efficient administrative authority and of subsidy programs. Evaluations of the effectiveness of international support to the sector are rare. Addressing regulatory ineffectiveness is a key challenge. Emerging approaches stress the importance of understanding the political economy of the market for LCPS, specifically how relationships of power and accountability between users, government, and private providers can produce better education outcomes for the poor.\n\n\n== Theory ==\n\n\n=== Psychology ===\n\nEducational psychology is the study of how humans learn in educational settings, the effectiveness of educational interventions, the psychology of teaching, and the social psychology of schools as organizations. The terms \"educational psychology\" and \"school psychology\" are often used interchangeably. Educational psychology is concerned with the processes of educational attainment in the general population and in sub-populations such as gifted children and those with specific disabilities.\n\nEducational psychology can in part be understood through its relationship with other disciplines. It is informed primarily by psychology, bearing a relationship to that discipline analogous to the relationship between medicine and biology. Educational psychology, in turn, informs a wide range of specialties within educational studies, including instructional design, educational technology, curriculum development, organizational learning, special education and classroom management. Educational psychology both draws from and contributes to cognitive science and the learning sciences. In universities, departments of educational psychology are usually housed within faculties of education, possibly accounting for the lack of representation of educational psychology content in introductory psychology textbooks (Lucas, Blazek, & Raley, 2006).\n\n\n==== Intelligence ====\n\nIntelligence is an important factor in how the individual responds to education. Those who have higher scores of intelligence-metrics tend to perform better at school and go on to higher levels of education. This effect is also observable in the opposite direction, in that education increases measurable intelligence. Studies have shown that while educational attainment is important in predicting intelligence in later life, intelligence at 53 is more closely correlated to intelligence at 8 years old than to educational attainment.\n\n\n=== Learning modalities ===\n\nThere has been much interest in learning modalities and styles over the last two decades. The most commonly employed learning modalities are:\nVisual: learning based on observation and seeing what is being learned.\nAuditory: learning based on listening to instructions/information.\nKinesthetic: learning based on movement, e.g. hands-on work and engaging in activities.Other commonly employed modalities include musical, interpersonal, verbal, logical, and intrapersonal.\nDunn and Dunn focused on identifying relevant stimuli that may influence learning and manipulating the school environment, at about the same time as Joseph Renzulli recommended varying teaching strategies. Howard Gardner identified a wide range of modalities in his Multiple Intelligences theories. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and Keirsey Temperament Sorter, based on the works of Jung, focus on understanding how people's personality affects the way they interact personally, and how this affects the way individuals respond to each other within the learning environment. The work of David Kolb and Anthony Gregorc's Type Delineator follows a similar but more simplified approach.\nSome theories propose that all individuals benefit from a variety of learning modalities, while others suggest that individuals may have preferred learning styles, learning more easily through visual or kinesthetic experiences. A consequence of the latter theory is that effective teaching should present a variety of teaching methods which cover all three learning modalities so that different students have equal opportunities to learn in a way that is effective for them. Guy Claxton has questioned the extent that learning styles such as Visual, Auditory and Kinesthetic(VAK) are helpful, particularly as they can have a tendency to label children and therefore restrict learning. Recent research has argued, \"there is no adequate evidence base to justify incorporating learning styles assessments into general educational practice.\"\n\n\n=== Mind, brain, and education ===\nEducational neuroscience is an emerging scientific field that brings together researchers in cognitive neuroscience, developmental cognitive neuroscience, educational psychology, educational technology, education theory and other related disciplines to explore the interactions between biological processes and education. Researchers in educational neuroscience investigate the neural mechanisms of reading, numerical cognition, attention, and their attendant difficulties including dyslexia, dyscalculia, and ADHD as they relate to education. Several academic institutions around the world are beginning to devote resources to the establishment of educational neuroscience research.\n\n\n=== Philosophy ===\n\nAs an academic field, philosophy of education is \"the philosophical study of education and its problems its central subject matter is education, and its methods are those of philosophy\". \"The philosophy of education may be either the philosophy of the process of education or the philosophy of the discipline of education. That is, it may be part of the discipline in the sense of being concerned with the aims, forms, methods, or results of the process of educating or being educated; or it may be metadisciplinary in the sense of being concerned with the concepts, aims, and methods of the discipline.\" As such, it is both part of the field of education and a field of applied philosophy, drawing from fields of metaphysics, epistemology, axiology and the philosophical approaches (speculative, prescriptive or analytic) to address questions in and about pedagogy, education policy, and curriculum, as well as the process of learning, to name a few. For example, it might study what constitutes upbringing and education, the values and norms revealed through upbringing and educational practices, the limits and legitimization of education as an academic discipline, and the relation between education theory and practice.\n\n\n=== Purpose ===\nThere is no broad consensus as to what education's chief aim or aims are or should be. Different places, and at different times, have used educational systems for different purposes.  The Prussian education system in the 19th century, for example, wanted to turn boys and girls into adults who would serve the state's political goals.Some authors stress its value to the individual, emphasizing its potential for positively influencing students' personal development, promoting autonomy, forming a cultural identity or establishing a career or occupation. Other authors emphasize education's contributions to societal purposes, including good citizenship, shaping students into productive members of society, thereby promoting society's general economic development, and preserving cultural values.The purpose of education in a given time and place affects who is taught, what is taught, and how the education system behaves.  For example, in the 21st century, many countries treat education as a positional good. In this competitive approach, people want their own students to get a better education than other students. This approach can lead to unfair treatment of some students, especially those from disadvantaged or marginalized groups. For example, in this system, a city's school system may draw school district boundaries so that nearly all the students in one school are from low-income families, and that nearly all the students in the neighboring schools come from more affluent families, even though concentrating low-income students in one school results in worse educational achievement for the entire school system.\n\n\n=== Curriculum ===\n\nIn formal education, a curriculum is the set of courses and their content offered at a school or university. As an idea, curriculum stems from the Latin word for race course, referring to the course of deeds and experiences through which children grow to become mature adults. A curriculum is prescriptive and is based on a more general syllabus which merely specifies what topics must be understood and to what level to achieve a particular grade or standard.\nAn academic discipline is a branch of knowledge which is formally taught, either at the university \u2013 or via some other such method. Each discipline usually has several sub-disciplines or branches, and distinguishing lines are often both arbitrary and ambiguous. Examples of broad areas of academic disciplines include the natural sciences, mathematics, computer science, social sciences, humanities and applied sciences.\n\n\n=== Instruction ===\nInstruction is the facilitation of another's learning. Instructors in primary and secondary institutions are often called teachers, and they direct the education of students and might draw on many subjects like reading, writing, mathematics, science and history. Instructors in post-secondary institutions might be called teachers, instructors, or professors, depending on the type of institution; and they primarily teach only their specific discipline. Studiesfrom the United States suggest that the quality of teachers is the single most important factor affecting student performance, and that countries which score highly on international tests have multiple policies in place to ensure that the teachers they employ are as effective as possible. With the passing of NCLB in the United States (No Child Left Behind), teachers must be highly qualified.\n\n\n== Economics ==\n\nIt has been argued that high rates of education are essential for countries to be able to achieve high levels of economic growth. Empirical analyses tend to support the theoretical prediction that poor countries should grow faster than rich countries because they can adopt cutting-edge technologies already tried and tested by rich countries. However, technology transfer requires knowledgeable managers and engineers who are able to operate new machines or production practices borrowed from the leader in order to close the gap through imitation. Therefore, a country's ability to learn from the leader is a function of its stock of \"human capital\". Recent study of the determinants of aggregate economic growth have stressed the importance of fundamental economic institutions and the role of cognitive skills.At the level of the individual, there is a large literature, generally related to the work of Jacob Mincer, on how earnings are related to the schooling and other human capital. This work has motivated many studies, but is also controversial. The chief controversies revolve around how to interpret the impact of schooling. Some students who have indicated a high potential for learning, by testing with a high intelligence quotient, may not achieve their full academic potential, due to financial difficulties.Economists Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis argued in 1976 that there was a fundamental conflict in American schooling between the egalitarian goal of democratic participation and the inequalities implied by the continued profitability of capitalist production.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nThe world is changing at an ever quickening rate, which means that a lot of knowledge becomes obsolete and inaccurate more quickly. The emphasis is therefore shifting to teaching the skills of learning: to picking up new knowledge quickly and in as agile a way as possible. Finnish schools have begun to move away from the regular subject-focused curricula, introducing instead developments like phenomenon-based learning, where students study concepts like climate change instead. There are also active educational interventions to implement programs and paths specific to non-traditional students, such as first generation students.\nEducation is also becoming a commodity no longer reserved for children; adults need it too. Some governmental bodies, like the Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra in Finland, have proposed compulsory lifelong education.Studies found that automation is likely to eliminate nearly half the jobs in developed countries during roughly the next two decades. Automation is therefore considered to be a major factor in a \"race between education and technology\". Automation technologies and their application may render certain currently taught skills and knowledge redundant while increasing the need for other curricula \u2013 such as material related to the application of automation. It has been argued that formal education is \"teaching workers the wrong things, and that deep reform is essential to facilitate the development of digital knowledge and technical skills, as well as nonroutine cognitive and noncognitive (or \"soft\") skills\" and that the formal state-organized education system \u2013 which is built on the Industrial Revolution model and focuses on IQ and memorization is losing relevance. Furthermore, it has been argued that with contemporary education policy creativity is restricted, inquiry-based learning is not facilitated, education is not meeting the needs of knowledge economies and is largely not personalized to the students. Schools were found rarely teach in forms of \"learning by doing\", and many children above a certain age \"hate school\" in terms of the material and subjects being taught, with much of it being a \"waste of time\" that gets forgotten quickly and is useless in modern society. Moreover, the material currently being taught may not be taught in a highly time-efficient manner and analyzing educational issues over time and using relevant forms of student feedback in efficiency analysis were found to be important. Some research investigates how education can facilitate students' interest in topics \u2013 and jobs \u2013 that scientific research, data, economic players, financial markets, and other economic mechanisms consider important to contemporary and future human civilization and states.Research and data indicate future environmental conditions will be \"far more dangerous than currently believed\", with a review concluding that the current challenges that humanity faces are enormous. The effective resolval of such challenges may require novel lesson plans tailored towards skills and knowledge found to be both required and reasonable to be taught at the respective age with the respective methodology despite novel technological computation and information retrieval technologies such as smartphones, mathematical software and the World Wide Web. Environmental education is not widely taught extensively or facilitated while being potentially important to the protection and generation of \u2013 often unquantified \u2013 economic value such as clean air that agents of the economy can breathe. Education is often considered to be a national investment which may not always optimize for cost-efficiency while optimizing only in terms of contemporary economic value metrics or evaluations such as of finance and GDP without consideration of economic values or priorizations beyond these tools such as minimized marine pollution and maximized climate change mitigation. Researchers found that there is a growing disconnect between humans and nature and that schools \"are not properly preparing students to become the scientists of tomorrow\". They also find that critical thought, social responsibility, health and safety are often neglected. According to UNESCO, \"for a country to meet the basic needs of its people, the teaching of science is a strategic imperative\".One example of a skill not commonly taught in formal education systems around the world but increasingly critical to both the individuals' lives and modern society at large is digital media literacy \u2013 the ability to access, analyze, evaluate, create, and act using all forms of modern ICTs, with scientists calling for inclusion of it in curricula as well as for adult education.Studies have shown that active learning rarely applied in schools is highly efficacious. Studies found that massive open online courses offer a pathway to employment that currently bypasses conventional universities and their degree programs while often being more relevant to contemporary economic activities and the students' interests. Such online courses are not commonly part of formal education but are typically both completed and selected entirely on behalf of the student, sometimes with the support of peers over online forums. In contrast, blended learning merges online education with forms of face\u2010to\u2010face communication and traditional class-based education in classrooms, revealing itself to have the general capacity for increasingly relevant, resource-efficient and effective approaches to education. Deploying, using, and managing various tools or platforms for education typically imply an increase in economic investment. Expenses for education are often large with many calling for further increases. Potential policies for the development of international open source \u2013 and therefore noncommercial \u2013 educational software using latest technologies may minimize costs, hardware requirements, problem-resolval efforts and deployment-times while increasing robustness, security and functional features of the software.\n\n\n=== COVID-19 pandemic ===\n\nBeginning in early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted education systems throughout the world, affecting nearly 1.6 billion learners in more than 190 countries. Closures of schools and other learning spaces have impacted 94 percent of the world's student population, up to 99 percent in low and lower-middle income countries. Many schools made alternative plans during the pandemic, leading to a variety of in-person, hybrid, and online-only plans, which led to challenges for many students, teachers, and families including children with learning disabilities and those learning in a language that is not their native one. As of September 30, 2020 there were 27 countries that had localized school closures. In the United States, an estimated 55.1 million students were forced to cease in-person instruction as of April 10, 2020. A switch to a virtual learning experience is particularly challenging for families that cannot afford the proper technology, such as laptops, printers, or a reliable Internet connection. When schools close, parents are often asked to facilitate the learning of children at home and can struggle to perform this task. This is especially true for parents with limited education and resources. Students who require special education found it difficult to progress through the curriculum without tools and support that they require. Polling suggests that schools that serve a majority of students of color are far less likely to have access to the technology needed for remote learning. Only 66% of Black households in the U.S. had home broadband service in 2019. Only 45% of Black Americans owned a desktop or laptop computer in 2015. Without access to the internet or a computer, Black parents are at a disadvantage in educating their children. The mental health of students has been greatly impacted due to the pandemic. It is estimated that three in ten participating in school at home have had their emotional and mental health negatively impacted. Similarly, the social lives of students have also been upended and this has been detrimental to the health of students worldwide which has also negatively impacted educational quality. This will be an issue for years to come. COVID-19 has shone a light on opportunity gaps and it will be up to educators and policymakers to direct the necessary resources to mitigating them in the coming years.\n\n\n== See also ==\nEducation for Justice\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\nAttribution This article incorporates text from a free content work.

Generalized education generally refers to all social practice activities of human civilization, namely knowledge, skills and social life experience, to promote individual socialization and social personalized social practice, which is produced in the initial stage of human society; narrow educational specialization school Education, institutional education. Generalized education includes all aspects of social treatments, such as tutoring, etiquette and other civilization and society education.\nIn school education, teachers directly teach a series of courses, including reading, writing, mathematics, science, history, etc. In the opposite place, only a single professional skills in vocational education. In addition, people can also obtain informal education from other channels, such as museums, libraries, internet, and experience in life. Some new education methods have gradually emerged.\nToday, the right to education has been widely considered to be a basic human rights, and the European Human Rights Convention published in 1952 and the International Convention on the International Convention on the Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of the United Nations in 1966.\n\n\n== Name and word source ==\n\nThe educational process begins to be born and lasts for life has been widely accepted. Some people even believe that education can begin earlier, some parents let the fetus in the uterus listen to music and stories, and hope to have an impact on the development of children.\nThe English vocabulary of \"Education\" is eDucate or education from Latin \u0113duc\u0101ti\u014d, meaning \"lead\".\nEducation has many functions:\n\nGuarantee the function of human development and promoting human development;\nPromote the function of social development;\nSelect the function. In addition, society selection talents according to the level of education; people have achieved social status through education. Education is accompanied by the generation of human society, and with the development of society, it has always been a total of human society. The definition of education is different. For example, Dewey in the United States said: \"Education is life.\" Spencer in the UK said: \"Education is prepared for future life.\" Or more specifically regards school education as an enlightenment, participating in democratic elections (Michelli) & Keiser, 2005).\n\n\n=== Chinese meaning ===\nThe words \"education\" in Chinese are all meaning, \"teaching\" the word from the \u6534 (p\u016b) from filial piety, \u6534 is the shape, filial piety is also a part. \"\u6534\" of the staggeis is used to use a stick or a whip. \"Education\" word in the oracle shape like a woman. The word \"mother\" and the decoration on the head are under the \"child\" word. From the beginning of the Chinese character, education is a mandatory, guiding, making people in line with social norms.\n\n\n== Education system ==\nThe teaching system includes a programming teaching that follows or according to the schedule, which is usually established in the education system, which establishes certain presets. The educational system is usually related to gender, religion, etc., depending on the mental occupation of the educated people.\n\n\n=== Courses and standard education ===\n\nIn formal education, the course is a series of systems provided by a school or university, a complete course and content arrangement. Some of the educated people have implemented certain social purposes by completing certain courses. For example, children can train them for a mature person. The course is normative or relatively random, which is usually based on a more detailed syllabus, including some topics and knowledge points that need to be mastered, as well as the results or standards required to get a certain level.\nA subject is usually a knowledge of a class, or through college education or other methods. A subject usually includes some sub-disciplines or branches, which are often very strict, such as natural science, mathematics, computer science, social science, human science and application science. Among the secondary education in some countries, education units often provide some courses that meet the university standards as an elective, such as music, dance or opera.\n\n\n=== Pre-school education ===\n\nPre-school education refers to school or institutions that provide education that are not full of school-age, usually the preschool education.\nPre-school education can provide a child to contact the competitive social and educational environment as early as possible. Children learn to learn some letters, numbers, colors and paintings through pre-school education, and often lead the same age and have not been academically educated when starting standard education. But real preschool education should be to provide children-centric, purpose is to expand children's intelligence and their potential.\n\n\n=== First education ===\n\nPrimary education usually includes regular education for the first five or seven years of educators. In general, primary education usually begins with educators or six years old, which is often related to their national regulations. According to UNESCO statistics, the global 89% aged children are undergoing primary education, and this ratio has a rise. Under its \"National Education\" project, most countries have completed all the achievements of the first education. In some countries, such as: the Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China, the primary education is stipulated as an obligatory education.\nThe agency that provides such primary education is widely referred to as \"primary school\". In some countries, the primary education school will also be divided into kindergarten and primary school.\n\n\n=== Middle education ===\n\nIn most modern educational systems, secondary education includes formal education across educated in adolescents. It is treated as a period of conventional obligational primary education, to the conversion period of competitive higher education or skill education. Based on this education system, institutions engaged in secondary education include ordinary middle schools, primary middle schools, senior high schools, vocational schools. This difference is also distinguishing due to the difference in country, usually includes a stage of seventh grade to the twelfth grade. In the US, Canada and Australia's education system, secondary education and primary education usually collect \"K-12\". The purpose of secondary education is to provide general education to help educators laid the foundation for higher education, or have a purposeful culture to a certain major.\nSecondary education has continued to rise in the United States in 1910, which is largely affected by the economy and the requirements of the factory on skill workers. In order to meet the needs of such jobs, all localities have established a secondary school, and their syllabus often focused on the training of work skills to help them better raise the work requirements of white-collar workers or technical blue-collar workers. This has benefited the employer and the employer that helps the employer to increase efficiency and reduce the cost of the employer. In Europe, the popularity of secondary education is more born with ideas such as civic education. China has introduced the concept of secondary education in China with the end of the Qing Dynasty. In some countries, secondary education is still considered a mandatory compulsory education, although it has been impacted by the educational concept of independent learning.\n\n\n=== Specialized education or technical education ===\n\nSpecialized education refers to training education for direct or professional training for a certain need or field, such as computer specialist schools. Specialist education is usually accompanied by training, internship, etc., which typically includes craftsmanship, agronomical, mechanical engineering, drugs, buildings, computers or arts to cultivate talents adapt to different markets.\n\n\n=== Education reform ===\n\nWith the social change, since the late 20th century, the global multinational implementation of education reforms, in addition to the traditional discipline knowledge, it has also begun to pay attention to the skills of the 21st century.\n\n\n== Other education form ==\n\n\n=== Alternative education ===\n\nSome parents will choose another kind of education from non-mainstream schools, such as democratic schools.\n\n\n=== Self-study at home ===\n\nSome governments regard the only legal model for education as an obligatory education, but there are also some government to allow parents to arrange their children.\n\n\n== History of education ==\n\nIn 1994, Dieter Lenzen, Berlin, said: education can be said to be from hundreds of years ago, or it can be said to establish education from the end of the 1870s (Harpes, Germany, starting to establish education in the late 1870s. Director, start, and Lenzen also believes that it is difficult for scientific education to distinguish between many years of traditional education.\n\n\n=== Europe ===\nIn the West, the origin of education is affected by religious organizations: the praughters recognize the importance of education and establish a school system. In Europe, many initial universities have Catholic background. The new National Scottish church has been established after the Scottish religion reform.\n\n\n=== China ===\n\nChina's education can be traced back to Xia Dynasty and began in Chinese classical books, rather than religious organizations. The Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty was a hundred, and after the exclusive Confucianism, the Confucian classic became the main professor and learning direction of China's education. Ancient China was used to manage the empire after the various selection system, and the subsequent schools used to select officials, and they were established in the Sui Dynasty. After the Tang Dynasty, the Wu Dynasty, the five generations of Ten countries to the Song Dynasty, the Song Dynasty. In the Song Dynasty, the education of the Song Dynasty, Su Shi said in \"Xie Fang She was in the\" Xie Huishe, \"said the pen, ten rooms and nine\". \"\u5730 \u7eaa\" records the \"family music teaching, five steps, ten steps, and the peer\" in the Song Dynasty. When there are inside and outside the Southern Song Dynasty, there are civil and military two studies, relictional, Beijing-based, county, and the rest of the township schools, home, split, books, every miles must have two. The voice of our Laoxiao, often heard \". Ye Shi said: \"Today, Wu, Yue, Fu, Yu, home can have a book, know the book,\" until the end of the Qing Dynasty was officially abolished in 1905, and replaced with Western education.\n\n\n=== Japan ===\nThe origin of Japanese education is closely related to religion. The school is a temple that cultivates the young people who want to study Buddhism become monks. Later, children who want to learn will go to \"Tera-Koya, intention to temple huts), learn how to read Japanese.\n\n\n=== Recent world education trend ===\nIn the past few decades, the percentage of illiterate populations that were not subject to any school education fell. From 1960, 36% fell to 25% in 2000.\nIn developing countries, the percentage percentage of 2000 is only half of 1970. In developed countries, illiteracy also fell from 6% to 1%, and did not fall from 5% to 2% from school educators.\n\n\n== Education challenge ==\n\n\n=== Developed country ===\n\n\n=== Developing countries ===\nPrivate organizations, such as the Saint Church in the late Jesus Christ, is working to make individuals who have received more education through the Perpetual Education Fund.\n\n\n=== Campus violence ===\n\nBecause of the confiscation of mobile phones, the national three students wounded to the organism group, the relevant violence presents the actual position of the teacher in education, and it is impossible to ensure the personal safety.\n\n\n== School ==\n\nThe school is a place in accordance with certain procedures, have certain places and time, specializing in educating a particular object of the people, teaching knowledge and value systems.\n\n\n=== Parental participation ===\nParents involved in children's education is considered necessary.\n\n\n== Famous educator ==\n\nSarvapalli Radhakrishnan (SARVAPALLI RADHAKRISHNAN)\nMortimer J.
