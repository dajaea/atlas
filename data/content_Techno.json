{"topic": "Techno", "english_title": "Techno", "english": "Techno is a genre of electronic dance music (EDM) that is predominantly characterized by a repetitive four on the floor beat which is generally produced for use in a continuous DJ set. The central rhythm is often in common time (4/4), while the tempo typically varies between 120 and 150 beats per minute (bpm). Artists may use electronic instruments such as drum machines, sequencers, and synthesizers, as well as digital audio workstations. Drum machines from the 1980s such as Roland's TR-808 and TR-909 are highly prized, and software emulations of such retro instruments are popular.\nUse of the term \"techno\" to refer to a type of electronic music originated in Germany in the early 1980s. In 1988, following the UK release of the compilation Techno! The New Dance Sound of Detroit, the term came to be associated with a form of electronic dance music produced in Detroit. Detroit techno resulted from the melding of synthpop by artists such as Kraftwerk, Giorgio Moroder and Yellow Magic Orchestra with African American styles such as house, electro, and funk. Added to this is the influence of futuristic and science-fiction themes relevant to life in American late capitalist society, with Alvin Toffler's book The Third Wave a notable point of reference. The music produced in the mid to late 1980s by Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson (collectively known as the Belleville Three), along with Eddie Fowlkes, Blake Baxter, James Pennington and others is viewed as the first wave of techno from Detroit.After the success of house music in a number of European countries, techno grew in popularity in the UK, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. In Europe regional variants quickly evolved and by the early 1990s techno subgenres such as acid, hardcore, ambient, and dub techno had developed. Music journalists and fans of techno are generally selective in their use of the term; so a clear distinction can be made between sometimes related but often qualitatively different styles, such as tech house and trance.\n\n\n== Detroit techno ==\n\nIn exploring Detroit techno's origins writer Kodwo Eshun maintains that \"Kraftwerk are to techno what Muddy Waters is to the Rolling Stones: the authentic, the origin, the real.\" Juan Atkins has acknowledged that he had an early enthusiasm for Kraftwerk and Giorgio Moroder, particularly Moroder's work with Donna Summer and the producer's own album E=MC2. Atkins also mentions that \"around 1980 I had a tape of nothing but Kraftwerk, Telex, Devo, Giorgio Moroder and Gary Numan, and I'd ride around in my car playing it.\" Atkins has also claimed he was unaware of Kraftwerk's music prior to his collaboration with Richard \"3070\" Davis as Cybotron, which was two years after he had first started experimenting with electronic instruments. Regarding his initial impression of Kraftwerk, Atkins notes that they were \"clean and precise\" relative to the \"weird UFO sounds\" featured in his seemingly \"psychedelic\" music.Derrick May identified the influence of Kraftwerk and other European synthesizer music in commenting that \"it was just classy and clean, and to us it was beautiful, like outer space. Living around Detroit, there was so little beauty... everything is an ugly mess in Detroit, and so we were attracted to this music. It, like, ignited our imagination!\". May has commented that he considered his music a direct continuation of the European synthesizer tradition. He also identified Japanese synthpop act Yellow Magic Orchestra, particularly member Ryuichi Sakamoto, and British band Ultravox, as influences, along with Kraftwerk. YMO's song \"Technopolis\" (1979), a tribute to Tokyo as an electronic mecca, is considered an \"interesting contribution\" to the development of Detroit techno, foreshadowing concepts that Atkins and Davis would later explore with Cybotron.Kevin Saunderson has also acknowledged the influence of Europe but he claims to have been more inspired by the idea of making music with electronic equipment: \"I was more infatuated with the idea that I can do this all myself.\"These early Detroit techno artists additionally employed science fiction imagery to articulate their visions of a transformed society.\n\n\n=== School days ===\nPrior to achieving notoriety, Atkins, Saunderson, May, and Fowlkes shared common interests as budding musicians, \"mix\" tape traders, and aspiring DJs. They also found musical inspiration via the Midnight Funk Association, an eclectic five-hour late-night radio program hosted on various Detroit radio stations, including WCHB, WGPR, and WJLB-FM from 1977 through the mid-1980s by DJ Charles \"The Electrifying Mojo\" Johnson. Mojo's show featured electronic music by artists such as Giorgio Moroder, Kraftwerk, Yellow Magic Orchestra and Tangerine Dream, alongside the funk sounds of acts such as Parliament Funkadelic and dance oriented new wave music by bands like Devo and the B-52's. Atkins has noted:\n\nHe [Mojo] played all the Parliament and Funkadelic that anybody ever wanted to hear. Those two groups were really big in Detroit at the time. In fact, they were one of the main reasons why disco didn't really grab hold in Detroit in '79. Mojo used to play a lot of funk just to be different from all the other stations that had gone over to disco. When 'Knee Deep' came out, that just put the last nail in the coffin of disco music.\nDespite the short-lived disco boom in Detroit, it had the effect of inspiring many individuals to take up mixing, Juan Atkins among them. Subsequently, Atkins taught May how to mix records, and in 1981, \"Magic Juan\", Derrick \"Mayday\", in conjunction with three other DJ's, one of whom was Eddie \"Flashin\" Fowlkes, launched themselves as a party crew called Deep Space Soundworks (also referred to as Deep Space). In 1980 or 1981 they met with Mojo and proposed that they provide mixes for his show, which they did end up doing the following year.During the late 1970s-early 1980s high school clubs such as Brats, Charivari, Ciabattino, Comrades, Gables, Hardwear, Rafael, Rumours, Snobs, and Weekends allowed the young promoters to develop and nurture a local dance music scene. As the local scene grew in popularity, DJs began to band together to market their mixing skills and sound systems to clubs that were hoping to attract larger audiences. Local church activity centers, vacant warehouses, offices, and YMCA auditoriums were the early locations where the musical form was nurtured.\n\n\n=== Juan Atkins ===\n\nOf the four individuals responsible for establishing techno as a genre in its own right, Juan Atkins is widely cited as \"The Originator\". Atkins' role was likewise acknowledged in 1995 by the American music technology publication Keyboard Magazine, which honored him as one of 12 Who Count in the history of keyboard music.In the early 1980s, Atkins began recording with musical partner Richard Davis (and later with a third member, Jon-5) as Cybotron. This trio released a number of rock and electro-inspired tunes, the most successful of which were Clear (1983) and its moodier followup, \"Techno City\" (1984).Atkins used the term techno to describe Cybotron's music, taking inspiration from Futurist author Alvin Toffler, the original source for words such as cybotron and metroplex. Atkins has described earlier synthesizer based acts like Kraftwerk as techno, although many would consider both Kraftwerk's and Juan's Cybotron outputs as electro. Atkins viewed Cybotron's Cosmic Cars (1982) as unique, Germanic, synthesized funk, but he later heard Afrika Bambaataa's \"Planet Rock\" (1982) and considered it to be a superior example of the music he envisioned. Inspired, he resolved to continue experimenting, and he encouraged Saunderson and May to do likewise.Eventually, Atkins started producing his own music under the pseudonym Model 500, and in 1985 he established the record label Metroplex. The same year saw an important turning point for the Detroit scene with the release of Model 500's \"No UFO's,\" a seminal work that is generally considered the first techno production. Of this time, Atkins has said:\n\nWhen I started Metroplex around February or March of '85 and released \"No UFO's,\" I thought I was just going to make my money back on it, but I wound up selling between 10,000 and 15,000 copies. I had no idea that my record would happen in Chicago. Derrick's parents had moved there, and he was making regular trips between Detroit and Chicago. So when I came out with 'No UFO's,' he took copies out to Chicago and gave them to some DJs, and it just happened.\n\n\n=== Chicago ===\n\nThe music's producers, especially May and Saunderson, admit to having been fascinated by the Chicago club scene and influenced by house in particular. May's 1987/1989 hit \"Strings of Life\" (released under the alias Rhythim Is Rhythim) is considered a classic in both the house and techno genres.Juan Atkins also believes that the first acid house producers, seeking to distance house music from disco, emulated the techno sound. Atkins also suggests that the Chicago house sound developed as a result of Frankie Knuckles' using a drum machine he bought from Derrick May. He claims:\n\nDerrick sold Chicago DJ Frankie Knuckles a TR909 drum machine. This was back when the Powerplant was open in Chicago, but before any of the Chicago DJs were making records. They were all into playing Italian imports; 'No UFOs' was the only U.S.-based independent record that they played. So Frankie Knuckles started using the 909 at his shows at the Powerplant. Boss had just brought out their little sampling footpedal, and somebody took one along there. Somebody was on the mic, and they sampled that and played it over the drumtrack pattern. Having got the drum machine and the sampler, they could make their own tunes to play at parties. One thing just led to another, and Chip E used the 909 to make his own record, and from then on, all these DJs in Chicago borrowed that 909 to come out with their own records.\nIn the UK, a club following for house music grew steadily from 1985, with interest sustained by scenes in London, Manchester, Nottingham, and later Sheffield and Leeds. The DJs thought to be responsible for house's early UK success include Mike Pickering, Mark Moore, Colin Faver, and Graeme Park.\n\n\n=== Detroit sound ===\n\nThe early producers, enabled by the increasing affordability of sequencers and synthesizers, merged a European synthpop aesthetic with aspects of soul, funk, disco, and electro, pushing electronic dance music into uncharted terrain. They deliberately rejected the Motown legacy and traditional formulas of R&B and soul, and instead embraced technological experimentation.\nWithin the last 5 years or so, the Detroit underground has been experimenting with technology, stretching it rather than simply using it. As the price of sequencers and synthesizers has dropped, so the experimentation has become more intense. Basically, we're tired of hearing about being in love or falling out, tired of the R&B system, so a new progressive sound has emerged. We call it techno!\nThe resulting Detroit sound was interpreted by Derrick May and one journalist in 1988 as a \"post-soul\" sound with no debt to Motown, but by another journalist a decade later as \"soulful grooves\" melding the beat-centric styles of Motown with the music technology of the time. May famously described the sound of techno as something that is \"...like Detroit...a complete mistake. It's like George Clinton and Kraftwerk are stuck in an elevator with only a sequencer to keep them company.\" Juan Atkins has stated that it is \"music that sounds like technology, and not technology that sounds like music, meaning that most of the music you listen to is made with technology, whether you know it or not. But with techno music, you know it.\"One of the first Detroit productions to receive wider attention was Derrick May's \"Strings of Life\" (1987), which, together with May's previous release, \"Nude Photo\" (1987), helped raise techno's profile in Europe, especially the UK and Germany, during the 1987\u20131988 house music boom (see Second Summer of Love). It became May's best known track, which, according to Frankie Knuckles, \"just exploded. It was like something you can't imagine, the kind of power and energy people got off that record when it was first heard. Mike Dunn says he has no idea how people can accept a record that doesn't have a bassline.\"\n\n\n=== Acid house ===\n\nBy 1988, house music had exploded in the UK, and acid house was increasingly popular. There was also a long-established warehouse party subculture based around the sound system scene. In 1988, the music played at warehouse parties was predominantly house. That same year, the Balearic party vibe associated with Ibiza-based DJ Alfredo Fiorito was transported to London, when Danny Rampling and Paul Oakenfold opened the clubs Shoom and Spectrum, respectively. Both night spots quickly became synonymous with acid house, and it was during this period that the use of MDMA, as a party drug, started to gain prominence. Other important UK clubs at this time included Back to Basics in Leeds, Sheffield's Leadmill and Music Factory, and in Manchester The Ha\u00e7ienda, where Mike Pickering and Graeme Park's Friday night spot, Nude, was an important proving ground for American underground  dance music. Acid house party fever escalated in London and Manchester, and it quickly became a cultural phenomenon. MDMA-fueled club goers, faced with 2 A.M. closing hours, sought refuge in the warehouse party scene that ran all night. To escape the attention of the press and the authorities, this after-hours activity quickly went underground. Within a year, however, up to 10,000 people at a time were attending the first commercially organized mass parties, called raves, and a media storm ensued.The success of house and acid house paved the way for wider acceptance of the Detroit sound, and vice versa: techno was initially supported by a handful of house music clubs in Chicago, New York, and Northern England, with London clubs catching up later; but in 1987, it was \"Strings of Life\" which eased London club-goers into acceptance of house, according to DJ Mark Moore.\n\n\n=== The New Dance Sound of Detroit ===\n\nThe mid-1988 UK release of Techno! The New Dance Sound of Detroit, an album compiled by ex-Northern Soul DJ and Kool Kat Records boss Neil Rushton (at the time an A&R scout for Virgin's \"10 Records\" imprint) and Derrick May, introduced of the word techno to UK audiences. Although the compilation put techno into the lexicon of music journalism in the UK, the music was initially viewed as Detroit's interpretation of Chicago house rather than as a separate genre. The compilation's working title had been The House Sound of Detroit until the addition of Atkins' song \"Techno Music\" prompted reconsideration. Rushton was later quoted as saying he, Atkins, May, and Saunderson came up with the compilation's final name together, and that the Belleville Three voted down calling the music some kind of regional brand of house; they instead favored a term they were already using, techno.\nDerrick May views this as one of his busiest times and recalls that it was a period where he was working with Carl Craig, helping Kevin, helping Juan, trying to put Neil Rushton in the right position to meet everybody, trying to get Blake Baxter endorsed so that everyone liked him, trying to convince Shake (Anthony Shakir) that he should be more assertive...and keep making music as well as do the Mayday mix (for the show Street Beat on Detroit's WJLB radio station) and run Transmat records.\nCommercially, the release did not fare as well and failed to recoup, but Inner City's production \"Big Fun\" (1988), a track that was almost not included on the compilation, became a crossover hit in fall 1988. The record was also responsible for bringing industry attention to May, Atkins and Saunderson, which led to discussions with ZTT records about forming a techno supergroup called Intellex. But, when the group were on the verge of finalising their contract, May allegedly refused to agree to Top of the Pops appearances and negotiations collapsed. According to May, ZTT label boss Trevor Horn had envisaged that the trio would be marketed as a \"black Petshop Boys.\"Despite Virgin Records' disappointment with the poor sales of Rushton's compilation, the record was successful in establishing an identity for techno and was instrumental in creating a platform in Europe for both the music and its producers. Ultimately, the release served to distinguish the Detroit sound from Chicago house and other forms of underground dance music that were emerging during the rave era of the late 1980s and early 1990s, a period during which techno became more adventurous and distinct.\n\n\n=== Music Institute ===\nIn mid-1988, developments in the Detroit scene led to the opening of a nightclub called the Music Institute (MI), located at 1315 Broadway in downtown Detroit. The venue was secured by George Baker and Alton Miller with Darryl Wynn and Derrick May participating as Friday night DJs, and Baker and Chez Damier playing to a mostly gay crowd on Saturday nights.\nThe club closed on November 24, 1989, with Derrick May playing \"Strings of Life\" along with a recording of clock tower bells. May explains:\n\nIt all happened at the right time by mistake, and it didn't last because it wasn't supposed to last. Our careers took off right around the time we [the MI] had to close, and maybe it was the best thing. I think we were peaking \u2013 we were so full of energy and we didn't know who we were or [how to] realize our potential. We had no inhibitions, no standards, we just did it. That's why it came off so fresh and innovative, and that's why...we got the best of the best.\nThough short-lived, MI was known internationally for its all-night sets, its sparse white rooms, and its juice bar stocked with \"smart drinks\" (the Institute never served liquor). The MI, notes Dan Sicko, along with Detroit's early techno pioneers, \"helped give life to one of the city's important musical subcultures \u2013 one that was slowly growing into an international scene.\"\n\n\n== German techno ==\n\nIn 1982, Talla 2XLC had begun to use the term techno as a genre name for instrumental electronic dance music at Frankfurt's City Music record store, when he started to categorize certain tracks by artists such as New Order, Depeche Mode, Kraftwerk, Heaven 17 and Front 242 under the heading techno, to sum up all technologically created dance music.\nThe collection of Talla 2XLC quickly became the basis for other DJs like Sven V\u00e4th. Talla 2XLC popularized the term even more in Germany when he founded the renowned and longstanding Technoclub dance event at Frankfurt's No Name Club in 1984, which later moved to the Dorian Gray club in 1987. Talla's club spot served as the hub for the regional EBM and electronic music scene, and according to J\u00fcrgen Laarmann, of Frontpage magazine, it had historical merit in being the first club in Germany to play almost exclusively electronic dance music.\n\n\n=== Frankfurt tape scene ===\nWith the foundation for the genre laid by Talla 2XLC in 1982, in the following period several young artists from Frankfurt started to experiment on cassette tapes with electronic music coming from the Frankfurt's City Music record store, mixing the current catalogue with new electronic sounds and pitched BPM. This became known as the Frankfurt tape scene.  \nThe Frankfurt tape scene evolved around the early and experimental work done by the likes of Tobias Freund, Uwe Schmidt, Lars M\u00fcller and Martin Schopf. Some of the work done by Andreas Tomalla, Markus Nikolai and Thomas Franzmann evolved in collaborative work under the Bigod 20 collective. While this early work was strongly characterized as experimental electronic music fused with strong EBM, krautrock, synthpop and technopop influences, the later work during the mid and late 80's clearly transitioned to a clear techno sound. \n\n\n=== Influence of Chicago and Detroit ===\nGermany's engagement with American underground dance music during the 1980s paralleled that in the UK. By 1987 a German party scene based around the Chicago sound was well established. The following year (1988) saw acid house making as significant an impact on popular consciousness in Germany as it had in England. In 1989 German DJs Westbam and Dr. Motte established the Ufo club, an illegal party venue, and co-founded the Love Parade. After the Berlin Wall fell on 9 November 1989, free underground techno parties mushroomed in East Berlin, and a rave scene comparable to that in the UK was established. East German DJ Paul van Dyk has remarked that techno was a major force in reestablishing social connections between East and West Germany during the unification period.\n\n\n=== Growth of German scene ===\nIn 1991 a number of party venues closed, including Ufo, and the Berlin Techno scene centered itself around three locations close to the foundations of the Berlin Wall: Planet, E-Werk, Bunker, and the long-lived Tresor. It was in Tresor at this time that a trend in paramilitary clothing was established (amongst the techno fraternity) by DJ Tanith; possibly as an expression of a commitment to the underground aesthetic of the music, or perhaps influenced by UR's paramilitary posturing. In the same period, German DJs began intensifying the speed and abrasiveness of the sound, as an acid infused techno began transmuting into hardcore. DJ Tanith commented at the time that \"Berlin was always hardcore, hardcore hippie, hardcore punk, and now we have a very hardcore house sound.\" This emerging sound is thought to have been influenced by Dutch gabber and Belgian hardcore; styles that were in their own perverse way paying homage to Underground Resistance and Richie Hawtin's Plus 8 Records. Other influences on the development of this style were European electronic body music (EBM) groups of the mid-1980s such as DAF, Front 242, and Nitzer Ebb.Changes were also taking place in Frankfurt during the same period but it did not share the egalitarian approach found in the Berlin party scene. It was instead very much centred around discoth\u00e8ques and existing arrangements with various club owners. In 1988, after the Omen opened, the Frankfurt dance music scene was allegedly dominated by the club's management and they made it difficult for other promoters to get a start. By the early 1990s Sven V\u00e4th had become perhaps the first DJ in Germany to be worshipped like a rock star. He performed centre stage with his fans facing him, and as co-owner of Omen, he is believed to have been the first techno DJ to run his own club. One of the few real alternatives then was The Bruckenkopf in Mainz, underneath a Rhine bridge, a venue that offered a non-commercial alternative to Frankfurt's discoth\u00e8que-based clubs. Other notable underground parties were those run by Force Inc. Music Works and Ata & Heiko from Playhouse records (Ongaku Musik). By 1992 DJ Dag & Torsten Fenslau were running a Sunday morning session at Dorian Gray, a plush discoth\u00e8que near the Frankfurt airport. They initially played a mix of different styles including Belgian new beat, Deep House, Chicago House, and synthpop such as Kraftwerk and Yello and it was out of this blend of styles that the Frankfurt trance scene is believed to have emerged.In 1993-94 rave became a mainstream music phenomenon in Germany, seeing with it a return to \"melody, New Age elements, insistently kitsch harmonies and timbres\". This undermining of the German underground sound lead to the consolidation of a German \"rave establishment,\" spearheaded by the party organisation Mayday, with its record label Low Spirit, DJ Westbam, Marusha, and a music channel called VIVA. At this time the German popular music charts were riddled with Low Spirit \"pop-Tekno\" German folk music reinterpretations of tunes such as \"Somewhere Over The Rainbow\" and \"Tears Don't Lie\", many of which became hits. At the same time, in Frankfurt, a supposed alternative was a music characterised by Simon Reynolds as \"moribund, middlebrow Electro-Trance music, as represented by Frankfurt's own Sven V\u00e4th and his Harthouse label.\"\n\n\n=== Tekkno versus techno ===\nIn Germany, fans started to refer to the harder techno sound emerging in the early 1990s as Tekkno (or Brett). This alternative spelling, with varying numbers of ks, began as a tongue-in-cheek attempt to emphasize the music's hardness, but by the mid-1990s it came to be associated with a controversial point of view that the music was and perhaps always had been wholly separate from Detroit's techno, deriving instead from a 1980s EBM-oriented club scene cultivated in part by DJ/musician Talla 2XLC in Frankfurt.At some point tension over \"who defines techno\" arose between scenes in Frankfurt and Berlin. DJ Tanith has expressed that Techno as a term already existed in Germany but was to a large extent undefined. Dimitri Hegemann has stated that the Frankfurt definition of techno associated with Talla's Technoclub differed from that used in Berlin. Frankfurt's Armin Johnert viewed techno as having its roots in acts such DAF, Cabaret Voltaire, and Suicide, but a younger generation of club goers had a perception of the older EBM and Industrial as handed down and outdated. The Berlin scene offered an alternative and many began embracing an imported sound that was being referred to as Techno-House. The move away from EBM had started in Berlin when acid house became popular, thanks to Monika Dietl's radio show on SFB 4. Tanith distinguished acid-based dance music from the earlier approaches, whether it be DAF or Nitzer Ebb, because the latter was aggressive, he felt that it epitomised \"being against something,\" but of acid house he said, \"it's electronic, it's fun it's nice.\" By Spring 1990, Tanith, along with Wolle XDP, an East-Berlin party organizer responsible for the X-tasy Dance Project, were organizing the first large scale rave events in Germany. This development would lead to a permanent move away from the sound associated with Techno-House and toward a hard edged mix of music that came to define Tanith and Wolle's Tekknozid parties. According to Wolle it was an \"out and out rejection of disco values,\" instead they created a \"sound storm\" and encouraged a form of \"dance floor socialism,\" where the DJ was not placed in the middle and you \"lose yourself in light and sound.\"\n\n\n== Developments ==\nAs the techno sound evolved in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it also diverged to such an extent that a wide spectrum of stylistically distinct music was being referred to as techno. This ranged from relatively pop oriented acts such as Moby to the distinctly anti-commercial sentiments of Underground Resistance. Derrick May's experimentation on works such as Beyond the Dance (1989) and The Beginning (1990) were credited with taking techno \"in dozens of new directions at once and having the kind of expansive impact John Coltrane had on Jazz\". The Birmingham-based label Network Records label was instrumental in introducing Detroit techno to British audiences. By the early 1990s, the original techno sound had garnered a large underground following in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. The growth of techno's popularity in Europe between 1988 and 1992 was largely due to the emergence of the rave scene and a thriving club culture.\n\n\n=== Exodus ===\nIn America, apart from regional scenes in Detroit, New York City, Chicago and Orlando, interest was limited. Producers from Detroit, frustrated by the lack of opportunity in their home country, looked to Europe for their future livelihood. This first wave of Detroit expatriates was soon joined by a number of up-and-coming artists, the so-called \"second wave\", including Carl Craig, Octave One, Jay Denham, Kenny Larkin, and Stacey Pullen, with UR's Jeff Mills, Mike Banks, and Robert Hood pushing their own unique sound. A number of New York producers were also making an impression at this time, notably Frankie Bones, Lenny Dee, and Joey Beltram. In the same period, close to Detroit (Windsor, Ontario), Richie Hawtin, with business partner John Acquaviva, launched the influential imprint Plus 8 Records.Developments in American-produced techno between 1990 and 1992 fueled the expansion and eventual divergence of techno in Europe, particularly in Germany. In Berlin, following the closure of a free party venue called Ufo, the club Tresor opened in 1991. The venue was for a time the standard bearer for techno and played host to many of the leading Detroit producers, some of whom relocated to Berlin. By 1993, as interest in techno in the UK club scene started to wane, Berlin was considered the unofficial techno capital of Europe.Although eclipsed by Germany, Belgium was another focus of second-wave techno in this time period. The Ghent-based label R&S Records embraced harder-edged techno by \"teenage prodigies\" like Beltram and C.J. Bolland, releasing \"tough, metallic tracks...with harsh, discordant synth lines that sounded like distressed Hoovers,\" according to one music journalist.In the United Kingdom, Sub Club opening in Glasgow in 1987 and Trade which opened its doors to Londoners in 1990 were pioneering venues which helped bring techno into the country. Both clubs were praised for their late opening hours and party-focused clientele. Trade has often been referred to as the 'original all night bender'.\n\n\n==== A Techno Alliance ====\nIn 1993, the German techno label Tresor Records released the compilation album Tresor II: Berlin & Detroit \u2013 A Techno Alliance, a testament to the influence of the Detroit sound upon the German techno scene and a celebration of a \"mutual admiration pact\" between the two cities. As the mid-1990s approached, Berlin was becoming a haven for Detroit producers; Jeff Mills and Blake Baxter even resided there for a time. In the same period, with the assistance of Tresor, Underground Resistance released their X-101/X-102/X103 album series, Juan Atkins collaborated with 3MB's Thomas Fehlmann and Moritz Von Oswald and Tresor-affiliated label Basic Channel had its releases mastered by Detroit's National Sound Corporation, the main mastering house for the entire Detroit dance music scene. In a sense, popular electronic music had come full circle, returning to Germany, home of a primary influence on the electronic dance music of the 1980s: D\u00fcsseldorf's Kraftwerk. Even the dance sounds of Chicago also had a German connection, as it was in Munich that Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte first produced the 1970s Eurodisco synthpop sound.\n\n\n=== Minimal techno ===\n\nAs techno continued to transmute a number of Detroit producers began to question the trajectory the music was taking. One response came in the form of so-called minimal techno (a term producer Daniel Bell found difficult to accept, finding the term minimalism, in the artistic sense of the word, too \"arty\"). It is thought that Robert Hood, a Detroit-based producer and one time member of UR, is largely responsible for ushering in the minimal strain of techno. Hood describes the situation in the early 1990s as one where techno had become too \"ravey\", with increasing tempos, the emergence of gabber, and related trends straying far from the social commentary and soul-infused sound of original Detroit techno. In response, Hood and others sought to emphasize a single element of the Detroit aesthetic, interpreting techno with \"a basic stripped down, raw sound. Just drums, basslines and funky grooves and only what's essential. Only what is essential to make people move\". Hood explains:\n\nI think Dan [Bell] and I both realized that something was missing \u2013 an element...in what we both know as techno. It sounded great from a production point of standpoint, but there was a 'jack' element in the [old] structure. People would complain that there's no funk, no feeling in techno anymore, and the easy escape is to put a vocalist and some piano on top to fill the emotional gap. I thought it was time for a return to the original underground.\n\n\n=== Jazz influences ===\n\nSome techno has also been influenced by or directly infused with elements of jazz. This led to increased sophistication in the use of both rhythm and harmony in a number of techno productions. Manchester (UK)-based techno act 808 State helped fuel this development with tracks such as \"Pacific State\" and \"Cobra Bora\" in 1989. Detroit producer Mike Banks was heavily influenced by jazz, as demonstrated on the influential Underground Resistance release Nation 2 Nation (1991). By 1993, Detroit acts such as Model 500 and UR had made explicit references to the genre, with the tracks \"Jazz Is The Teacher\" (1993) and \"Hi-Tech Jazz\" (1993), the latter being part of a larger body of work and group called Galaxy 2 Galaxy, a self-described jazz project based on Kraftwerk's \"man machine\" doctrine. This lead was followed by a number of techno producers in the UK who were influenced by both jazz and UR, Dave Angel's \"Seas of Tranquility\" EP (1994) being a case in point, Other notable artists who set about expanding upon the structure of \"classic techno\" include Dan Curtin, Morgan Geist, Titonton Duvante and Ian O'Brien.\n\n\n=== Intelligent techno ===\n\nIn 1991 UK music journalist Matthew Collin wrote that \"Europe may have the scene and the energy, but it's America which supplies the ideological direction...if Belgian techno gives us riffs, German techno the noise, British techno the breakbeats, then Detroit supplies the sheer cerebral depth.\" By 1992 a number of European producers and labels began to associate rave culture with the corruption and commercialization of the original techno ideal. Following this the notion of an intelligent or Detroit inspired pure techno aesthetic began to take hold. Detroit techno had maintained its integrity throughout the rave era and was pushing a new generation of so-called intelligent techno producers forward. Simon Reynolds suggests that this progression \"involved a full-scale retreat from the most radically posthuman and hedonistically functional aspects of rave music toward more traditional ideas about creativity, namely the auteur theory of the solitary genius who humanizes technology.\"The term intelligent techno was used to differentiate more sophisticated versions of underground techno  from rave-oriented styles such as breakbeat hardcore, Schranz, Dutch Gabber. Warp Records was among the first to capitalize upon this development with the release of the compilation album Artificial Intelligence Of this time, Warp founder and managing director Steve Beckett said\n\nthe dance scene was changing and we were hearing B-sides that weren't dance but were interesting and fitted into experimental, progressive rock, so we decided to make the compilation Artificial Intelligence, which became a milestone... it felt like we were leading the market rather than it leading us, the music was aimed at home listening rather than clubs and dance floors: people coming home, off their nuts and having the most interesting part of the night listening to totally tripped out music. The sound fed the scene.\nWarp had originally marketed Artificial Intelligence using the description electronic listening music but this was quickly replaced by intelligent techno. In the same period (1992\u201393) other names were also bandied about such as armchair techno, ambient techno, and electronica, but all referred to an emerging form of post-rave dance music for the \"sedentary and stay at home\". Following the commercial success of the compilation in the United States, Intelligent Dance Music eventually became the name most commonly used for much of the experimental dance music emerging during the mid-to-late 1990s.\nAlthough it is primarily Warp that has been credited with ushering the commercial growth of IDM and electronica, in the early 1990s there were many notable labels associated with the initial intelligence trend that received little, if any, wider attention. Amongst others they include: Black Dog Productions (1989), Carl Craig's Planet E (1991), Kirk Degiorgio's Applied Rhythmic Technology (1991), Eevo Lute Muzique (1991), General Production Recordings (1991), In 1993, a number of new \"intelligent techno\"/\"electronica\" record labels emerged, including New Electronica, Mille Plateaux, 100% Pure (1993) and Ferox Records (1993).\n\n\n=== Free techno ===\n\nIn the early 1990s a post-rave, DIY, free party scene had established itself in the UK. It was largely based around an alliance between warehouse party goers from various urban squat scenes and politically inspired new age travellers. The new agers offered a readymade network of countryside festivals that were hastily adopted by squatters and ravers alike. Prominent among the sound systems operating at this time were Exodus in Luton, Tonka in Brighton, Smokescreen in Sheffield, DiY in Nottingham, Bedlam, Circus Warp, LSDiesel and London's Spiral Tribe. The high point of this free party period came in May 1992 when with less than 24 hours notice and little publicity more than 35,000 gathered at the Castlemorton Common Festival for 5 days of partying.This one event was largely responsible for the introduction in 1994 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act; effectively leaving the British free party scene for dead. Following this many of the traveller artists moved away from Britain to Europe, the US, Goa in India, Koh Phangan in Thailand and Australia's East Coast. In the rest of Europe, due in some part to the inspiration of traveling sound systems from the UK, rave enjoyed a prolonged existence as it continued to expand across the continent.Spiral Tribe, Bedlam and other English sound systems took their cooperative techno ideas to Europe, particularly Eastern Europe where it was cheaper to live, and audiences were quick to appropriate the free party ideology. It was European Teknival free parties, such as the annual Czechtek event in the Czech Republic that gave rise to several French, German and Dutch sound systems. Many of these groups found audiences easily and were often centered around squats in cities such as Amsterdam and Berlin.\n\n\n=== Divergence ===\n\nBy 1994 there were a number of techno producers in the UK and Europe building on the Detroit sound, but a number of other underground dance music styles were by then vying for attention. Some drew upon the Detroit techno aesthetic, while others fused components of preceding dance music forms. This led to the appearance (in the UK initially) of inventive new music that sounded far-removed from techno. For instance jungle (drum and bass) demonstrated influences ranging from hip-hop, soul, and reggae to techno and house.\nWith an increasing diversification (and commercialization) of dance music, the collectivist sentiment prominent in the early rave scene diminished, each new faction having its own particular attitude and vision of how dance music (or in certain cases, non-dance music) should evolve. Some examples not already mentioned are trance, industrial techno, breakbeat hardcore, acid techno, and happy hardcore. Less well-known styles related to techno or its subgenres include the primarily Sheffield (UK)-based bleep techno, a regional variant that had some success between 1989 and 1991. \nAccording to Muzik magazine, by 1995 the UK techno scene was in decline and dedicated club nights were dwindling. The music had become \"too hard, too fast, too male, too drug-oriented, too anally retentive.\" Despite this, weekly night at clubs such as Final Frontier (London), House of God (Birmingham), Pure (Edinburgh, whose resident DJ Twitch later founded the more eclectic Optimo), and Bugged Out (Manchester) were still popular. With techno reaching a state of \"creative palsy,\" and with a disproportionate number of underground dance music enthusiasts more interested in the sounds of rave and jungle, in 1995 the future of the UK techno scene looked uncertain as the market for \"pure techno\" waned. Muzik described the sound of UK techno at this time as \"dutiful grovelling at the altar of American techno with a total unwillingness to compromise.\"By the end of the 1990s, a number of post-techno  underground styles had emerged, including ghettotech (a style that combines some of the aesthetics of techno with hip-hop and house music), nortec, glitch, digital hardcore, the so-called no-beat techno, and electroclash.In attempting to sum up the changes since the heyday of Detroit techno, Derrick May has since revised his famous quote in stating that \"Kraftwerk got off on the third floor and now George Clinton's got Napalm Death in there with him. The elevator's stalled between the pharmacy and the athletic wear store.\"\n\n\n=== Commercial exposure ===\n\nWhile techno and its derivatives only occasionally produce commercially successful mainstream acts\u2014Underworld and Orbital being two better-known examples\u2014the genre has significantly affected many other areas of music. In an effort to appear relevant, many established artists, for example Madonna and U2, have dabbled with dance music, yet such endeavors have rarely evidenced a genuine understanding or appreciation of techno's origins with the former proclaiming in January 1996 that \"Techno=Death\".The R&B artist, Missy Elliott, exposed the popular music audience to the Detroit techno sound when she featured material from Cybotron's Clear on her 2006 release \"Lose Control\"; this resulted in Juan Atkins' receiving a Grammy Award nomination for his writing credit. Elliott's 2001 album Miss E... So Addictive also clearly demonstrated the influence of techno inspired club culture.In recent years, the publication of relatively accurate histories by authors Simon Reynolds (Generation Ecstasy, also known as Energy Flash) and Dan Sicko (Techno Rebels), plus mainstream press coverage of the Detroit Electronic Music Festival, have helped to diffuse the genre's more dubious mythology. Even the Detroit-based company Ford Motors eventually became savvy to the mass appeal of techno, noting that \"this music was created partly by the pounding clangor of the Motor City's auto factories. It became natural for us to incorporate Detroit techno into our commercials after we discovered that young people are embracing techno.\" With a marketing campaign targeting under-35s, Ford used \"Detroit Techno\" as a print ad slogan and chose Model 500's \"No UFO's\" to underpin its November 2000 MTV television advertisement for the Ford Focus.\n\n\n== Antecedents ==\n\n\n=== Early use of the term 'Techno' ===\nIn 1977, Steve Fairnie and Bev Sage formed an electronica band called the Techno Twins in London, England. When Kraftwerk first toured Japan, their music was described as \"technopop\" by the Japanese press. The Japanese band Yellow Magic Orchestra used the word 'techno' in a number of their works such as the song \"Technopolis\" (1979), the album Technodelic (1981), and a rare flexi disc EP, \"The Spirit of Techno\" (1983). When Yellow Magic Orchestra toured the United States in 1980, they described their own music as technopop, and were written up in Rolling Stone Magazine. Around 1980, the members of YMO added synthesizer backing tracks to idol songs such as Ikue Sakakibara's \"Robot\", and these songs were classified as 'techno kayou' or 'bubblegum techno.' In 1985, Billboard reviewed the Canadian band Skinny Puppy's album, and described the genre as techno dance. Juan Atkins himself said \"In fact, there were a lot of electronic musicians around when Cybotron started, and I think maybe half of them referred to their music as 'techno.' However, the public really wasn't ready for it until about '85 or '86. It just so happened that Detroit was there when people really got into it.\"\n\n\n=== Proto-techno ===\nThe popularity of Euro disco and Italo disco\u2014referred to as progressive in Detroit\u2014and new romantic synthpop in the Detroit high school party scene from which techno emerged has prompted a number of commentators to try to redefine the origins of techno by incorporating musical precursors to the Detroit sound as part of a wider historical survey of the genre's development. The search for a mythical \"first techno record\" leads such commentators to consider music from long before the 1988 naming of the genre. Aside from the artists whose music was popular in the Detroit high school scene (\"progressive\" disco acts such as Giorgio Moroder, Alexander Robotnick, and Claudio Simonetti and synthpop artists such as Visage, New Order, Depeche Mode, The Human League, and Heaven 17), they point to examples such as \"Sharevari\" (1981) by A Number of Names, danceable selections from Kraftwerk (1977\u201383), the earliest compositions by Cybotron (1981), Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder's \"I Feel Love\" (1977), Moroder's \"From Here to Eternity\" (1977), and Manuel G\u00f6ttsching's \"proto-techno masterpiece\" E2-E4 (1981). Another example is a record entitled Love in C minor, released in 1976 by Parisian Euro disco producer Jean-Marc Cerrone; cited as the first so called \"conceptual disco\" production and the record from which house, techno, and other underground dance music styles flowed. Yet another example is Yellow Magic Orchestra's work which has been described as \"proto-techno\"Around 1983, Sheffield band Cabaret Voltaire began including funk and electronic dance music elements into their sound, and in later years, would come to be described as techno. Nitzer Ebb was an Essex band formed in 1982, which also showed funk and electronic dance music influence on their sound around this time. The Danish band Laid Back released \"White Horse\" in 1983 with a similar funky electronica sound.\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\nCertain electro-disco and European synthpop productions share with techno a dependence on machine-generated dance rhythms, but such comparisons are not without contention. Efforts to regress further into the past, in search of earlier antecedents, entails a further regression, to the sequenced electronic music of Raymond Scott, whose \"The Rhythm Modulator,\" \"The Bass-Line Generator,\" and \"IBM Probe\" are considered early examples of techno-like music. In a review of Scott's Manhattan Research Inc. compilation album the English newspaper The Independent suggested that \"Scott's importance lies mainly in his realization of the rhythmic possibilities of electronic music, which laid the foundation for all electro-pop from disco to techno.\" In 2008, a tape from the mid-to-late 1960s by the original composer of the Doctor Who theme Delia Derbyshire, was found to contain music that sounded remarkably like contemporary electronic dance music. Commenting on the tape, Paul Hartnoll, of the dance group Orbital, described the example as \"quite amazing,\" noting that it sounded not unlike something that \"could be coming out next week on Warp Records.\"\n\n\n== Music production practice ==\n\n\n=== Stylistic considerations ===\nIn general, techno is very DJ-friendly, being mainly instrumental (commercial varieties being an exception) and is produced with the intention of its being heard in the context of a continuous DJ set, wherein the DJ progresses from one record to the next via a synchronized segue or \"mix.\" Much of the instrumentation in techno emphasizes the role of rhythm over other musical parameters, but the design of synthetic timbres, and the creative use of music production technology in general, are important aspects of the overall aesthetic practice.\nUnlike other forms of electronic dance music that tend to be produced with synthesizer keyboards, techno does not always strictly adhere to the harmonic practice of Western music and such strictures are often ignored in favor of timbral manipulation alone. Thus techno inherits from the modernist tradition of the so-called Klangfarbenmelodie, or timbral serialism. The use of motivic development (though relatively limited) and the employment of conventional musical frameworks is more widely found in commercial techno styles, for example euro-trance, where the template is often an AABA song structure.The main drum part is almost universally in common time (4/4); meaning 4 quarter note pulses per bar. In its simplest form, time is marked with kicks (bass drum beats) on each quarter-note pulse, a snare or clap on the second and fourth pulse of the bar, with an open hi-hat sound every second eighth note. This is essentially a disco (or even polka) drum pattern and is common throughout house and trance music as well. The tempo tends to vary between approximately 120 bpm (quarter note equals 120 pulses per minute) and 150 bpm, depending on the style of techno.\nSome of the drum programming employed in the original Detroit-based techno made use of syncopation and polyrhythm, yet in many cases the basic disco-type pattern was used as a foundation, with polyrhythmic elaborations added using other drum machine voices. This syncopated-feel (funkiness) distinguishes the Detroit strain of techno from other variants. It is a feature that many DJs and producers still use to differentiate their music from commercial forms of techno, the majority of which tend to be devoid of syncopation. Derrick May has summed up the sound as 'Hi-tech Tribalism': something \"very spiritual, very bass oriented, and very drum oriented, very percussive. The original techno music was very hi-tech with a very percussive feel... it was extremely, extremely Tribal. It feels like you're in some sort of hi-tech village.\"\n\n\n=== Compositional techniques ===\n\nThere are many ways to create techno, but the majority will depend upon the use of loop-based step sequencing as a compositional method. Techno musicians, or producers, rather than employing traditional compositional techniques, may work in an improvisatory fashion, often treating the electronic music studio as one large instrument. The collection of devices found in a typical studio will include units that are capable of producing many different sounds and effects. Studio production equipment is generally synchronized using a hardware- or computer-based MIDI sequencer, enabling the producer to combine in one arrangement the sequenced output of many devices. A typical approach to using this type of technology compositionally is to overdub successive layers of material while continuously looping a single measure or sequence of measures. This process will usually continue until a suitable multi-track arrangement has been produced.Once a single loop-based arrangement has been generated, a producer may then focus on developing how the summing of the overdubbed parts will unfold in time, and what the final structure of the piece will be. Some producers achieve this by adding or removing layers of material at appropriate points in the mix. Quite often, this is achieved by physically manipulating a mixer, sequencer, effects, dynamic processing, equalization, and filtering while recording to a multi-track device. Other producers achieve similar results by using the automation features of computer-based digital audio workstations. Techno can consist of little more than cleverly programmed rhythmic sequences and looped motifs combined with signal processing of one variety or another, frequency filtering being a commonly used process. A more idiosyncratic approach to production is evident in the music of artists such as Twerk and Autechre, where aspects of algorithmic composition are employed in the generation of material.\n\n\n=== Retro technology ===\n\nInstruments used by the original techno producers based in Detroit, many of which are now highly sought after on the retro music technology market, include classic drum machines like the Roland TR-808 and TR-909, devices such as the Roland TB-303 bass line generator, and synthesizers such as the Roland SH-101, Kawai KC10, Yamaha DX7, and Yamaha DX100 (as heard on Derrick May's seminal 1987 techno release Nude Photo). Much of the early music sequencing was executed via MIDI (but neither the TR-808 nor the TB-303 had MIDI, only DIN sync) using hardware sequencers such as the Korg SQD1 and Roland MC-50, and the limited amount of sampling that was featured in this early style was accomplished using an Akai S900.The TR-808 and TR-909 drum machines have since achieved legendary status, a fact that is now reflected in the prices sought for used devices. During the 1980s, the 808 became the staple beat machine in Hip hop production while the 909 found its home in House music and techno. It was \"the pioneers of Detroit techno [who] were making the 909 the rhythmic basis of their sound, and setting the stage for the rise of Roland's vintage Rhythm Composer.\" In November 1995 the UK music technology magazine Sound on Sound noted:\nThere can be few hi-tech instruments which still command a second-hand price only slightly lower than their original selling price 10 years after their launch. Roland's now near-legendary TR-909 is such an example\u2014released in 1984 with a retail price of \u00a3999, they now fetch up to \u00a3900 on the second-hand market! The irony of the situation is that barely a year after its launch, the 909 was being 'chopped out' by hi-tech dealers for around \u00a3375, to make way for the then-new TR-707 and TR-727. Prices hit a new low around 1988, when you could often pick up a second-user 909 for under \u00a3200\u2014and occasionally even under \u00a3100. Musicians all over the country are now garrotting themselves with MIDI leads as they remember that 909 they sneered at for \u00a3100\u2014or worse, the one they sold for \u00a350 (did you ever hear the one about the guy who gave away his TB-303 Bassline\u2014now worth anything up to \u00a3900 from true loony collectors\u2014because he couldn't sell it?)\n\nBy May 1996, Sound on Sound was reporting that the popularity of the 808 had started to decline, with the rarer TR-909 taking its place as \"the dance floor drum machine to use.\" This is thought to have arisen for a number of reasons: the 909 gives more control over the drum sounds, has better programming and includes MIDI as standard. Sound on Sound reported that the 909 was selling for between \u00a3900 and \u00a31100 and noted that the 808 was still collectible, but maximum prices had peaked at about \u00a3700 to \u00a3800. Such prices have held in the 12 years since the article was published, this can be evidenced by a quick search on eBay. Despite this fascination with retro music technology, according to Derrick May \"there is no recipe, there is no keyboard or drum machine which makes the best techno, or whatever you want to call it. There never has been. It was down to the preferences of a few guys. The 808 was our preference. We were using Yamaha drum machines, different percussion machines, whatever.\"\n\n\n==== Emulation ====\nIn the latter half of the 1990s the demand for vintage drum machines and synthesizers motivated a number of software companies to produce computer-based emulators. One of the most notable was the ReBirth RB-338, produced by the Swedish company Propellerhead and originally released in May 1997. Version one of the software featured two TB-303s and a TR-808 only, but the release of version two saw the inclusion of a TR-909. A Sound on Sound review of the RB-338 V2 in November 1998 noted that Rebirth had been called \"the ultimate techno software package\" and mentions that it was \"a considerable software success story of 1997\". In America Keyboard Magazine asserted that ReBirth had \"opened up a whole new paradigm: modeled analog synthesizer tones, percussion synthesis, pattern-based sequencing, all integrated in one piece of software\". Despite the success of ReBirth RB-338, it was officially taken out of production in September 2005. Propellerhead then made it freely available for download from a website called the \"ReBirth Museum\". The site also features extensive information about the software's history and development.In March 2001, with the release of Reason V1, Propellerhead upped the ante in providing a \u00a3300 software-based electronic music studio, comprising a 14-input automated digital mixer, 99-note polyphonic 'analogue' synth, classic Roland-style drum machine, sample-playback unit, analogue-style step sequencer, loop player, multitrack sequencer, eight effects processors, and over 500 MB of synthesizer patches and samples. With this release Propellerhead were credited with \"creating a buzz that only happens when a product has really tapped into the zeitgeist, and may just be the one that many [were] waiting for.\" Reason has since achieved popular appeal and is as of 2018 at version 10.\n\n\n=== Technological advances ===\nAs computer technology became more accessible and music software advanced, interacting with music production technology was possible using means that bore little relationship to traditional musical performance practices: for instance, laptop performance (laptronica) and live coding.\nBy the mid 2000s a number of software-based virtual studio environments had emerged, with products such as Propellerhead's Reason and Ableton Live finding popular appeal. These software-based music production tools offer viable and cost-effective alternatives to typical hardware-based production studios, and thanks to advances in microprocessor technology, can create high quality music using little more than a single laptop computer. Such advances democratized music creation, and lead to a massive increase in the amount of home-produced music available to the general public via the internet. Artists can now also individuate their sound by creating personalized software synthesizers, effects modules, and various composition environments. Devices that once existed exclusively in the hardware domain can easily have virtual counterparts. Some of the more popular software tools for achieving such ends are commercial releases such as Max/Msp and Reaktor and freeware packages such as Pure Data, SuperCollider, and ChucK. In some sense, as a result of technological innovation, the DIY mentality that was once a core part of dance music culture is seeing a resurgence.\n\n\n== Notable techno venues ==\n\nIn Germany, the most renowned pure techno clubs of the 1990s include Tresor, E-Werk and Bunker in Berlin, Omen and Dorian Gray in Frankfurt, Ultraschall and KW \u2013 Das Heizkraftwerk in Munich as well as Stammheim in Kassel. In the late 2000s, Berghain, which has been referred to as the possible \"current world capital of techno\", became Berlin's most renowned techno club next to the second incarnation of the Tresor club. In the 2010s, Germany continues to have a lively techno scene with many notable techno clubs also outside of Berlin including Gew\u00f6lbe in Cologne, Institut f\u00fcr Zukunft in Leipzig, MMA Club and Blitz Club in Munich, Die Rakete in Nuremberg, Robert Johnson in Offenbach am Main and White Noise in Stuttgart. In the United Kingdom Glasgow's Sub Club has been associated with techno since the early 1990s and clubs such as London's Fabric and Egg London have gained notoriety for supporting techno. In the 2010s, a techno scene also emerged in Georgia, with the Bassiani in Tbilisi being the most notable venue.\nIn the Netherlands a notable venue is the Gashouder in Amsterdam where the infamous Awakenings parties are held and the Awakenings festival in Spaarnwoude.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDetroit Electronic Music Archive\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTechno Live Sets - The #1 resource for Techno sets\n\"From the Autobahn to I-94: The Origins of Detroit Techno and Chicago House\" \u2013 reminiscences in 2005 by techno and house innovators\nSounds Like Techno \u2013 online historical documentary produced by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)\nTechno from past years \u2013 Oldie but goldie classic techno sets", "chinese_title": "Techno ", "chinese": "Techno, translated \"High Tech Dance\", \"Tienkno Music\", is an electronic dance music, originated in the mid-US Sichuan Detroit in the mid-1980s to advanced US Michigan. In 1988, the term \"Techno\" was first used as a type of music. Today, all kinds of songs on the dance pools, the family is still unloading, but the Detroit Techno is still considered a substrate for all branch.\nLefeng formation begins with two music: Ou Luo Electronic music from the white people, such as Kraftwerk, and the US black music such as the Bunk, Electro, Chicago House and Sir, In addition to this, with the US late Capitalist society is related to the future science magnetic themes, which also affects Turkova, especially the \"Third Wave\" of Alvin Toffler. Juan Atkins, Juan Atkins, said that he uses \"Techno\" to describe the music style you created, is the vocabulary \"Techno Reason\" invented by Tovers. \"Techno Rebels\" is inspired; the unique influence element is based on the unique influence element, people will include Tiekenno into a aesthetic concept called a black futuristic (Afrofuturism). For the manufacturers such as Derrick May, the soul is moved from the flesh to the machine, which is their central idea, a performance of a scientific soul; from this point of view, \"Tienkno dance Di Oao The alienation effect caused by THEODOR ADOORNO is mechanized to modern awareness.\n\n\n== Origin ==\n\nThe original blueprint of Tienkno has known the lauds of Michigan, Michigan, the mid-1980s; KEVIN Saunderson, Kevin Saunderson and Delik Mei (commonly known as Detroit Three giants [the belleville three]) and Addie Fowlkes are created, and the four people are at the Belleville High of Detroit, and they have been an end of the 80s. They are already different. Record and release of Artists: Atkins' name is Model 500, FlintStones and Magic Juan, Fox is \"flash\" Eddie Flow (Eddie \"Flashin\" Fowlkes), Sanderson for Reese, Keynotes with Kaos , Mei Mayday, R-Tyme and Rhythim IS Rhythim. During this period, four people have worked several times, among the most successful examples of the market, that is, Atkins and Sanderson (also James Pennington [James Pennington] and Arthur Ferry Cooperation Planning of Stel [Arthur Forest] - Inner City's first single <BIG FUN> (page archive backup, existing in Internet Archive).\n\n\n=== Campus period ===\nBefore the famous name, Atkins, Sanderson, Mei, Fox, these young musicians of these initials, often exchange mixed tapes to each other, dreaming together to become big DJ. They also got the music inspiration from the Midnight Funk Association, which is a late-night radio program that is more than five hours, the music content is compatible, and there are playbacks in the major under Speed \u200b\u200bRadio. From 1977 to the mid-1980s, the show is presided over by a person called \"discharge curse\" Thals Qi (DJ Charles \"The Electrory Mojo\" Johnson). In the spell master, you will hear the Giorgio Moroder, Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream, etc. Ou Luo Electronic Music, Parliament's loaf music, and a new wave that is suitable for dancing. For example, DEVO and THE B-52'S. Atkins once said:\n\nHe (curse) will vigorously send Parliament and Funkadelic. The two groups were very red in Detroit at the time. They can even be said to be the main reason for the '79 Disco (Disco) could not be rooted in Detroit. The curse will put a lot of ways to let go, just don't want to turn on the station that I have turned to Daske. <Knee Deep>] The appearance of only the last side of the Camel, declared discruption.\nAlthough Dischad is not long in Detroit, he inspires many people to start mixing songs. Atterskin is an example. Atkins will teach Mei to come into songs, in 1981, \"Magic Juan\" (\" \"MAYDAY\" Derrick \"Mayday\") and other three (one of them \"shiny\" Aidi Fox), forming party group Deep Soundworks (also known as Deep Space), 1980 or 1981 They also encountered a spell man, and proposed to provide a programming to play; the proposal took effect in the past year.\nAt the end of the 1970s, the high school student dance hall became a hotbed of the boiler. The young party uses the new DJ with their music, catering the local young audience, successfully develops and cultivates the local dance environment. As the local dance hall is getting red, DJ has also begun to set up a group, in order to sell their mixed song skills and audio systems to the ballroom, cater to the listening audience; the local church event center, empty warehouse, office, ymca auditorium, They are all attracted to the party to hold the party in the age of 18, and it is also a place where music gradually grows.\n\n\n== \u80e1 Atkins ===\n\nEstablish Tieken into a formal music, the above four have a credit, but Atkin is recognized as \"founder\". Atkins' contributions to music, in 1995, the \"Keyboard Magazine\", \"Keyboard Magazine\" in 1995, was selected as one of the \"Twelve Key People\" in keyboard music history. In the early 1980s, Atkins and the \"3070\" Richard Davis (Richard \"3070\" Davis), and the John No. 5 (Jon-5) added to John (Jon-5) was established. There have been a lot of creation of rock and ELECTRO music before and after this three-person group. The most successful single song is <CLEAR> (page archive backup, existing in Internet Archive) (1983) and the next more gloomy <Techno City> (Page Archive Backup, Save Internet Archive) (1984).\nBased on his day ago, Atkins claimed \"\u22ef Create\" Techno \"word to describe their music, and draw inspiration from the future works and Evans Tovers;\" Cybotron \"and\" Metroplex \", etc. Name is the vocabulary of Tuto. Atkins uses Techno's words to describe a large number of groups of synthesizers. Kraftwerk is an example; but many people will mark Kraftwerk, marked with jan in the early stage of Cybotron. It is very satisfied with the single-cosmic Cars> of Cybotron (Page Archive, Sandy Duty, Saving By Internet Archive) (1982); It is also useful to be unique, full of Germanic style, but also The synthesizer is rendered, but when he later heard the Afrika Bambaataa <Planet Rock> (page archive backup, existing in Internet Archive) (1982), it was found that it was the ideal music in his mind. He was inspired by Afrika Bambaataa, he was determined to continue to work, and Zanderson and Mei have been encouraged to work together.\nLater, Atkins began to make their own music in the art of Model 500, in 1985, the Metroplex music factory was established in 1985 and issued a giant named <NO UFOS> (page archive backup, and Internet archive) in the same year. For the first time, it is the first to discuss the Detroitial Single, which is also the development of Techno development. About this history, Atkins said:\n\nI found Metroplex in 1985 and March, and issued <NO UFOS>, I thought I could only play flat, who knows that I actually sold 10,000 to 15,000. I have never thought about my record in Chicago. At that time, Drek's parents just moved it. Derk is often between Detroit and Chicago, so when I got it, he took several DJs to Chicago to the local DJ, the result is red .\n\n\n=== Voice of Detroit ===\nEarly producer uses the increasingly cheap consolidation machine and synthesizer, combining the Synth-POP aesthetics and soul, letks, Disocate and Electro, open the new vision for electronic dance music. They deliberately stay away from the voice of Mogcles (the page archive backup, the Internet archive), which is the traditional architectuality of R & B and the soul music, which is engaged wholeheartedly.\n\nIn the past five years, the underground music industry in the Detroit is beginning to use technology to do various experiments and invent various creative gameplay. As the price of the composer and the synthesizer fell, more experiments have also been in full swing. Simply, we are tired of songs about love or loss of love, tired of the entire R & B system; now a new avant-garde voice has emerged, we call it TECHNO!\nJuan Atkins (1988)\nIn 1988, this new primary III was explained as a \"post-soul\" (\"post-soul\") that was completely irrelevant to Mosaic, but ten years later, it was another one. The music reporter is a \"Soulful Groove\", which means it mixed with the retest style of Mosaic and the music technology at the time. Mei pair this kind of music has a familiar described: \"\u22ef and Detroit are a big fallacy. Just like George Clinton with Kraftwerk in the same elevator, leaving only one composer Give them time. \"Juan Atkins' explanation of Techno is:\" It sounds like technology music, not to listen to technology like music. Mean that you usually have mostly heard music is from technology Made, no matter what you realize. But when you listen to Techno, you will know. \"\nThe new music has affected the various extremely different electrical music, but also maintains its independent song wind, which is known as the \"Detroit\".\n\n\n=== Chicago ===\nTiecano producer, especially Mei and Sanderson, acknowledged very much like the Chicago ballroom, and is influenced by Hao Room Music. Plum in 1987/1989 Popular Single <Strings of Life> (Page Archive Backup, Delivered to Internet Archive) (released by Art Rame Rhythim Is Rhythim) is also classic giant by Hao Room and Tieno boundaries Work. But Atkins also believes that the first batch of psychedelic Houbo Music (ACID House), in order to let Hao Room music from Dischad, there is a trial of the sound of Mo. There is even a saying that the Chicago Han Room is actually playing with a drum machine purchased from Derrick Mena. Juan Atkins claimed:\n\nDerik sells a TR909 drumper to Chicago DJ Flanki Narkz. At this point, the PowerPlant ballroom has been opened in Chicago, but there is no Chicago DJ has its own creation. They were prevalently placed on the import records; <No Ufos> was the only independent record of the United States. Later, Franki Narkos started using a 909 drum machine in his PowerPlant's performance, and some people took the small sampling pedals just launched by BOS, just singing with the microphone, they will sample the sound Put out through the rhythm track. With a drum machine and sampling machine, they can play their own music, and things will happen in two years. Later, Qipei I (Chip E) made his own record with 909, from that start every Chicago Take that 909 to do your own record.\nIn the UK, the ballroom dominated by Hao Room Music has continued to grow since 1985, and its music environment is supported by the dance of London, Manchester, Nottingham, Sheffield and Litz. Early Hao Room In the UK, the UK was reddish, and Mark Moore (Mark Moore), Colin Faver and Graeme Park.\n\n\n==== Psychedelo Hao Room ====\nIn 1988, Hao Room Music was very popular in the UK, and the psychedelic room has also begun to gradually become popular. Warehouse Party Subculture (Warehouse Party Subculture) (the Internet Archive Backup, Saves Internet Archive) has a good foundation in 1988. The main played music is Hao Room. On the same year, Danny Rampling and Paul Oaknfold each opened the SHOOM and SPECTRUM ballroom, introduced from Ivsa (Ibiza) DJ Aflango The Barlearic Party of the Hand of Alfredo Fiorito. The two nightclubs quickly became synonymous with the violi violta, and the Happy Pill (MDMA) has also begun to become a dispute. Other Other Important Ballrooms in the UK include Lit to Basics, Sheffield's Leadmill and Music Factory, with Manchester's The Ha\u00e7ointa (Page Archive Backup, Save Internet Archives). Mike Piclin's Friday, the Skin Location of the Friday, which became the promotional garden of the American electronic dance, including the first NGA, Ironeno music from Detroit.\nThe psychedelic Houfang is booming in London and Manchester, soon become a cultural phenomenon. The body is full of MDMA's dance, unacceptable Only two-in-morning business dance hall, so that the warehouse party to continue the whole night seeks shelter. In order to avoid the media to pay attention to the police, these entertainment activities after get off work will soon undergone, but in the year, some warehouse dispatches gradually evolved into large-scale parties with commercial scale, called \"Rui Dance Party\" (RAVES) And the average will attract about 10,000 people to participate; conceivable, the media storm will follow.\nThe success of the Hao Room and the Phantine Hou room is the road of substitution, the development of a broader listener, but it is also important; Tienkno is first received by a few Chicago, New York and the North Hana Ballroom in the north of the United Kingdom, Detroit local The dance hall was later caught up. However, according to DJ Mark Moore, in 1987, it was <strings of life> (page archive backup, existing in the Internet Archive), let London dance began to gradually accept Hao Room Music.\n\n\n=== \"TECHNO! New dance song from Detroit \"===\n\nThe electronic dance music in the end of the 1980s provides a contest for Techno, making it developed into a formal curvature of identity. In 1988, the UK issued\nTechno! New Dance from Detroit \"(Techno! The New Dance Sound of Dtroit) (Page Archive Backup, Save Internet Archive), a Board of the Former Northern Soul Soul DJ and Kool Kat Board, Neil Ruston (He was the \"10 Records\" of Wei Jing Brand's brand \"10 Records\" and the collection of Delik Mei, which is an important milestone named \"Techno\" for the first time. Although this album has successfully arched \"Techno\" into the music reporting the word library, Techno itself still has a period of time, by the public, is considered a high-tech Chicago Hao room, not pure self-made a color. In fact, the tipping of the title is originally \"The House Sound of Detroit\" until the entry of the works of Atkins <Techno Music> (the page archive backup, existing in the Internet Archive), Take them re-examine the title name. The final name of the compiled completion in Ruston is determined by him, Atkins, Mei and Sanderson. Detroit three giants opposed to a certain geographical voyage; proposing to replace another vocabulary, this vocabulary has been privately used for a long time, that is, \"Techno\". Drek Mei believes that is the busiest time in his life, he recalls:\n\nBusy with Carl Craig, busy helping Kevin, help Juan, want to help the people in Rustron, want to help Black Baxter back book, I hope everyone will agree with him, think of to persuade Schake (Anthony Shatker [Anthony Shakir] to let him know that he should be more fruitful ... and continue to be music, substrate the Detroit WJLB radio station \"street beats\" recording Mayday Mix tape, operate Transmat Record Products ... For so many years, no one has gone me and Hu An in Detroit in the end of dry numbness, and suddenly I found someone who I still cope with our people. It is really flying.\nAlthough Ruston's collection is not well sold, the Viking record is very disappointing, but the completion successfully lays a clear identity for Techno, and contributes well to Techno music and producers in Europe. Basically, the launch of this blend helps to distinguish between Detroit Techno, Chicago House, and other kinds of electronic dances generated by the 80th 90-year-old Dance Annual; TECHNO during that Dance has also become more ambitious, more independently Tree one.\n\n\n=== Detroys Ballroom: \"Music Academy\" ===\nIn 1988, as the Detroit music environment gradually flourished, a new night shop called \"Music Institute\", referred to as MI, was grandly opened in the Decreement. The venue comes from George Baker and Alton Miller, Darryl Wynn and Drick Dj, Dj, Baker and Ches Damir ( Chez Damier served as the comrades-based Saturday DJ. The ballroom was closed on November 24, 1989. Delhi Mei in the last play <strings of life> (page archive backup, existing in the Internet Archive), and stacked the sound of the tower bell sound. Mei Lin said:\n\n\"This is all about the brightness, so it doesn't last long, because we haven't intended to continue. When we (mi) end business, everyone's personal performance is beginning to take off, so maybe this arrangement It is the best. I think that we are in the peak - everyone is endless, nor sure that you are positioned, or how to play your potential; we don't have any constraints, there is no standard, everything just let go, then It is why the things come out so different, so innovation, that is why we get the essence of the essence. \"\nAlthough the life is not long, MI performs with all night DJ, and the Net White Ballroom and \"SMART Drinks\" (MI are not selling wine). According to Writers Dan Sicko, \"MI and Detroit Early Pioneer, together with the most important music culture of the city - a music culture that is about to board the international stage\"\n\n\n== Development ==\nAt the end of the 1980s, after the birth of the birth of the ceremony, there was no interruption in the development of the ceremony, forming a vast music spectrum; now from the popular oriented magic ratio, to the anti-Commercialism Group Underground Resistance (UR) and other styles Different music, all called Techno. Especially DRIK Mei is a \"Beyond The Dance\" (1989) and \"The Beginning\" (1990), the experiments have been rated \"Lead Techno to a variety of different new directions, causing this music The impact of John Coltrane is the impact of John Coltrane. \"Techno quickly smashed between 1988 and 1992, and in the UK, Germany, Belgium has a majority of underground supporting ethnic groups, all of which Thanks to the party named Rui Dance and the growing dance hall culture.\n\n\n=== Out of time ===\n\nIn the United States, in addition to regional music environments, such as Detroit, New York and Chicago, Techno's development is quite limited. Due to lack of opportunities, the Detroit producer has repeatedly frustrated in the development of the motherland, and they have turned to Europe to seek jobs. Soon, the first wave of immigrants overseas, found that there are many newly joined drafts around you, which is commonly known as \"second wave\"; these musicians include Carl Craig, Octave ONE, Jay Denham, Kenny Larkin, Stacey Pullen, also has a UR manufacturer's Jeff Mills Mike Banks and Robert Hood, they are working to develop their own unique voice. In addition, a group of New York producers also started to show their heads, the most famous for Frankie Bones, Lenny Dee and Joe Beltham (Joey Beltram); At this time, in Terram, Turlioton, Richie Hawtin, John Acquaviva, also launched an influential PLUS 8. From 1990 to 1992, Techno's development of the United States stimulated in Europe, especially Germany, in the future. In Berlin, with the closure of the free party's party venue UFO, a dance hall called Tresor opened in 1991. The site is a standard Techno church, and they entertain the top Detroit producer, some of which will even be moved to Berlin even in 1993, the British ballroom has gradually slowed down for Techno, and Berlin became an official \"Techno\" in Europe. capital\".\nAlthough many scenery is robbed by Germany, Belgium is also an important base of the second wave of Techno at this stage. R & S manufactured from Belgian City, implemented the heavy taste Techno created by Beltham and West, Boland, etc., was described by a music reporter as \"powerful, metal The like is a harsh, the sound of the synthesizer sounds sounds like it is very painful, and the arm group HOOVER. \"\n\n\n=== Berlin ===\n\nGermany's acquisition process with the US electronic dance music in Germany is similar to the UK. As in the UK, Germany served in 1987 as the Zhigago music, I have already launched a good foundation, and I've been in the impact of the German popular cultural awareness in Germany (1988). In 1989, two German DJ Weistet Bobs WESTBAMs were established with Motte, and established a illegal place for ufo, and founded Love Parade, while November 9, 1989, Berlin Wall collapsed Afterwards, all kinds of underground techno free party, and the spring bamboo shoots continue to emerge in the East Germany, this is born. Dongde DJ Paul Fan Daik (Paul Van DYK) reflected that Techno was an important force in the beginning of the East and West Germany, rebuilding social cohesiveness.\nIn 1991, several factions face closed, including UFO, so Berlin's Techno music environment, which focused on the dance hall located near Berlin Wall: \"Planet\" (later by Paul Van Dai) E-Werk ), \"Der Bunker\" and more longevity \"Tresor\". The military uniform boom at that time (in Techno is worth it) is starting with Tresor, starting from a DJ called Tanith (may be submathered by Techno music, or Military image of UR The above is. At that time, the German DJ began to try to speed up the speed and become more ferocious. The psychedelic school gradually became a hardcore techno. DJ Tannis reflects the way: \"Berlin has always been a hard route, the hard rock is hippie, the rough Mark, now we have a very hard room.\" At the time, my average BPM had to 135, And it will increase by 15bpm every few months. This new voice is influenced by Gabber, the Netherlands, is formed with Belgian fine curvature; pay tribute to the Plus 8 of Underground Resistance and Ricki Hatin in its own form. Other influencing factors, including Electronic Body Music groups from Europe in the mid-20080, such as DAF, Front 242 and Nitzer EBB. In Germany, the fans will call this music \"Tekkno\" (or \"Bretter\").\n\n\n==== \"Berlin and Detroit: Techno double\" ====\n\nIn 1993, German Brand Tresor Records launched \"Berlin and Detroit: Techno Shuangshan\" (Techno Alliance), which is the testimony of Detroit music to the German Techno environmental impact, but also celebrate two The \"Mutual Friendship\" between the city. With the mid-term, Berlin became the safeguard of the Detroit producer; Jeff Mills and Black Baxter lived in a period of time; while in the same period, through Tresor (page archive backup, save The help of Internet Archives), Underground Resistance, also begins to issue their X-101 / X-102 / X103 series of X-101 / X-102 / X103 series, Juan Atkins began and Tomas Fehlmann and Mori Moritz Von Oswald, a group of 3MB, which is subordinate to Tresor, Basic Channel, also sent their music master to the Detroit's National Sound; That is Detroit Music at the time. The main master belt recording room. From a perspective, the popular electronic music is a circle, after all, the music group from Germany D\u00fcsseldorf, is the most popular music group affecting the e-dance in the 1980s. The words come back, in fact, the previous Chicago Hao room also has the influence of Germany, because Chic Chic Chico Morad and Peter Belot Belotte is Munich, Germany, creating a popular seventh or continental EURO-DISCO and Synthesizer Pop Music (Synth-POP).\n\n\n=== extremely simple ===\n\nAs the electronic dance class gradually changed, some Detroit producer began questioning the direction of the ceremony, so \"MINIMAL TECHNO\" came into being, and the producer Daniel Bell [Daniel Bell] is very comments on the term. He believes The meaning of \"Extremely Simplified\" refers to \"Art\"). Robert Hhu De, a production person from Detroit, was also a member of the UR, and is a publicly recognized very exckey. Hu De destroys the early music art \"too much\" in the nineCI to \"too much\", which has become the predecessor of Gabber. This trend makes the original Detroit that originally marked the soul rhythm, and also drives Hu De and other producers to change their music, create a \"decomposition, the most basic original sound. Only the drums, Bes, Book With the essential elements of it. A necessary feature that makes people dance. \"\nHu De explains:\nI feel that Dan (Bell) and I realized that there was something that I didn't see - an element of the Techno we heard at the time. at that time Music sounds great from the angle of production, but there is a \"Jack\" element having an old music. People will complain that I can't hear the release in Techno, can't hear the feelings, and a simple solution is to add vocals and piano to fill the emotions. But I think it's time to return to the original underground music.\n\n\n=== Jazz influence element ===\n\nMany jazz have an indirect or direct impact on the ceremony. This effect causes the rhythm and chords of certain works, while the combination of Manchester 808 State, more than the <Pacific State> included in the Mini Album \"QuadraState\" (page Archive Backup, existing in the Internet Archive), famous songs such as <Cobra Bora> (page archive backup, the Internet Archive) included in \"NineTy\", to promote this wave of jazz. At that time, in Detroit, the producer of the so-called jazz effectively, non-Mike Banks, the classic album \"Nation 2 Nation\" (1991) issued under Underground Resistance. By 1993, the MODEL 500 of Detroit, the artist group with UR, with <JAZZ IS TEACHER> (1993) and <Hi-Tech Jazz> (Page Archive Backup, Save Internet Archive) (1993), etc. Actively refer to this song; the latter is called Galaxy 2 Galaxy, which is a jazz plan that claims to be built on the Kraftwerk \"Man-Machine\" creed. This tide is later followed by the British Techno producer that is influenced by Jazz and UR, such as Dave Angel and his EP \"Seas of Tranquility\" (with the page archive backup, existing in the Internet Archive) (1994).\n\n\n=== Listening part ===\nIn 1991, the British music reporter Matthew Collin wrote: \"Europe may have a powerful environment and energy, but behind the scenes guidelines its consciousness is actually the bridge segment of the United States, Germany, Germany. Provide sound, British Techno offers broken shots, then Detroit is a pure thinking depth. \"In 1992, many European producers and labels, try to correct the so-called original Techno ideal corruption and commercialization, so a kind of dancing culture It is universally rejected, and a \"depth\", or as the perspective of Detroit is \"pure\" Techno aesthetics, and then start rooting. The Detroit has experienced the whole section of the Dance, which not only maintains its artistic insistence, but also inspires a new generation of \"Temple\" (Intelligent Techno).\nWith the arrival of the mid-1997, the term \"pure\" Techno, and the same source, but the music content has been more interesting, including the branch of more commercialization, and More hard, Rui Dance Breakbeat Hardcore, Schranz, with the Netherlands Gabber. Music reviewers Simon Reynolds believe that this development \"\u22ef thoroughly avoids the extreme humanism and enjoyment function of Rui Dance music, returning to more traditional creation concept, is the director's main theory of theory (Authuer THEORY) The lonely day of technology is humanized. \"\nMany recorders are profitable from the new trend, and the music manufacturers WARP \"Artificial Intelligence\" (page archive backup, the Internet Archive) is a case. Steve Beckett, a WARP Founder and General Manager, Memory:\n\nAt the time, the dance environment was shifting. We heard a lot of B-SIDES, not to dance, high interest, can be classified in experiment or front sanctuary, so we decided to \"Artificial Intelligence\" this photo, the result The collation actually became a testimony of history ... this feeling seems to be led by the market, not the market to control us. Our music is suitable for listening at home, not on the ballroom or dance pool: people can get the most interesting experience from listening to the psychedelic music at night. This music group is beginning to gradually increase.\nWARP initially won the word \"Artificial Intelligence\" in \"Electronic Listening Music\" (page archive backup, existing in the Internet Archive), but soon, it will soon replace it with the \"helody\". There are also many other trick names that are constantly spread, such as Ambient Techno, Ambient Techno, but actually describe the \"Hindu Dance Period\" audience. Listening \"and\" listening at home \". Following the completion of the business success in the United States, \"Treatment Dance\" was later used to describe the mid-to-end experimental electronic dance music in the mid-1990s.\nAlthough the heritage dance and the commercial success of Electronica are mainly due to WARP. In fact, there are many important labels in the early 1990s, and they are related to the trend of \"depth\", but did not pay attention at the time. These include Black Dog Productions (1989), Carl Crag's Planet E (1991), APPLIED RHYTHMIC TECHNOLOGY (1991), Eevo Lute Muzique (1991), General Production Recordings (1991), New Electronica (1993), Mille Plateaux (1993), 100% PURE (1993) with Ferox Records (1993).\n\n\n=== Free Techno party ===\n\nEarly in the early 1990s, a DIY free party scene in Post-Rave, starting roots in the UK. This scenario consists mainly of two ethnic groups - the warehouse party divisions from all-in-one airwood (New age travelers), which are inspired by political centuries; in the new century, Provides existing suburban music festival systems, allowing the air house steam and the Rui Dynasty to carry out the use. At that time, the active party sound group, with Tonka, Nottingham, Circus Warp, Lsdiesel in the Brighton region, Bedlam, Circus Warp, Lsdiesel and the Spiral Tribe of London (page archive backup, existing in Internet Archive). The most peak of the free party occurred in May 1992. At that time, the party was released in only 24 hours, and there were 35,000 tides in the Castlemorton Common Festival (Page Archive Backup). , Existed in Internet Archives), enjoy the five-day free night carnival.\nThe music offer is the main reason for the British government, enacted the Criminal Justice and Public Order ACT in 1994. This bill completely covers the British free party activities, forcing the craft artists to leave the UK, develop in Europe, the United States, India, Thailand, and the east banks such as Australia. In other parts of Europe, since the travel audio group from the UK is inspired, the Rui Dance activity has continued its lives and continued to spread toward the inland. Spiral TRIBE (Page Archive Backup, Save Internet Archives), Bedlam and other British audio groups, will bring mutual cooperation with Techno ideals to Europe, especially Eastern Europe; there is cheap, and the audience can quickly absorb and take a free party Awareness. European TEKNIVAL free party (page archive backup, existing in the Internet Archive), Czechtek, the Czech Republic (Page Archive Backup, Save Internet Archive), stimulating the audio group of France, Germany and the Netherlands, and these audio groups Soon, you will find your own audience, and the air houses in cities such as Amsterdam are the main centers.\n\n\n=== Lepai branch ===\nIn 1994, there were many producers from the UK and Europe, which was devised to create the Detroit-style Techno music. However, there were many producers who were constantly striving to create other types of electronic dance music. They will learn from the Detroit aesthetics, and some will merge different elements of the past dance, so many new varieties have begun to birth (mainly from the UK). In these new electronic dance music, some of the shadows of Techno are found out, and some sound is very different. Jungle Music (Drum Bes) is the most obvious example. It is obviously the influence of happiness and soul and Raytile music. The electronic dance music of Detroit and Chicago. With the diversity of dance music (and commercial), the collective consciousness unique to the early Rui Dance is delayed. Instead, all other independent factions have their own unique attitudes and to future dance music (or Non-dance music) The development of development, including transistial techno, ACID TECHNO and Happy Hardcore. A more small branch or related curved wind, including the Bleep Party, which is mainly due to the regional branch of the UK Sheffield. BLEEP sent a little attention from 1989 to 1991, the music environment created, is also a major cause of the WARP brand, which is red (Key point is the fifth release of WARP: LFO's same name album black rubber record) . In the late 1990, a batch of electronic dance music, including the post-techno, including Wonky, Ghettotech (a combination of Techno aesthetics, hip-hop and Hao Room music) Nortec, GLITCH, Digital Hardcore and the so-called NO-BEAT.\n\n\n== Lefeng front ==\n\nWhen discussing the source in the book, writer Kodwo Eshun advocated \"Kraftwerk to Techno, just like Muddy Waters): It's authentic, origin, is genuine.\" Juan Jiajin Scrats recognizes that Kraftwerk and Joceo Morad, especially Morad, and Donna Summer, as well as Morad's \"E = MC2\" album. Atkins also said that in 1980, he has a lot of Kraftwerk, Telex, Devo, Qiaogei Morad and Gary Numan's tape, will be crazy when driving . But Atkins also said that before working with Richard Davis, he did not hear Kraftwerk's music before cooperation with Richard Davis. For the initial impression of Kraftwerk, Atkins said that \"weird UFO tone\" than himself, \"weird UFO tone\" is relatively \"clean and precise\".\nDerrick Mei also admits the impact of Kraftwerk and other European synthesizer music. He said: \"The music sounds very fashionable, and pure, it is unlimited to us, like outer space. We live in Detroit, there is really beautiful things, in Detroit, everything is ugly A group of mess, so we were attracted by this music, and that music seems to ignite our imagination! \"\nMei believes that his music directly attacked the context of European synthesizer music. Kevin Sanderson also believed that he had an impact of Europe, but he stressed that he was inspired by the concept of electronic instruments to create music: \"I am more interested in everything I can come to this concept.\"\nDue to Mora, Alexander Robotnic and Claudio Simonetti, continenti, ITALO DISCO, and all new romantic synthesis Pop pop groups, such as Visage, The Human League and Heaven 17 and other orchestra, in the Detroit University Dance of Techno, the critical university dance will prompt the critics to redefine the origin, try to reduce these Detroit music pioneers into a broader historical context, Become a part of the evolution of the trick. As a result, the origin and distribution of the history of music will gradually be trusted.\n\nTo support this view, the critics raise a Number of Names (1981) single <Sharevari>, Kraftwerk (1977-83), Cybotron (1981) initial work, Donna Sangma and Qiaoge \u00b7 Morad's <I Feel Love>, Morad's <from here to eternity> and Manuel G\u00f6ttsching's masterpiece \"E2-E4\" (1981) as an illustration. Another example is 1976, Paris's continee producer \"Love In C Minor\" launched by Mark Chero; this album is called the first conceptual Disco (Conceptual Disco) It is also known as the ancestors of House, Techno and other electronic dance style.\nOf course, ELECTRO Distension is popular with Continental Synthesis, with Techno, depending on the machine, but this example is not controversial. Many people try to continue to push forward, find a longer e-dance root source, some people come to Raymond Scott, using the electronic music written by the sequencer, <The rhythm modulator>, <the bass- LINE Generator>, <IBM Probe> and other works It is considered to be a music similar to Techno's predecessor; the British Daily THEPENDENT also commented to the \"Manhattan Research Inc.\" of Shi Turtat: \"The importance of Shi Turtat is that he found an unlimited possibilities of electronic music in the rhythm. Sex, and there is therefore the foundation of electro-POP, Disocar, and even Techno and other dance music. \"Another example may be an example of the front of the electronic dance, and there is a roll of tape in the late 2010. is the British BBC Classic Science Fiction TV Series. \"Doctor Who\" (Doctor WHO) The work of Dalia Derbyshire, it sounds almost no difference in modern electronic dance. Paul Hartnoll, who was once a dance group Orbital, believed that this volume of sound cameras \"quite amazing\" and explained that there was no difference between the sound and any \"album that was about to be released in WARP label\".\n\n\n== Music production ==\n\n\n=== style element ===\nFor a whole, Techno music is very convenient to play, because most of the pure music preparation (except business orientation), and most of the production process will presen a continuous DJ mixing (DJ Set), that is DJ conversion from a record through synchronous, or \"mix\", advance to the continuous process of the next record. Most of the instrument is written, and most emphasize \"rhythm\" in all music parameters, but in addition, the design of artificial tone is the use of music production technology, and the overall Techno aesthetics is considerable.\nThe main drum group, almost recognized that four four-four shots (4/4) are mainly, meaning that the quadruption is a shot, and there are four shots in each section. In the simplest form, the drum will play on each beat, and the drum or clapper will play the second and fourth shots of each section, and the hollow cymbals will play on the second eight-point note per segment; It is a drum group of disco (or Polka), which is in House music, or similar to Techno et al. The general song speed is in different ways, with an average of 120 bpm (a minute of 120 shots) to 150bpm.\nSome of the original Detroitial, in the preparation of the drum group, will be used to make the tone and complex, however, now makes still in terms of Dice, and then use other drums to overlap the rhythm. Therefore, the loop taste produced by the cutting sound is one of the indicators of the identified Detroit. Nowadays, there are still many DJs and producers who will use this feature, separated their works with commercial Techno, because the mainstream music will have a slice. Delhi Mei's voice described as \"Hi-Tech Tribalism\" is a kind of \"full of soul, very heavy bass, also very heavy drums, very heavyweight, music. Music of the musical instrument. Entgest Techno music It is a very high-tech struggle that sounds very high-tech. You will think that you have come to a high-tech tribe. \"\n\n\n=== Retro technology ===\nInitial Detroit Makers, the instrument used by the Makers, now many of the dream essences in the retro music technology market, including the most classic drums Roland TR-808 and TR-909, and the Bes Synthesizer Roland TB303, and Roland SH- 101, Kawai KC10, Yamaha DX7, YAMAHA DX100 and other synthesizers (I have emerged in Drek Mei 1987, \"Nude Photo\" in the \"Nude Photo\" in 1987. Early multi-music compilation is performed through MIDI (although the TR-808 and TB-303 at the time does not have MIDI function, only DIN SYNC), using hard body sequencer such as Korg SQD1 and Roland MC-50, and the ancient morning music The little sampling sound is heard, most of them are masterpieces of the Akai S900.\nTR- 808 and TR-909 drums have now reached the status of the legend, which can be understood from the market. In the 808 drum machine, the 808 drum machine became the basic equipments of hip hop music, while the 909 drum machine found home in House and Techno music. \"It is the pioneer of the Detroit, set the 909 drum machine as the substrate of the music rhythm, and opened the opportunity to return to the market for the ancient morning rhythm composers that Luolan launched.\nIn September 1995, the British music science and technology magazine Sound On Sound wrote:\n\nFew high-tech instruments, the second hand price after ten years is only slightly lower than the original pricing. Roland has produced, and now the nearly legendary TR-909 is an example - the pricing laundering in 1984 is 999 pounds, and now the second-hand market price is 900 pounds! Ironically, this machine has been in less than a year, that is, the sales of technology products will be 375 pounds so that they will give the TR-707 and TR-727 that will be listed, and the price has fallen low in 1988, often It can be seen that people are less than \u00a3 200, hugging back a second-hand 909 machine, sometimes less than \u00a3 100. Now in the country, every musician is not regretted. I think of how they don't have a $ 100-pound of 909 dismissive - or even more miserable, they sell 909 with \u00a3 50 (have heard that there is a benevolent brother to send his TB-303 ? That machine, crazy collector is now expected to offer 900 pounds - and he sent it away because it can't be sold!), All want to hang suicide on his MIDI wire.\nIn May 1996, according to Sound On Sound, the charm of 808 has gradually cut, but more rare TR-909 becomes \"producing a must-have drum\", this situation will have several factors: 909 drum machine There is a great mastery of drums, and there is a good writing system and attached to the MIDI system. Sound On Sound reports that 909 today's market is about 900 to \u00a3 1,100, and 808 is also a collection value, but the highest price is only 700 to \u00a3 800.
