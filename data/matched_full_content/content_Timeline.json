{"topic": "Timeline", "english_title": "Timeline", "english": "A timeline is a display of a list of events in chronological order. It is typically a graphic design showing a long bar labelled with dates paralleling it, and usually contemporaneous events.\nTimelines can use any suitable scale representing time, suiting the subject and data; many use a linear scale, in which a unit of distance is equal to a set amount of time. This timescale is dependent on the events in the timeline. A timeline of evolution can be over millions of years, whereas a timeline for the day of the September 11 attacks can take place over minutes, and that of an explosion over milliseconds. While many timelines use a linear timescale\u2014especially where very large or small timespans are relevant -- logarithmic timelines entail a logarithmic scale of time; some \"hurry up and wait\" chronologies are depicted with zoom lens metaphors.\n\n\n== Types ==\nThere are different types of timelines\n\nText timelines, labeled as text\nNumber timelines, the labels are numbers, commonly line graphs\nInteractive, clickable, zoomable\nvideo timelines(timelines in the form of a video)There are many methods of visualizations for timelines. Historically, timelines were static images and generally drawn or printed on paper. Timelines relied heavily on graphic design, and the ability of the artist to visualize the data.\nTimelines, no longer constrained by previous space and functional limitations, are now digital and interactive, generally created with computer software. ChronoZoom is an example of computer-aided interactive timeline software.\n\n\n== Uses of timelines ==\n\nTimelines are often used in education to help students and researchers with understanding the order or chronology of historical events and trends for a subject.  When showing time on a specific scale on an axis, a timeline can be used to visualize time lapses between events, durations (such as lifetimes or wars), and the simultaneity or overlap of spans and events.\n\n\n=== In historical studies ===\nTimelines are particularly useful for studying history, as they convey a sense of change over time. Wars and social movements are often shown as timelines. Timelines are also useful for biographies. Examples include:\n\nTimeline of the civil rights movement\nTimeline of European exploration\nTimeline of imperialism\nTimeline of Solar System exploration\nTimeline of United States history\nTimeline of World War I\nTimeline of religion\n\n\n=== In natural sciences ===\nTimelines are also used in the natural world and sciences, for subjects such as astronomy, biology, and geology:\n\n2009 flu pandemic timeline\nChronology of the universe\nGeologic time scale\nTimeline of evolutionary history of life\n\n\n=== In project management ===\nAnother type of timeline is used for project management. In these cases, timelines are used to help team members to know what milestones need to be achieved and under what time schedule. For example, in the case of establishing a project timeline in the implementation phase of the life cycle of a computer system.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"British Library interactive timeline\". bl.uk/timeline.\n\"Port Royal des Champs museum timeline\". port-royal-des-champs.eu/frise.\n\"Timelines\", A selection of timelines relating mostly to science, biology, and botany, plantspeopleplanet.org.au", "chinese_title": "Timeline ", "chinese": "The timeline, also known as the timeline, and the way for a while or more axes (line).  == list timeline ==  Also known as \"water bill\", listen to the event by one line in the time.  == Image type timeline ==  == Application ==  history  In historical textbooks, the occurrence of historical events has been expressed in time axis. computer  In computer software (eg,: Dreamweaver), write pictures, text, and subtitle with a time axis.  == See ==  Era  Year list list "}
