{"topic": "Dentistry", "english_title": "Dentistry", "english": "Dentistry, also known as dental medicine and oral medicine, is a branch of medicine that consists of the study, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diseases, disorders, and conditions of the oral cavity, commonly in the dentition  but also the oral mucosa, and of adjacent and related structures and tissues, particularly in the maxillofacial (jaw and facial) area. Although primarily associated with teeth among the general public, the field of dentistry or dental medicine is not limited to teeth but includes other aspects of the craniofacial complex including the temporomandibular joint and other supporting, muscular, lymphatic, nervous, vascular, and anatomical structures.\nDentistry is often also understood to subsume the now largely defunct medical specialty of stomatology (the study of the mouth and its disorders and diseases) for which reason the two terms are used interchangeably in certain regions.Dental treatments are carried out by a dental team, which often consists of a dentist and dental auxiliaries (dental assistants, dental hygienists, dental technicians, as well as dental therapists). Most dentists either work in private practices (primary care), dental hospitals or (secondary care) institutions (prisons, armed forces bases, etc.).\nThe history of dentistry is almost as ancient as the history of humanity and civilization with the earliest evidence dating from 7000 BC to 5500 BC. Skeletal remains from Mehgarh (now in Pakistan) dated to that time show evidence of teeth having been drilled with flint tools to remove decay, a method found to be \"surprisingly effective\". Dentistry is thought to have been the first specialization in medicine. The modern movement of evidence-based dentistry calls for the use of high-quality scientific evidence to guide decision-making.\n\n\n== Terminology ==\nThe term dentistry comes from dentist, which comes from French dentiste, which comes from the French and Latin words for tooth. The term for the associated scientific study of teeth is odontology (from Ancient Greek: \u1f40\u03b4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2, romanized: odo\u00fas, lit.\u2009'tooth') \u2013 the study of the structure, development, and abnormalities of the teeth.\n\n\n== Dental treatment ==\nDentistry usually encompasses practices related to the oral cavity. According to the World Health Organization, oral diseases are major public health problems due to their high incidence and prevalence across the globe, with the disadvantaged affected more than other socio-economic groups.The majority of dental treatments are carried out to prevent or treat the two most common oral diseases which are dental caries (tooth decay) and periodontal disease (gum disease or pyorrhea). Common treatments involve the restoration of teeth, extraction or surgical removal of teeth, scaling and root planing, endodontic root canal treatment and cosmetic dentistryAll dentists in the United States undergo at least three years of undergraduate studies, but nearly all complete a bachelor's degree. This schooling is followed by four years of dental school to qualify as a \"Doctor of Dental Surgery\" (DDS) or \"Doctor of Dental Medicine\" (DMD). Specialization in dentistry is available in the fields of Anesthesiology, Dental Public Health, Endodontics, Oral Radiology, Oral Maxillofacial Surgery, Oral Medicine, Orofacial Pain, Pathology, Orthodontics, Pediatric Dentistry, Periodontics, and Prosthodontics.By nature of their general training they can carry out the majority of dental treatments such as restorative (fillings, crowns, bridges), prosthetic (dentures), endodontic (root canal) therapy, periodontal (gum) therapy, and extraction of teeth, as well as performing examinations, radiographs (x-rays), and diagnosis. Dentists can also prescribe medications such as antibiotics, sedatives, and any other drugs used in patient management. Depending on their licensing boards, general dentists may be required to complete additional training to perform sedation, dental implants, etc.\n\nDentists also encourage prevention of oral diseases through proper hygiene and regular, twice or more yearly, checkups for professional cleaning and evaluation. Oral infections and inflammations may affect overall health and conditions in the oral cavity may be indicative of systemic diseases, such as osteoporosis, diabetes, celiac disease or cancer. Many studies have also shown that gum disease is associated with an increased risk of diabetes, heart disease, and preterm birth. The concept that oral health can affect systemic health and disease is referred to as \"oral-systemic health\".\n\n\n== Education and licensing ==\n\nJohn M. Harris started the world's first dental school in Bainbridge, Ohio, and helped to establish dentistry as a health profession. It opened on 21 February 1828, and today is a dental museum. The first dental college, Baltimore College of Dental Surgery, opened in Baltimore, Maryland, US in 1840. The second in the United States was the Ohio College of Dental Surgery, established in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1845. The Philadelphia College of Dental Surgery followed in 1852. In 1907, Temple University accepted a bid to incorporate the school.\nStudies show that dentists that graduated from different countries, or even from different dental schools in one country, may make different clinical decisions for the same clinical condition. For example, dentists that graduated from Israeli dental schools may recommend the removal of asymptomatic impacted third molar (wisdom teeth) more often than dentists that graduated from Latin American or Eastern European dental schools.In the United Kingdom, the 1878 British Dentists Act and 1879 Dentists Register limited the title of \"dentist\" and \"dental surgeon\" to qualified and registered practitioners. However, others could legally describe themselves as \"dental experts\" or \"dental consultants\". The practice of dentistry in the United Kingdom became fully regulated with the 1921 Dentists Act, which required the registration of anyone practising dentistry. The British Dental Association, formed in 1880 with Sir John Tomes as president, played a major role in prosecuting dentists practising illegally. Dentists in the United Kingdom are now regulated by the General Dental Council.\nIn Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Finland, Sweden, Brazil, Chile, the United States, and Canada, a dentist is a healthcare professional qualified to practice dentistry after graduating with a degree of either Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS) or Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD). This is equivalent to the Bachelor of Dental Surgery/Baccalaureus Dentalis Chirurgiae (BDS, BDent, BChD, BDSc) that is awarded in the UK and British Commonwealth countries. In most western countries, to become a qualified dentist one must usually complete at least four years of postgraduate study; within the European Union the education has to be at least five years. Dentists usually complete between five and eight years of post-secondary education before practising. Though not mandatory, many dentists choose to complete an internship or residency focusing on specific aspects of dental care after they have received their dental degree.\n\n\n== Specialties ==\n\nSome dentists undertake further training after their initial degree in order to specialize. Exactly which subjects are recognized by dental registration bodies varies according to location. Examples include:\n\nCosmetic dentistry- Focuses on improving the appearance of the mouth,teeth and smile.\nAnesthesiology \u2013  The specialty of dentistry that deals with the advanced use of general anesthesia, sedation and pain management to facilitate dental procedures.\nDental public health \u2013 The study of epidemiology and social health policies relevant to oral health.\nEndodontics (also called endodontology) \u2013 Root canal therapy and study of diseases of the dental pulp and periapical tissues.\nForensic odontology \u2013 The gathering and use of dental evidence in law. This may be performed by any dentist with experience or training in this field. The function of the forensic dentist is primarily documentation and verification of identity.\nGeriatric dentistry or geriodontics \u2013 The delivery of dental care to older adults involving the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of problems associated with normal aging and age-related diseases as part of an interdisciplinary team with other health care professionals.\nOral and maxillofacial pathology \u2013 The study, diagnosis, and sometimes the treatment of oral and maxillofacial related diseases.\nOral and maxillofacial radiology \u2013 The study and radiologic interpretation of oral and maxillofacial diseases.\nOral and maxillofacial surgery (also called oral surgery) \u2013 Extractions, implants, and surgery of the jaws, mouth and face.\nOral biology \u2013 Research in dental and craniofacial biology\nOral Implantology \u2013 The art and science of replacing extracted teeth with dental implants.\nOral medicine \u2013 The clinical evaluation and diagnosis of oral mucosal diseases\nOrthodontics and dentofacial orthopedics  \u2013 The straightening of teeth and modification of midface and mandibular growth.\nPediatric dentistry (also called pedodontics) \u2013 Dentistry for children\nPeriodontology (also called periodontics) \u2013 The study and treatment of diseases of the periodontium (non-surgical and surgical) as well as placement and maintenance of dental implants\nProsthodontics (also called prosthetic dentistry) \u2013 Dentures, bridges and the restoration of implants.\nSome prosthodontists super-specialize in Maxillofacial Prosthetics, which is the discipline originally concerned with the rehabilitation of patients with congenital facial and oral defects such as cleft lip and palate or patients born with an underdeveloped ear (microtia). Today, most Maxillofacial Prosthodontists return function and esthetics to patients with acquired defects secondary to surgical removal of head and neck tumors, or secondary to trauma from war or motor vehicle accidents.\nSpecial needs dentistry (also called special care dentistry) \u2013 Dentistry for those with developmental and acquired disabilities.\nSports dentistry \u2013 the branch of sports medicine dealing with prevention and treatment of dental injuries and oral diseases associated with sports and exercise. The sports dentist works as an individual consultant or as a member of the Sports Medicine Team.\nVeterinary dentistry \u2013 The field of dentistry applied to the care of animals.  It is a specialty of veterinary medicine.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTooth decay was low in pre-agricultural societies, but the advent of farming society about 10,000 years ago correlated with an increase in tooth decay (cavities). An infected tooth from Italy partially cleaned with flint tools, between 13,820 and 14,160 years old, represents the oldest known dentistry, although a 2017 study suggests that 130,000 years ago the Neanderthals already used rudimentary dentistry tools. The Indus valley has yielded evidence of dentistry being practised as far back as 7000 BC, during the Stone Age. The Neolithic site of Mehrgarh (now in Pakistan's south western province of Balochistan ) indicates that this form of dentistry involved curing tooth related disorders with bow drills operated, perhaps, by skilled bead-crafters. The reconstruction of this ancient form of dentistry showed that the methods used were reliable and effective. The earliest dental filling, made of beeswax, was discovered in Slovenia and dates from 6500 years ago. Dentistry was practised in prehistoric Malta, as evidenced by a skull which had an abscess lanced from the root of a tooth dating back to around 2500 BC.An ancient Sumerian text describes a \"tooth worm\" as the cause of dental caries. Evidence of this belief has also been found in ancient India, Egypt, Japan, and China. The legend of the worm is also found in the Homeric Hymns, and as late as the 14th century AD the surgeon Guy de Chauliac still promoted the belief that worms cause tooth decay.Recipes for the treatment of toothache, infections and loose teeth are spread throughout the Ebers Papyrus, Kahun Papyri, Brugsch Papyrus, and Hearst papyrus of Ancient Egypt. The Edwin Smith Papyrus, written in the 17th century BC but which may reflect previous manuscripts from as early as 3000 BC, discusses the treatment of dislocated or fractured jaws. In the 18th century BC, the Code of Hammurabi referenced dental extraction twice as it related to punishment. Examination of the remains of some ancient Egyptians and Greco-Romans reveals early attempts at dental prosthetics. However, it is possible the prosthetics were prepared after death for aesthetic reasons.Ancient Greek scholars Hippocrates and Aristotle wrote about dentistry, including the eruption pattern of teeth, treating decayed teeth and gum disease, extracting teeth with forceps, and using wires to stabilize loose teeth and fractured jaws. Some say the first use of dental appliances or bridges comes from the Etruscans from as early as 700 BC. In ancient Egypt, Hesy-Ra is the first named \"dentist\" (greatest of the teeth). The Egyptians bound replacement teeth together with gold wire. Roman medical writer Cornelius Celsus wrote extensively of oral diseases as well as dental treatments such as narcotic-containing emollients and astringents. The earliest dental amalgams were first documented in a Tang Dynasty medical text written by the Chinese physician Su Kung in 659, and appeared in Germany in 1528.During the Islamic Golden Age Dentistry was discussed in several famous books of medicine such as The Canon in medicine written by Avicenna and Al-Tasreef by Al-Zahrawi who is considered the greatest surgeon of the Middle ages, Avicenna said that jaw fracture should be reduced according to the occlusal guidance of the teeth; this principle is still valid in modern times. while Al-Zahrawi made a lot of surgical tools that resemble the modern tools.\nHistorically, dental extractions have been used to treat a variety of illnesses. During the Middle Ages and throughout the 19th century, dentistry was not a profession in itself, and often dental procedures were performed by barbers or general physicians. Barbers usually limited their practice to extracting teeth which alleviated pain and associated chronic tooth infection. Instruments used for dental extractions date back several centuries. In the 14th century, Guy de Chauliac most probably invented the dental pelican (resembling a pelican's beak) which was used to perform dental extractions up until the late 18th century. The pelican was replaced by the dental key which, in turn, was replaced by modern forceps in the 19th century.\n\nThe first book focused solely on dentistry was the \"Artzney Buchlein\" in 1530, and the first dental textbook written in English was called \"Operator for the Teeth\" by Charles Allen in 1685.In the United Kingdom, there was no formal qualification for the providers of dental treatment until 1859 and it was only in 1921 that the practice of dentistry was limited to those who were professionally qualified. The Royal Commission on the National Health Service in 1979 reported that there were then more than twice as many registered dentists per 10,000 population in the UK than there were in 1921.\n\n\n=== Modern dentistry ===\n\nIt was between 1650 and 1800 that the science of modern dentistry developed. The English physician Thomas Browne in his A Letter to a Friend (c.\u20091656 pub. 1690) made an early dental observation with characteristic humour:\n\nThe Egyptian Mummies that I have seen, have had their Mouths open, and somewhat gaping, which affordeth a good opportunity to view and observe their Teeth, wherein 'tis not easie to find any wanting or decayed: and therefore in Egypt, where one Man practised but one Operation, or the Diseases but of single Parts, it must needs be a barren Profession to confine unto that of drawing of Teeth, and little better than to have been Tooth-drawer unto King Pyrrhus, who had but two in his Head.\nThe French surgeon Pierre Fauchard became known as the \"father of modern dentistry\". Despite the limitations of the primitive surgical instruments during the late 17th and early 18th century, Fauchard was a highly skilled surgeon who made remarkable improvisations of dental instruments, often adapting tools from watchmakers, jewelers and even barbers, that he thought could be used in dentistry. He introduced dental fillings as treatment for dental cavities. He asserted that sugar-derived acids like tartaric acid were responsible for dental decay, and also suggested that tumors surrounding the teeth and in the gums could appear in the later stages of tooth decay.\n\nFauchard was the pioneer of dental prosthesis, and he invented many methods to replace lost teeth. He suggested that substitutes could be made from carved blocks of ivory or bone. He also introduced dental braces, although they were initially made of gold, he discovered that the teeth position could be corrected as the teeth would follow the pattern of the wires. Waxed linen or silk threads were usually employed to fasten the braces. His contributions to the world of dental science consist primarily of his 1728 publication Le chirurgien dentiste or The Surgeon Dentist.  The French text included \"basic oral anatomy and function, dental construction, and various operative and restorative techniques, and effectively separated dentistry from the wider category of surgery\".\n\nAfter Fauchard, the study of dentistry rapidly expanded. Two important books, Natural History of Human Teeth (1771) and Practical Treatise on the Diseases of the Teeth (1778), were published by British surgeon John Hunter. In 1763 he entered into a period of collaboration with the London-based dentist James Spence. He began to theorise about the possibility of tooth transplants from one person to another. He realised that the chances of a successful tooth transplant (initially, at least) would be improved if the donor tooth was as fresh as possible and was matched for size with the recipient.  These principles are still used in the transplantation of internal organs. Hunter conducted a series of pioneering operations, in which he attempted a tooth transplant. Although the donated teeth never properly bonded with the recipients' gums, one of Hunter's patients stated that he had three which lasted for six years, a remarkable achievement for the period.Major advances were made in the 19th century, and dentistry evolved from a trade to a profession. The profession came under government regulation by the end of the 19th century. In the UK the Dentist Act was passed in 1878 and the British Dental Association formed in 1879. In the same year, Francis Brodie Imlach was the first ever dentist to be elected President of the Royal College of Surgeons (Edinburgh), raising dentistry onto a par with clinical surgery for the first time.\n\n\n=== Hazards in modern dentistry ===\n\nLong term occupational noise exposure can contribute to permanent hearing loss, which is referred to as noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and tinnitus. Noise exposure can cause excessive stimulation of the hearing mechanism, which damages the delicate structures of the inner ear. NIHL can occur when an individual is exposed to sound levels above 90 dBA according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Regulations state that the permissible noise exposure levels for individuals is 90 dBA. For the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), exposure limits are set to 85 dBA. Exposures below 85 dBA are not considered to be hazardous. Time limits are placed on how long an individual can stay in an environment above 85 dBA before it causes hearing loss. OSHA places that limitation at 8 hours for 85 dBA. The exposure time becomes shorter as the dBA level increases.\nWithin the field of dentistry, a variety of cleaning tools are used including piezoelectric and sonic scalers, and ultrasonic scalers and cleaners. While a majority of the tools do not exceed 75 dBA, prolonged exposure over many years can lead to hearing loss or complaints of tinnitus. Few dentists have reported using personal hearing protective devices, which could offset any potential hearing loss or tinnitus.\n\n\n=== Evidence-based dentistry ===\n\nThere is a movement in modern dentistry to place a greater emphasis on high-quality scientific evidence in decision-making. Evidence-based dentistry (EBD) uses current scientific evidence to guide decisions. It is an approach to oral health that requires the application and examination of relevant scientific data related to the patient's oral and medical health. Along with the dentist's professional skill and expertise, EBD allows dentists to stay up to date on the latest procedures and patients to receive improved treatment. A new paradigm for medical education designed to incorporate current research into education and practice was developed to help practitioners provide the best care for their patients. It was first introduced by Gordon Guyatt and the Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada in the 1990s. It is part of the larger movement toward evidence-based medicine and other evidence-based practices.\n\n\n== Ethical and medicolegal issues ==\nDentistry is unique in that it requires dental students to have competence-based clinical skills that can only be acquired through specialized laboratory training and direct patient care. This necessitates the need for a scientific and professional basis of care with a foundation of research-based education. The accreditation of dental schools plays a role in enhancing the quality of  dental education.There are controversial articles that are not evidence based and rely on opinions that are published and attract attention.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of dental organizations\nDental aerosol\nDental instrument\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDentistry at Curlie", "chinese_title": "Dental medicine ", "chinese": "Dentistry (French: DentiSterie; English: Dentistry; Stomatology) is a medical research on diagnosis, prevention and treatment, medical research branch of discomfort and condition, generally dealing with dental diseases, but can also include oral mucosa and adjacent Related structures and tissues, especially diamonds (chin and facial) regional diseases. Despite the main dental problems related to teeth, dental fields are not limited to dental science (TOODOLOLOGY, from ancient Greek, \u1f40\u0394\u03cd\u03cd\u03cd, odo\u00fas, \"teeth\") - About study tooth structure, development and malformation Subject. Because there is a lot of overlapping areas, teeth science is often understood to include oral science that is now substantially absent (on studying oral discomfort and disease disciplines), so these two terms can be mutual in some areas. use.\nIt is generally believed that teeth science is important for overall health. Dental treatment is implemented by dental teams, usually including a dentist, several dentist assistants (dentist assistants, oral hygiene, dental techniques and dental therapists). Most dentists work in a private clinic (primary care), and some work in hospital (secondary care) and institution (prison, military base, etc.).\nThe history of teeth is almost as long as human civilization, and it can be traced to 7,000 BC. The original tooth surgery technology can be seen during the ancient Egypt. A piece of mandible in about 2,650 BC has two holes under the first molar root, which shows that the teeth were thrown. In the early Harrapa Times in the Indian River Basin (3300 BC), there was a teeth that were drilled across wells 9,000 ago. Tooth surgery is considered to be the first specialized discipline in medicine.\n\n\n== Dental treatment ==\nTooth science usually contains important services related to the oral cavity. Due to the high-risk and universality of oral diseases, coupled with the incidence of poor higher incidences than other socio-economic groups, oral diseases have become important public health issues. Most dental treatment is to prevent or treat two most common oral diseases, ie dental caries and periodontal disease (gum disease or sepophobuue). Common treatments include dental repair, teeth and surgery tooth extraction, tolume removal and rootenulation.\nAll American dentists have received at least three years of undergraduate education, almost all of the bachelor's degree. In addition, the dental school is eligible for the past four years to become Dr. DDS (DDS) or Dr. DDS (DMD). Dentists need to complete additional qualifications or continuing education to perform complicated treatment such as sedation, oral and maxillofacial surgery and planting teeth.\nThrough ordinary training, they can perform most dental treatment, such as repair treatment (filler, crown, wet bridge), prosthesis (fake teeth), dental marrow (root canal) treatment, periodontal (gum) treatment, tooth extraction, and Check, image check (X-rays) and diagnostics. Dentists can also issue prescription drugs such as antibiotics, sedatives, and any other drugs for healing patients.\nThe dentist also encourages professional cleaning and assessment through appropriate personal hygiene, and twice a year, to prevent oral disease. The oral condition will reflect systemic diseases such as osteoporosis, diabetes or cancer. Many studies also show that gum disease increases the risk of diabetes, heart disease and premature birth.\n\n\n== Education and license ==\n\nDr. John M. Harris opened the world's first dental school in Bangbridge, Ohio, and helped establish dental establishment into a health career. The school opened on February 21, 1828 and is now the Harris dental museum. In 1840, the first tooth academy, Baltimore Surgery was opened in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. Philandelphia Dental College was built in 1863 and is the second dental school in the United States. In 1907, the Tandple University accepted the request to incorporate the Philadelphia Dental College.\nStudies have shown that graduated from different countries or even a dentist who graduated from different dental schools in a country, there may be different clinical decisions for the same clinical situation. For example, the dentist who graduated from the Israeli tooth Science school is more often recommended to unlock the unscrupulous influence of the third molar (wisdom tooth) than graduated from the dentist who graduated from Latin America or Eastern Europe. In the United Kingdom, the British \"Dentals\" and the \"Dentist Registration Law\" in 1879 restrictions will grant qualified and registered practitioners in the title of \"Dentals\" and \"Dental Doctors\". However, others can legally call themselves as \"dental experts\" or \"dental consultants\". The British dental industry received comprehensive supervision after the \"Dentals Law\" in 1921, which requires any dental practitioners to register. In 1880, the British Dentist Association was founded by John Toms' Association, which plays an important role in prosecut the dentist illegal practice. In South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Finland, Sweden, Brazil, Chile, USA, Canada, etc., Dentist is graduated from Dr. DDS or Dental Dr. (DMD), which is eligible for professional health care workers in the dental industry. This is equivalent to the Dentist / Dietic Science (BDS, BDENT, BCHD, BDSC) granted by the United Kingdom and the United States. In most Western countries, it is necessary to have a qualified dentist usually have to complete postgraduate learning at least four years; countries within the EU require at least five years. Before practicing, dentists usually take five to eight years to complete the study of higher education. Although it is not mandatory, many dentists will choose to complete an internship or inpatient internship that pays attention to dental health care after getting a dental degree.\n\n\n== Specialty ==\n\nSome dentists will receive further training in order to have expertise after obtaining their initial degrees. Dentist registration organization recognizes accurate door based on the location. Examples include:\n\nPublic Health - Study of Epidemiology and Social Health Policy related to oral health.\nDetodopathy (also known as dental mediators) - study root canal treatment and epidus and its surrounding diseases.\nOral and maxillofacial pathology - study, diagnosis, and sometimes the treatment of oral maxillofacial regions.\nOral and Maxillofacial Side - A Study of Image Learning of Oral Crosslinomandromandibular Diseases.\nOral and Maxillofacial Surgery (also known as oral surgery, oral jaw surgery) - research on teeth, plants, and surgical surgery about chin, mouth and face.\nTooth Corrective Study and Maxillofacial Orthopedics - Studies to Correcting Teeth, Central and Mandibular Development in Demonstration.\nPeriodic (also known as periodontal disease) - Treatment of periodontal tissue disease (non-surgical and surgery) and placement and maintenance of dental implants\nPediatric dental (also known as children dental) - Dental against children\nOral repair (also known as a denture repair, oral replenishment, denture patching) - a repair of dentures, bridges and implants. Some oral repair doctors will further carry out \"oral maxillofacial repair\" training, which involves replacing missing facial structures such as ears, eyes, nose, etc.\nDiagnosis, prevention and treatment of dental caries (tooth decay).\nOral Engineering - Clinical Assessment and Diagnosis of Oral Mucosal Diseases.\nSpecial needs tooth science (also known as special care tooth science) - Dental for those with development or after tomorrow.\nOral biology - study of teeth and craniology biology\nForensic Stomatology - Study of Dental Legal Evidence Collection and Using. Any tooth doctors who have experience or trained in this field are competent. The function of the forensic dentist is mainly recorded and verified.\nElderly Dental Medicine - Dental health care for the elderly, including diagnosis, prevention and treatment and normal aging and age-related diseases, as part of an interdisciplinary team containing other professional medical staff.\nVeterinary Dental, a veterinary Medicine - Applying to the Dental Area of \u200b\u200bAnimal Care.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Indian River Basin Civilization (IVC) has evidence that some people are engaged in dental administration 7,000. The Indian River Basin Civilization site located in Mehgergl demonstrated this earliest form of dental, including the treatment of diamond treatment with teeth related to teeth. Maybe this is still operated by a skilled beepmaker. Reconstruction of this ancient form dental indicates that the methods used are reliable and effective. The earliest dental fill was found in Slovenia, 6500, made by beeswax. The Summes in 5,000 BC describes the causes of dental caries into \"tootus\". The evidence of this belief appeared in ancient India, Egypt, Japan and China. The legends of the tootus have also appeared in Homer's work, late 14th century, surgeon, GUY DE CHAULIAC, still believes in toothed tooth. The reel (EBERS PAPYRUS, KAHUN PAPYRI, Brugsch Papyrus, and Hearst Packet PAPYRUS) is widely spread in Ancient Egypt. Edwin Smith, Edwin Smith, who is written in 17th century BC, may reflect several examples of treating dental diseases before 3,000 BC. In the 18th century BC, the \"Hammurabi Code\" mentioned twice as a punishment. Some of the old ancient Egyptians and the Greek Romans revealed the early attempts of dental repair and surgery. But this may also be due to aesthetic reasons to repair after death. Ancient Greek scholar Hippoot and Aristotle wrote an article about dental, including teeth, tooth decay, tooth decay, with pliers tooth extraction, stabilize loose teeth and breaks with wire. Some said that Itriarians used dental correrators and wetches in 700 BC. In ancient Egypt, Hesi-RE is the first person known as \"dentist\" (the greatest teeth). The Egyptian is fixed with a gold wire. The ancient Roman Medical writers Conels Kelish wrote a large number of works related to oral diseases and dental treatment, such as moisturizing creams and convergents containing anesthetic components. The earliest dental use of mercury alloy appeared in a medical article in the Su Palace of the Chinese Tang Dynasty in 659, in Germany in 1528. Historically, the extraction has been used to treat a variety of diseases. In the Middle Ages and the 19th century, the dental itself is not a professional, and the dental surgery at the time is often handled by a hairdresser or an ordinary doctor. Barber usually only unplug the teeth capable of relieving pain and related chronic teeth infection. The instruments used to extract teeth can be traced back to a few centuries. In the 14th century, Gair was invented to dental \u9e48\u9e55 (similar to \u9e48), until the end of the 18th century is used to pull tooth. Later, the extraction keys replaced the dental \u9e48, the extraction pliers in the 20th century turned to the extraction keys.\nThe first book specially speaking dental book is a \"Artzney Buchlein\" in 1530. The first English-written dental school is written by Charles Allen, 1685, \"Dental\" (Operator for the teeth). In the UK, there is no formal qualified dental treatment provider before 1859 until 1921, dental practice is limited to people with professional qualifications. In 1979, the National Health Services Royal Committee reported that the number of dentals per 10,000 people was twice in 1921.\n\n\n=== Modern dental medicine ===\nModern dental medicine has developed from 1650 to 1800. The British doctor Thomas Brown made an early dental observation in a unique humorous manner in his \"a letter to a friend\" (a letter to a friend):\n\nI have seen the Egyptian Mummy, the mouth, how many spaces, which give me a good opportunity to view the tooth to see their teeth, and it is not easy to find any turning and dental caries in their mouth. Therefore, in the country of Egypt, one person is only responsible for a surgical or single disease. It is only a poor career that is only a poverty tooth. It is only a little bit better than the tricks of King Plus, because he has only two teeth. . French surgeon Pierre Fosal is known for the \"Father of Modern Dental\". There are many restrictions on the late 17th century and the primary surgery tools in the early 18th century. The technical skilled surgeon in Fusal has a significant improvement in dental equipment, often using the watch manufacturer, jeweler, and even hairdressers. He believes that it can also be used for dental tools for improvement. He used tooth filler to treat dental caries for the first time. He asserted that sugar derived acid, such as tartaric acid caused dental caries, and also proposed a lump in the teeth and gums, which may appear in the late stage of tooth decay.\n\nFarl is a pioneer of denture, and he has also invented many methods of substituting the dental teeth. He suggested that the alternative can be a draft of ivory or bone. He also used a tooth for the first time, although they were originally gold, he found that the position of the teeth can be corrected because the teeth will grow along the wire of the wire. Wax linen or silk is usually used to fix the tooth. His contribution to the tooth medical community mainly includes the \"Le Chirurgien Dentiste\" published by his 1728. This approach includes \"basic oral anatomical structure and function, teeth structure, and various surgicals and repair techniques, effectively separating dentistry from a broader class of surgery.\"\n\nAfter Fosal, dental research has developed rapidly. Two important works, \"Natural History of Human Teeth, 1771) and\" Practical Papers of Dental Diseases \", published by British doctors John Hunter. In 1763, he started working with London dentist James Spris. He began to create theory of the possibility of dental transplantation between people. He realized that if the donation is as fresh as possible, and the success rate of the rejection is consistent, then the success rate of the tooth transplant (at least just like this) will increase. These principles are still suitable for transplantation of internal organs. Hunter conducted a series of pioneering surgery and tried to transplant surgery.
