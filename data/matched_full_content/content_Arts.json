{"topic": "arts", "english_title": "The arts", "english": "The arts are a very wide range of human practices of creative expression, storytelling and cultural participation. They encompass multiple diverse and plural modes of thinking, doing and being, in an extremely broad range of media. Both highly dynamic and a characteristically constant feature of human life, they have developed into innovative, stylized and sometimes intricate forms. This is often achieved through sustained and deliberate study, training and/or theorizing within a particular tradition, across generations and even between civilizations.  The arts are a vehicle through which human beings cultivate distinct social, cultural and individual identities, while transmitting values, impressions, judgments, ideas, visions, spiritual meanings, patterns of life and experiences across time and space.\nProminent examples of the arts include architecture, visual arts (including ceramics, drawing, filmmaking, painting, photography, and sculpting), literary arts (including fiction, drama, poetry, and prose), performing arts (including dance, music, and theatre), textiles and fashion, folk art and handicraft, oral storytelling, conceptual and installation art, philosophy, criticism, and culinary arts (including cooking, chocolate making and winemaking). They can employ skill and imagination to produce objects, performances, convey insights and experiences, and construct new environments and spaces.\nThe arts can refer to common, popular or everyday practices as well as more sophisticated and systematic, or institutionalized ones. They can be discrete and self-contained, or combine and interweave with other art forms, such as the combination of artwork with the written word in comics. They can also develop or contribute to some particular aspect of a more complex art form, as in cinematography.\nBy definition, the arts themselves are open to being continually re-defined. The practice of modern art, for example, is a testament to the shifting boundaries, improvisation and experimentation, reflexive nature, and self-criticism or questioning that art and its conditions of production, reception, and possibility can undergo.\nAs both a means of developing capacities of attention and sensitivity, and as ends in themselves, the arts can simultaneously be a form of response to the world, and a way that our responses, and what we deem worthwhile goals or pursuits, are transformed. From prehistoric cave paintings, to ancient and contemporary forms of ritual, to modern-day films, art has served to register, embody and preserve our ever shifting relationships to each other and to the world. \n\n\n== Definition ==\n\nThere are several possible meanings for the definitions of the terms Art and Arts. The first meaning of the word art is \u00ab way of doing \u00bb. The most basic present meaning defines the arts as specific activities that produce sensitivity in humans. The arts are also referred to as bringing together all creative and imaginative activities, without including science. In its most basic abstract definition, art is a documented expression of a sentient being through or on an accessible medium so that anyone can view, hear or experience it. The act itself of producing an expression can also be referred to as a certain art, or as art in general. Whether this solidified expression, or the act of producing it, is \"good\" or has value depends on those who access and rate it. Such public rating is dependent on various subjective factors. Merriam-Webster defines \"the arts\" as \"painting, sculpture, music, theatre, literature, etc., considered as a group of activities done by people with skill and imagination.\" Similarly, the United States Congress, in the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act, defined \"the arts\" as follows:\n\nThe term \"the arts\" includes, but is not limited to, music (instrumental and vocal), dance, drama, folk art, creative writing, architecture and allied fields, painting, sculpture, photography, graphic and craft arts, industrial design, costume and fashion design, motion pictures, television, radio, film, video, tape and sound recording, the arts related to the presentation, performance, execution, and exhibition of such major art forms, all those traditional arts practiced by the diverse peoples of this country. (sic) and the study and application of the arts to the human environment.\nArt is a global activity in which a large number of disciplines are included, such as: fine arts, liberal arts, visual arts, decorative arts, applied arts, design, crafts, performing arts, ... We are talking about \"the arts\" when several of them are mentioned: \"As in all arts the enjoyment increases with the knowledge of the art\".The arts can be divided into several areas, the fine arts which bring together, in the broad sense, all the arts whose aim is to produce true aesthetic pleasure, decorative arts and applied arts which relate to an aesthetic side in everyday life.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest surviving form of any of the arts are cave paintings, possibly from 70,000 BCE, but definitely from at least 40,000 BCE. The oldest known musical instrument, the Divje Babe Flute, is also dated to at least 40,000 BCE, while the earliest surviving literature, the Instructions of Shuruppak and Kesh temple hymn among other Sumerian cuneiform tablets, are thought to only be from 2600 BCE.In Ancient Greece, all art and craft was referred to by the same word, techne. Thus, there was no distinction among the arts. Ancient Greek art brought the veneration of the animal form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions. Ancient Roman art depicted gods as idealized humans, shown with characteristic distinguishing features (e.g. Zeus' thunderbolt). In Byzantine and Gothic art of the Middle Ages, the dominance of the church insisted on the expression of biblical truths. Eastern art has generally worked in a style akin to Western medieval art, namely a concentration on surface patterning and local colour (meaning the plain colour of an object, such as basic red for a red robe, rather than the modulations of that colour brought about by light, shade and reflection). A characteristic of this style is that the local colour is often defined by an outline (a contemporary equivalent is the cartoon). This is evident in, for example, the art of India, Tibet and Japan. Religious Islamic art forbids iconography, and instead expresses religious ideas through calligraphy and geometrical designs.\n\n\n=== Classifications ===\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the Artes Liberales (liberal arts) were taught in universities as part of the Trivium, an introductory curriculum involving grammar, rhetoric, and logic, and of the Quadrivium, a curriculum involving the \"mathematical arts\" of arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy. The Artes Mechanicae (consisting of vestiaria \u2013 tailoring and weaving; agricultura \u2013 agriculture; architectura \u2013 architecture and masonry; militia and venatoria \u2013 warfare, hunting, military education, and the martial arts; mercatura \u2013 trade; coquinaria \u2013 cooking; and metallaria \u2013 blacksmithing and metallurgy) were practised and developed in guild environments. The modern distinction between \"artistic\" and \"non-artistic\" skills did not develop until the Renaissance. In modern academia, the arts are usually grouped with or as a subset of the humanities. Some subjects in the humanities are history, linguistics, literature, theology, philosophy, and logic.\nThe arts have also been classified as seven: painting, architecture, sculpture, literature, music, performing and cinema.\nSome view literature, painting, sculpture, and music as the main four arts, of which the others are derivative; drama is literature with acting, dance is music expressed through motion, and song is music with literature and voice.\n\n\n== Visual arts ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nArchitecture is the art and science of designing buildings and structures. The word architecture comes from the Greek arkhitekton, \"master builder, director of works,\" from \u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03b9- (arkhi) \"chief\" + \u03c4\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd (tekton) \"builder, carpenter\". A wider definition would include the design of the built environment, from the macrolevel of town planning, urban design, and landscape architecture to the microlevel of creating furniture. Architectural design usually must address both feasibility and cost for the builder, as well as function and aesthetics for the user.\n\nIn modern usage, architecture is the art and discipline of creating, or inferring an implied or apparent plan of, a complex object or system. The term can be used to connote the implied architecture of abstract things such as music or mathematics, the apparent architecture of natural things, such as geological formations or the structure of biological cells, or explicitly planned architectures of human-made things such as software, computers, enterprises, and databases, in addition to buildings. In every usage, an architecture may be seen as a subjective mapping from a human perspective (that of the user in the case of abstract or physical artifacts) to the elements or components of some kind of structure or system, which preserves the relationships among the elements or components. Planned architecture manipulates space, volume, texture, light, shadow, or abstract elements in order to achieve pleasing aesthetics. This distinguishes it from applied science or engineering, which usually concentrate more on the functional and feasibility aspects of the design of constructions or structures.\nIn the field of building architecture, the skills demanded of an architect range from the more complex, such as for a hospital or a stadium, to the apparently simpler, such as planning residential houses. Many architectural works may be seen also as cultural and political symbols, or works of art. The role of the architect, though changing, has been central to the successful (and sometimes less than successful) design and implementation of pleasingly built environments in which people live.\n\n\n=== Ceramics ===\n\nCeramic art is art made from ceramic materials (including clay), which may take forms such as pottery, tile, figurines, sculpture, and tableware. While some ceramic products are considered fine art, some are considered to be decorative, industrial, or applied art objects. Ceramics may also be considered artefacts in archaeology. Ceramic art can be made by one person or by a group of people. In a pottery or ceramic factory, a group of people design, manufacture, and decorate the pottery. Products from a pottery are sometimes referred to as \"art pottery.\" In a one-person pottery studio, ceramists or potters produce studio pottery. In modern ceramic engineering usage, \"ceramics\" is the art and science of making objects from inorganic, non-metallic materials by the action of heat. It excludes glass and mosaic made from glass tesserae.\n\n\n=== Conceptual art ===\n\nConceptual art is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work takes precedence over traditional aesthetic and material concerns.\nThe inception of the term in the 1960s referred to a strict and focused practice of idea-based art that often defied traditional visual criteria associated with the visual arts in its presentation as text. Through its association with the Young British Artists and the Turner Prize during the 1990s, its popular usage, particularly in the United Kingdom, developed as a synonym for all contemporary art that does not practise the traditional skills of painting and sculpture.\n\n\n=== Drawing ===\n\nDrawing is a means of making an image, using any of a wide variety of tools and techniques. It generally involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool, or moving a tool across a surface. Common tools are graphite pencils, pen and ink, inked brushes, wax colour pencils, crayons, charcoals, pastels, and markers. Digital tools which can simulate the effects of these are also used. The main techniques used in drawing are line drawing, hatching, crosshatching, random hatching, scribbling, stippling, and blending. An artist who excels in drawing is referred to as a drafter, draftswoman, or draughtsman. Drawing can be used to create art used in cultural industries such as illustrations, comics and animation. Comics are often called the \"ninth art\" (le neuvi\u00e8me art) in Francophone scholarship, adding to the traditional \"Seven Arts\".\n\n\n=== Painting ===\n\nPainting is a mode of creative expression, and can be done in numerous forms. Drawing, gesture (as in gestural painting), composition, narration (as in narrative art), or abstraction (as in abstract art), among other aesthetic modes, may serve to manifest the expressive and conceptual intention of the practitioner. Paintings can be naturalistic and representational (as in a still life or landscape painting), photographic, abstract, narrative, symbolistic (as in Symbolist art), emotive (as in Expressionism), or political in nature (as in Artivism).\nModern painters have extended the practice considerably to include, for example, collage. Collage is not painting in the strict sense since it includes other materials. Some modern painters incorporate different materials such as sand, cement, straw, wood or strands of hair for their artwork texture. Examples of this are the works of Elito Circa, Jean Dubuffet or Anselm Kiefer.\n\n\n=== Photography ===\n\nPhotography as an art form refers to photographs that are created in accordance with the creative vision of the photographer. Art photography stands in contrast to photojournalism, which provides a visual account for news events, and commercial photography, the primary focus of which is to advertise products or services.\n\n\n=== Sculpture ===\n\nSculpture is the branch of the visual arts that operates in three dimensions. It is one of the plastic arts. Durable sculptural processes originally used carving (the removal of material) and modelling (the addition of material, as clay), in stone, metal, ceramics, wood and other materials; but since modernism, shifts in sculptural process led to an almost complete freedom of materials and process. A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving, assembled by welding or modelling, or moulded, or cast.\n\n\n== Literary arts ==\n\nLiterature is literally \"acquaintance with letters\" as in the first sense given in the Oxford English Dictionary. The noun \"literature\" comes from the Latin word littera meaning \"an individual written character (letter).\" The term has generally come to identify a collection of writings, which in Western culture are mainly prose (both fiction and non-fiction), drama and poetry. In much, if not all of the world, the artistic linguistic expression can be oral as well, and include such genres as epic, legend, myth, ballad, other forms of oral poetry, and as folktale. Comics, the combination of drawings or other visual arts with narrating literature, are often called the \"ninth art\" (le neuvi\u00e8me art) in Francophone scholarship.\n\n\n== Performing arts ==\n\nPerforming arts comprise dance, music, theatre, opera, mime, and other art forms in which a human performance is the principal product. Performing arts are distinguished by this performance element in contrast with disciplines such as visual and literary arts where the product is an object that does not require a performance to be observed and experienced. Each discipline in the performing arts is temporal in nature, meaning the product is performed over a period of time. Products are broadly categorized as being either repeatable (for example, by script or score) or improvised for each performance. Artists who participate in these arts in front of an audience are called performers, including actors, magicians, comedians, dancers, musicians, and singers. Performing arts are also supported by the services of other artists or essential workers, such as songwriting and stagecraft. Performers often adapt their appearance with tools such as costume and stage makeup.\n\n\n=== Dance ===\n\nDance (from Old French dancier, of unknown origin) generally refers to human movement either used as a form of expression or presented in a social, spiritual or performance setting. Dance is also used to describe methods of non-verbal communication (see body language) between humans or animals (e.g. bee dance, mating dance), motion in inanimate objects (e.g. the leaves danced in the wind), and certain musical forms or genres. Choreography is the art of making dances, and the person who does this is called a choreographer. Definitions of what constitutes dance are dependent on social, cultural, aesthetic, artistic and moral constraints and range from functional movement (such as Folk dance) to codified, virtuoso techniques such as ballet. In sports, gymnastics, figure skating and synchronized swimming are dance disciplines while Martial arts \"kata\" are often compared to dances.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nMusic is an art form whose medium is sound and silence, occurring in time. Common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, metre, and articulation), dynamics, and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture. The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context. Music ranges from strictly organized compositions (and their reproduction in performance) through improvisational music to aleatoric pieces. Music can be divided into genres and subgenres, although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to individual interpretation, and occasionally controversial. Within \"the arts\", music may be classified as a performing art, a fine art, and auditory art.\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\n\nTheatre or theater (from Greek theatron (\u03b8\u03ad\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd); from theasthai, \"behold\") is the branch of the performing arts concerned with acting out stories in front of an audience using combinations of speech, gesture, music, dance, sound and spectacle \u2013 indeed, any one or more elements of the other performing arts. In addition to the standard narrative dialogue style, theatre takes such forms as opera, ballet, mime, kabuki, classical Indian dance, Chinese opera and mummers' plays.\n\n\n== Multidisciplinary artistic works ==\nAreas exist in which artistic works incorporate multiple artistic fields, such as film, opera and performance art. While opera is often categorized in the performing arts of music, the word itself is Italian for \"works\", because opera combines several artistic disciplines in a singular artistic experience. In a typical traditional opera, the entire work utilizes the following: the sets (visual arts), costumes (fashion), acting (dramatic performing arts), the libretto, or the words/story (literature), and singers and an orchestra (music).\n\nThe composer Richard Wagner recognized the fusion of so many disciplines into a single work of opera, exemplified by his cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen (\"The Ring of the Nibelung\"). He did not use the term opera for his works, but instead Gesamtkunstwerk (\"synthesis of the arts\"), sometimes referred to as \"Music Drama\" in English, emphasizing the literary and theatrical components which were as important as the music. Classical ballet is another form which emerged in the 17th century in which orchestral music is combined with dance.\nOther works in the late 19th, 20th and 21st centuries have fused other disciplines in unique and creative ways, such as performance art. Performance art is a performance over time which combines any number of instruments, objects, and art within a predefined or less well-defined structure, some of which can be improvised. Performance art may be scripted, unscripted, random or carefully organized; even audience participation may occur. John Cage is regarded by many as a performance artist rather than a composer, although he preferred the latter term. He did not compose for traditional ensembles. Cage's composition Living Room Music composed in 1940 is a \"quartet\" for unspecified instruments, really non-melodic objects, which can be found in a living room of a typical house, hence the title.\n\n\n== Other arts ==\nThere is no clear line between art and culture. Cultural fields like gastronomy are sometimes considered as arts.\n\n\n=== Applied arts ===\n\nThe applied arts are the application of design and decoration to everyday, functional, objects to make them aesthetically pleasing. The applied arts includes fields such as industrial design, illustration, and commercial art. The term \"applied art\" is used in distinction to the fine arts, where the latter is defined as arts that aims to produce objects which are beautiful or provide intellectual stimulation but have no primary everyday function. In practice, the two often overlap.\n\n\n=== Video games ===\n\nA debate exists in the fine arts and video game cultures over whether video games can be counted as an art form. Game designer Hideo Kojima professes that video games are a type of service, not an art form, because they are meant to entertain and attempt to entertain as many people as possible, rather than being a single artistic voice (despite Kojima himself being considered a gaming auteur, and the mixed opinions his games typically receive). However, he acknowledged that since video games are made up of artistic elements (for example, the visuals), game designers could be considered museum curators \u2013 not creating artistic pieces, but arranging them in a way that displays their artistry and sells tickets.\nWithin social sciences, cultural economists show how video games playing is conducive to the involvement in more traditional art forms and cultural practices, which suggests the complementarity between video games and the arts.In May 2011, the National Endowment of the Arts included video games in its redefinition of what is considered a \"work of art\" when applying for a grant. In 2012, the Smithsonian American Art Museum presented an exhibit, The Art of the Video Game. Reviews of the exhibit were mixed, including questioning whether video games belong in an art museum.\n\n\n== Arts criticism ==\nArchitecture criticism\nArt criticism\nDance criticism\nFilm criticism\nMusic criticism\nTelevision criticism\nTheatre criticism\nLiterary criticism\n\n\n== See also ==\nArts in education\nThe arts and politics\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to The arts at Wikimedia Commons\nThe arts at the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\nTopic Dictionaries at Oxford Learner's Dictionaries\nDefinition of Art by Lexico", "chinese_title": "Art species ", "chinese": "Art is a manifestation of performance, which will be affected by culture, and art often affects culture. Art is the specific manifestation of people in the inner creative rush. Art can be divided into literature (including poetry, novels, short stories and epic), performance art (including music, dance and drama), cooking art (including baking, chocolate, cooking and wine), media art (including photography) Movie photography, visual art (including sketch, painting, pottery and sculpture). Some artistic plants will combine visual elements and expressions (such as movies) or visual elements and texts (such as comics).\nArt is the way of saying story, and it is also a way of human relationship between its own and the environment. From the prehistoric stone hole, the present movie plays such a function.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAt ancient Greece, the art and craftsmanship is the same word Techne, so it will not distinguish between art and crafts. Ancient Greek art brought the development of the worship and corresponding techniques of animal morphology, using these to show muscle, steady, beautiful and anatomical proportion. Ancient Rome uses people in the myth of Roman to depict ideals and their respective features.\nIn the ancient century European, Byzantine Art and Gothic Art, mainly in the church, emphasizing the Bible rather than the truth of the substance.\nAsia also has their own art, such as Indian art, Tibet art, Japanese art, Chinese art, etc.\nIslam prohibits idol worship, and it is forbidden to draw images of people and animals, so many Islamic art is presented in geometries and calligraphy.\nRenaissance in the 14th to 17th century, like Li Audo Daxievi, Michelangelo has many contributions, and then the artist's creation is no longer limited to Christian ideas. At the end of the 17th century and the 18th century enlightenment, it began to use rationality and physics to depict the world, but later Einstein's relativity, quantum mechanics proposed that Flord's psychology, and unprecedented scientific and technological progress also influence people to the world. Awareness. However, many things in the modern world are also affected by the original tribe of Africa and Oceania, and their media can be high, Picasso's works, as well as artists, futuristic works.\n\n\n== Art classification ==\n\nAmong the university education in the Middle Age, Boya Education is part of the three art (rough introduction, rhetoric, and logic), and a part of four (rough introduction of arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy) . Mechanical Arts (Johannes Sibei Territory in the Ninth Century) is divided into tailors, textile, agriculture, architecture, masonry structure, war and hunting, martial arts, trade, business, cooking, blacksmith, metallurgy Wait, it is implemented and developed in the environment of the guild. I have been the modern \"artistic skill\" and \"non-artistic skills\" from the era of literary revival.\nIn modern academic circles, art will generally be classified in humanities. There will be a column in the newspaper, it is an artistic message.\nTraditionally, the art will be divided into the following seven categories: architecture, sculpture, painting, music, poetry, dance, drama / movie, now sometimes add photography and comics.\n\n\n== Visual art ==\n\n\n=== Sketch ===\n\nSketch is a way to draw images, you can use many different tools and techniques. The specific way to draw images may be to apply a pressure on the surface of another object, or by a tool is moved on the surface of another object. Common sketch tools include graphite pencils, pen, brush, color pencil, crayon, charcoal, pastel, and microphone writing. You can also use a digital tool to simulate the effects of these drawing. Sketch is mainly used in the drawing line, the shadow, crossover line, random broth, graffiti, drawings, and combinations. Sketch will also be used when creating cartoons and animations.\n\n\n=== Painting ===\n\nPainting is painted on the field means paints containing pigments and binders in objects (such as paper, canvas, wooden boards or walls). However, in the perspective of art, painting refers to the above-mentioned activities with sketch, composition and other aesthetic works, with the aim of reflecting the expression of the painter and its conceptual discussion. Painting can also be used to express spiritual themes and ideas, like this painting from the paint of myths to the picture of Sistine Chapel.\nColor is the essence of painting, just like the sound is the essence of music. Color is quite subjective, there is a psychological impact on people, but some psychological effects will be different with culture. In the Western black is a representative of mourning, but under some cultural, the white represents condolences. Some painters, researchers, writers and scientists (such as high, Newton, Wasi Coniferski) have their own color theory. Even the color expressed in language is just an abstract color, such as red, can represent many and pure red derivatives, with different brightness and color. There is a note on music as a well-known way to represent a high-speed approach, such as C or C #, but in color, there is no use, recognized, a system-defined system (there is a Pantone system in industrial design. definition).\nModern artists have extends painting, such as, for example, collage. This is started by three-dimensionalism, and it may not be painted in a rigorous definition of painting. Some modern artists are also integrated with different materials, such as sand, cement, straw or wood, because of different material textures. Like the Dubi or Asem Katfe work is an example of such a class.\nModern art and contemporary art have turned art center from the historical value of the process to its concept, so some comments believe that paintings in the form of rigorous and art have been dead, but this does not affect the artwork application painting on its art.\n\n\n=== Pottery ===\n\nPottery refers to art based on ceramics (including clay), including pottery, porcelain, tiled brick tile, humanoid, sculpture and tableware. About pottery products are regarded as art, while others are considered as arts, industrial design or application art. There are also many relics of pottery in archeology. Ceramic art can be made of one person or in a group of people. In the ceramic factory, it will be designed, produced and beautified ceramic arts in a group of people. Pottery is sometimes called art ceramics. In the personal ceramic studio, pottery products will be made from pottery houses. In modern ceramic engineering, ceramic refers to the process of treating inorganic, non-metallic materials using heating, to produce a finished product, but glass and glass-based inlaid art is not within the range of ceramics.\n\n\n=== Photography ===\nArt photography is the artistic creation of photographers because of their ideas, with photos presented. Art photography and different news photography in order to provide news related photos, and is also different from commercial photography for marketing products or services.\n\n\n=== Building ===\n\nThe building is the art and science of designing buildings and wooden soil structures. CAo-building definitions include the design of the construction environment, from the giant city planning, urban design and landscape design, to microscopic furniture design. On the one hand, architectural design is required to consider the feasibility and cost of construction construction, and it is also necessary to consider the functionality of users and the aesthetic feelings.\n\nArchitectural Planning is for the need for aesthetics to handle space, volume, texture, light, shadow, etc.\nIn the field of architecture, architects need skills from the design of complex structures such as hospitals and stadiums, to relatively simple home design. Many buildings will also be considered as cultural and political symbols, and they may be considered art. Although the role of the architect has been changing, it is still a key person that can be designed and implemented in successful buildings.\n\n\n=== Sculpture ===\n\nSculpture is one of visual art, mainly in space, is the art of style. Sculptures are generally included in rock, metal, ceramic, wood and other materials (process of removing material) and shape (process of adding materials, such as adding clay). However, modernism will have a larger degree of freedom of sculpture, and various materials can be used to remove materials in a variety of materials, or the material can also be used in welding, molding, molding, or casting.\n\n\n=== Conceptual art ===\n\nThe word art has appeared in the 1960s, and the idea of \u200b\u200bthe idea is more important than the materiality or even traditional aesthetics in the work. In the 1990s, the relationship between the British Youth Artists in the 1990s, the conceptual art is quite popular in the UK, and has become a synonym of art in contemporary art, no art of painting and sculpture. But contemporary art also opposes the art, such as anti-conceptism.\n\n\n== Literary art ==\n\nThe word LITERATURE is from Littera from Latin, which means \"individual handwritten text\". This word is later used to represent many collections, including prose (fictional works and non-virtual works), scripts and poems in the West. The expression of art language in many places can also be oral literature, and can also be epic, legend, myth, rumors and folk stories.\nComics combines painting (or other visual art) and the description of the text, called \"ninth art\" in FrancoPhone scholarship.\n\n\n== Performance Art ==\n\nPerforming art includes dance, music, drama, opera, melt, and other people's performances for its main ingredients. Performing art is classified in its performance, and the art of visual art and literature is different. The two art will have output art (or article), and it is necessary to experience and observe the way through performances. Performing art has its temporary characteristics, that is, performance will only last for a while. Performing art can be divided into repetitive (content arranged according to script or prior art) or an impromptu performance. Artists participating in the performance art called performers, including actors, magicians, comedians, dancers, musicians and singers. Performing art also requires other artists or professional support, such as morphologists and technology theater. Performers sometimes need to adjust their appearance with makeup or clothing.\nPerforming art can be seen as special art, an artist presenting art in front of the audience.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nMusic is the art of sound as a medium. The common elements in music have sound high (and the melody and the sound), the rhythm (and related speed, beats and connection), strong strength, tone and fabric. The creation, performance, importance of music is even different from culture and social background. Some music has a strict organization (you can also reproduce perfect during performance), and some music is an impromptu music present in any form. Music can distinguish between its genre and other styles, but the boundary lines of different genres are often quite subtle, sometimes because of individual interpretation, occasionally controversial. In art, music can be classified as performance art, exquisite art and auditory art.\n\n\n=== drama ===\n\nThe theater art is a kind of performance art in the performance of art, which is a performance art composed of its acting in his audience, and then cooperate with voice, gestures, music, dance, sound and scene. In addition to narrative conversational drama, there are many different forms, such as opera, ballet, melt, kabuki, Indian-style dance and Chinese opera.\n\n\n=== Dance ===\n\nDance generally refers to human beings to social, spiritual or physical movements, may cooperate with music, or there may be no music. Can be carried out one person or in two or more people. Dance is also a way of man release stress.\nSometimes use dance to describe human non-verbal communication (limb language) or even body language (such as bees, or specific music style (dance music).\nBoncing is the art of arranging dance, and people who have searched dance are generally called choreographers.\nThe definition and composition of dance will be different from social, cultural, aesthetics, art, and morality, can have a diverted work as national dance, or can be arranged like a ballet, and it is necessary to show the performance of limb skills. In sports, gymnastics, pattern skating and pattern swimming are also related to dance. Comparison of models in martial arts and dances.\n\n\n== Cross-domain art work ==\n\nSome art species will span several different art, such as movies, opera and performance art. Like operas generally classify performance art in the music field, but the original meaning of Opera is \"work\", because the opera integrates many different art fields in a performance. In a typical opera, we will integrate the panoramic (visual art), clothing (fashion), actors (drama performance art), words and script (literature), singing and symphony orchestra (music). Composer Hua Gener realized that there are many different art fields in the opera. In his work \"Nibongen's ring\", he did not use the name of Opera (Opera), but using GESAMTKUNSTWERK (overall artwork) Name, emphasizing the elements and music of its literature and theater. Classic ballet began in the 19th century and is also an example of music and dance.\nAt the end of the 19th century, in the twentieth century, there are other art species to fuse in unique, creative ways, such as behavioral art. Behavioral art is a binding time, location, behavioral artist, and performing ways to communicate with the audience, unworthy from any other restrictions.
