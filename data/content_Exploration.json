{"topic": "Exploration", "english_title": "Exploration", "english": "Exploration is the act of searching for the purpose of discovery of information or resources. Exploration occurs in all non-sessile animal species, including humans. In human history, its most dramatic rise was during the Age of Discovery when European explorers sailed and charted much of the rest of the world for a variety of reasons. Since then, major explorations after the Age of Discovery have occurred for reasons mostly aimed at information discovery.\n\n\n== Notable periods of human exploration ==\n\n\n=== Phoenician galley sailings ===\nThe Phoenicians (1550 BCE\u2013300 BCE) traded throughout the Mediterranean Sea and Asia Minor though many of their routes are still unknown today. The presence of tin in some Phoenician artifacts suggests that they may have traveled to Britain. According to Virgil's Aeneid and other ancient sources, the legendary Queen Dido was a Phoenician from Tyre who sailed to North Africa and founded the city of Carthage.\n\n\n==== Carthaginean exploration of Western Africa ====\nHanno the Navigator (500 BC), a Carthaginean navigator who explored the Western Coast of Africa.\n\n\n=== Greek & Roman exploration of Northern Europe and Thule ===\nThe Greek explorer from Marseille, Pytheas (380 \u2013 c. 310 BC) was the first to circumnavigate Great Britain, explore Germany, and reach Thule (most commonly thought to be the Shetland Islands or Iceland).\nRomans -under Augustus emperor- reached and explored all the Baltic Sea\n\n\n=== Roman explorations ===\nAfrica ExplorationThe Romans organized expeditions to cross the Sahara desert with five different routes:\n\nthrough the western Sahara, toward the Niger river and actual Timbuktu.\nthrough the Tibesti mountains, toward Lake Chad and actual Nigeria\nthrough the Nile river, toward actual Uganda.\nthough the western coast of Africa, toward the Canary Islands and the Cape Verde islands.\nthrough the Red Sea, toward actual Somalia and perhaps Tanzania.All these expeditions were supported by legionaries and had mainly a commercial purpose. Only the one done by emperor Nero seemed to be a preparative for the conquest of Ethiopia or Nubia: in 62 AD two legionaries explored the sources of the Nile river.\nOne of the main reasons of the explorations was to get gold using the camel to transport it.The explorations near the African western and eastern coasts were supported by Roman ships and deeply related to the naval commerce (mainly toward the Indian Ocean).\nThe Romans also organized several explorations into Northern Europe, and explored as far as China in Asia.\n\n30 BC-640 AD\nWith the acquisition of Ptolemaic Egypt, The Romans begin trading with India. The Empire now has a direct connection to the Spice trade Egypt had established beginning in 118 BC.100 AD-166 AD\nRomano-Chinese relations begin. Ptolemy writes of the Golden Chersonese (i.e. Malay Peninsula) and the trade port of Kattigara, now identified as \u00d3c Eo in northern Vietnam, then part of Jiaozhou, a province of the Chinese Han Empire. The Chinese historical texts describe Roman embassies, from a land they called Daqin.2nd century\nRoman traders reach Siam, Cambodia, Sumatra, and Java.161\nAn embassy from Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius or his successor Marcus Aurelius reaches Chinese Emperor Huan of Han at Luoyang.226\nA Roman diplomat or merchant lands in northern Vietnam and visits Nanjing, China and the court of Sun Quan, ruler of Eastern Wu\n\n\n=== Chinese exploration of Central Asia ===\nDuring the 2nd century BC, the Han dynasty explored much of the Eastern Northern Hemisphere. Starting in 139 BC, the Han diplomat Zhang Qian traveled west in an unsuccessful attempt to secure an alliance with the Da Yuezhi against the Xiongnu (the Yuezhi had been evicted from Gansu by the Xiongnu in 177 BC); however, Zhang's travels discovered entire countries which the Chinese were unaware of, including the remnants of the conquests of Alexander the Great (r. 336\u2013323 BC). When Zhang returned to China in 125 BC, he reported on his visits to Dayuan (Fergana), Kangju (Sogdiana), and Daxia (Bactria, formerly the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom which had just been subjugated by the Da Yuezhi). Zhang described Dayuan and Daxia as agricultural and urban countries like China, and although he did not venture there, described Shendu (the Indus River valley of Northwestern India) and Anxi (Arsacid territories) further west.\n\n\n=== Viking Age ===\n\nFrom about 800 AD to 1040 AD, the Vikings explored Iceland and much of the Western Northern Hemisphere via rivers and oceans. For example, it is known that the Norwegian Viking explorer, Erik the Red (950\u20131003), sailed to and settled in Greenland after being expelled from Iceland, while his son, the Icelandic explorer Leif Ericson (980\u20131020), reached Newfoundland and the nearby North American coast, and is believed to be the first European to land in North America.\n\n\n=== Polynesian Age ===\n\nPolynesians were a maritime people, who populated and explored the central and south Pacific for around 5,000 years, up to about 1280 when they discovered New Zealand. The key invention to their exploration was the outrigger canoe, which provided a swift and stable platform for carrying goods and people. Based on limited evidence, it is thought that the voyage to New Zealand was deliberate. It is unknown if one or more boats went to New Zealand, or the type of boat, or the names of those who migrated. 2011 studies at Wairau Bar in New Zealand show a high probability that one origin was Ruahine Island in the Society Islands. Polynesians may have used the prevailing north easterly trade winds to reach New Zealand in about three weeks. The Cook Islands are in direct line along the migration path and may have been an intermediate stopping point. There are cultural and language similarities between Cook Islanders and New Zealand Maori. Early Maori had different legends of their origins, but the stories were misunderstood and reinterpreted in confused written accounts by early European historians in New Zealand trying to present a coherent pattern of Maori settlement in New Zealand.\nMathematical modelling based on DNA genome studies, using state-of-the-art techniques, have shown that a large number of Polynesian migrants (100\u2013200), including women, arrived in New Zealand around the same time, in about 1280. Otago University studies have tried to link distinctive DNA teeth patterns, which show special dietary influence, with places in or nearby the Society Islands.\n\n\n=== Chinese exploration of the Indian Ocean ===\nThe Chinese explorer, Wang Dayuan (fl. 1311\u20131350) made two major trips by ship to the Indian Ocean. During 1328\u20131333, he sailed along the South China Sea and visited many places in Southeast Asia and reached as far as South Asia, landing in Sri Lanka and India, and he even went to Australia. Then in 1334\u20131339, he visited North Africa and East Africa. Later, the Chinese admiral Zheng He (1371\u20131433) made seven voyages to Arabia, East Africa, India, Indonesia and Thailand.\n\n\n=== European Age of Discovery ===\n\nThe Age of Discovery, also known as the Age of Exploration, is one of the most important periods of geographical exploration in human history. It started in the early 15th century and lasted until the 17th century. In that period, Europeans discovered and/or explored vast areas of the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania. Portugal and Spain dominated the first stages of exploration, while other European nations followed, such as England, Netherlands, and France.\n\nImportant explorations during this period went to a number of continents and regions around the globe. In Africa, important explorers of this period include Diogo C\u00e3o (c.1452 \u2013c.1486) who discovered and ascended the Congo River and reached the coasts of the present-day Angola and Namibia; Bartolomeu Dias (c. 1450\u20131500), who was the first European to reach the Cape of Good Hope and other parts of the South African coast.\nExplorers of routes from Europe towards Asia, the Indian Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean, include Vasco da Gama (1460\u20131524), a navigator who made the first trip from Europe to India and back by the Cape of Good Hope, discovering the ocean route to the East; Pedro Alvares Cabral (c. 1467/68\u2013c.1520) who, following the path of Gama, claimed Brazil and led the first expedition that linked Europe, Africa, America, and Asia; Diogo Dias, who discovered the eastern coast of Madagascar and rounded the corner of Africa; explorers such as Diogo Fernandes Pereira and Pedro Mascarenhas (1470\u20131555), among others, who discovered and mapped the Mascarene Islands and other archipelagos.\nAnt\u00f3nio de Abreu (c.1480\u2013c.1514) and Francisco Serr\u00e3o (14?\u20131521) led the first direct European fleet into the Pacific Ocean (on its western edges), through the Sunda Islands, reaching the Moluccas. Andres de Urdaneta (1498\u20131568) discovered the maritime route from Asia to the Americas.\nIn the Pacific Ocean, Jorge de Menezes (c. 1498\u2013?), discovered Papua New Guinea. Garc\u00eda Jofre de Loa\u00edsa (1490\u20131526), discovered the Marshall Islands.\n\nDiscovery of AmericaExplorations of the Americas began with the initial discovery of America by Christopher Columbus (1451\u20131506), who led a Castilian (Spanish) expedition across the Atlantic, discovering America. After the discovery of America by Columbus, a number of important expeditions were sent out to explore the Western Hemisphere. This included Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n (1474\u20131521), who discovered and mapped the coast of Florida; Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa (c. 1475\u20131519), who was the first European to view the Pacific Ocean from American shores (after crossing the Isthmus of Panama) confirming that America was a separate continent from Asia; Aleixo Garcia (14?\u20131527), who explored the territories of present-day southern Brazil, Paraguay and Bolivia, crossing the Chaco and reaching the Andes (near Sucre).\n\u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca (1490\u20131558) discovered the Mississippi River and was the first European to sail the Gulf of Mexico and cross Texas. Jacques Cartier (1491\u20131557) drew the first maps of part of central and maritime Canada; Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado (1510\u20131554) discovered the Grand Canyon and the Colorado River; Francisco de Orellana (1511\u20131546) was the first European to navigate the length of the Amazon River.\n\nFurther explorationsFerdinand Magellan (1480\u20131521), was the first navigator to cross the Pacific Ocean, discovering the Strait of Magellan, the Tuamotus and Mariana Islands, and achieving a nearly complete circumnavigation of the Earth, in multiple voyages, for the first time. Juan Sebastian Elcano (1476\u20131526), completed the first global circumnavigation.\nIn the second half of the 16th century and the 17th century exploration of Asia and the Pacific Ocean continued with explorers such as Andr\u00e9s de Urdaneta (1498\u20131568), who discovered the maritime route from Asia to the Americas; Pedro Fernandes de Queir\u00f3s (1565\u20131614), who discovered the Pitcairn Islands and the Vanuatu archipelago; \u00c1lvaro de Menda\u00f1a (1542\u20131595), who discovered the Tuvalu archipelago, the Marquesas, the Solomon Islands and Wake Island.\nExplorers of Australia included Willem Janszoon (1570\u20131630), who made the first recorded European landing in Australia; Y\u00f1igo Ortiz de Retez, who discovered and reached eastern and northern New Guinea; Luis V\u00e1ez de Torres (1565\u20131613), who discovered the Torres Strait between Australia and New Guinea; Abel Tasman (1603\u20131659), who explored North Australia, discovered Tasmania, New Zealand and Tongatapu.\nIn North America, major explorers included Henry Hudson (156?\u20131611), who explored the Hudson Bay in Canada; Samuel de Champlain (1574\u20131635), who explored St. Lawrence River and the Great Lakes (in Canada and northern United States); and Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle (1643\u20131687), who explored the Great Lakes region of the United States and Canada, and the entire length of the Mississippi River.\n\n\n=== The Modern Age ===\n\nLong after the golden age of discovery, other explorers completed the world map, such as various Russians explorers, reaching the Siberian Pacific coast and the Bering Strait, at the extreme edge of Asia and Alaska (North America); Vitus Bering (1681\u20131741) who in the service of the Russian Navy, explored the Bering Strait, the Bering Sea, the North American coast of Alaska, and some other northern areas of the Pacific Ocean; and James Cook, who explored the east coast of Australia, the Hawaiian Islands, and circumnavigated the Antarctic continent.\nThere were still significant explorations which occurred well into the modern age. This includes the Lewis and Clark expedition (1804-1806), an overland expedition dispatched by President Thomas Jefferson to explore the newly acquired Louisiana Purchase and to find an interior aquatic route to the Pacific Ocean, along with other objectives to examine the flora and fauna of the continent. In 1818, the British researcher Sir John Ross was the first to find that the deep sea is inhabited by life when catching jellyfish and worms in about 2,000 m (6,562 ft) depth with a special device. The United States Exploring Expedition (1838-1842) was an expedition sent by President Andrew Jackson, in order to survey the Pacific Ocean and surrounding lands.\nThe extreme conditions in the deep sea require elaborate methods and technologies to endure them. In the 20th century, deep-sea exploration advanced considerably through a series of technological inventions, ranging from the sonar system, which can detect the presence of objects underwater through the use of sound, to manned deep-diving submersibles. In 1960, Jacques Piccard and United States Navy Lieutenant Donald Walsh descended in the bathyscaphe Trieste into the deepest part of the world's oceans, the Mariana Trench. In 2018, DSV Limiting Factor, piloted by Victor Vescovo, completed the first mission to the deepest point of the Atlantic Ocean, diving 8,375 m (27,477 ft) below the ocean surface to the base of the Puerto Rico Trench. With the advent of satellite imagery and aviation, exploration of the surface of Earth has largely ceased, however the culture of many disconnected tribes still remain undocumented and left to be explored. Urban exploration is the exploration of manmade structures, usually abandoned ruins or hidden components of the manmade environment.\n\n\n=== Space exploration ===\n\nSpace exploration started in the 20th century with the invention of exo-atmospheric rockets.  This has given humans the opportunity to travel to the Moon, and to send robotic explorers to other planets and far beyond.\nBoth of the Voyager probes have left the Solar System, bearing imprinted gold discs with multiple data types.\n\n\n== Behavioral trait ==\n\nA 2015 study, performed on mobile phone data and on GPS tracks of private vehicles in Italy, demonstrated that individuals naturally split into two well-defined categories according to their mobility habits, dubbed \"returners\" and \"explorers\". \n\"Explorers\" showed a star-like mobility pattern: they have a central core of locations (composed by home and work places) around which distant core of locations gravitates.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Works cited ===\ndi Cosmo, Nicola (2002), Ancient China and Its Enemies: The Rise of Nomadic Power in East Asian History, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, ISBN 978-0-521-77064-4\nMorton, William Scott; Lewis, Charlton M.
