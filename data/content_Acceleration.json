{"topic": "Acceleration", "english_title": "Acceleration", "english": "In mechanics, acceleration is the rate of change of the velocity of an object with respect to time.\nAccelerations are vector quantities (in that they have magnitude and direction). The orientation of an object's acceleration is given by the orientation of the net force acting on that object.  The magnitude of an object's acceleration, as described by Newton's Second Law, is the combined effect of two causes:\n\nthe net balance of all external forces acting onto that object \u2014 magnitude is directly proportional to this net resulting force;\nthat object's mass, depending on the materials out of which it is made \u2014 magnitude is inversely proportional to the object's mass.The SI unit for acceleration is metre per second squared (m\u22c5s\u22122, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              m\n              \n                s\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {\\operatorname {m} }{\\operatorname {s} ^{2}}}}\n  ).\nFor example, when a vehicle starts from a standstill (zero velocity, in an inertial frame of reference) and travels in a straight line at increasing speeds, it is accelerating in the direction of travel.  If the vehicle turns, an acceleration occurs toward the new direction and changes its motion vector.  The acceleration of the vehicle in its current direction of motion is called a linear (or tangential during circular motions) acceleration, the reaction to which the passengers on board experience as a force pushing them back into their seats.  When changing direction, the effecting acceleration is called radial (or orthogonal during circular motions) acceleration, the reaction to which the passengers experience as a centrifugal force.  If the speed of the vehicle decreases, this is an acceleration in the opposite direction and mathematically a negative, sometimes called deceleration, and passengers experience the reaction to deceleration as an inertial force pushing them forward.  Such negative accelerations are often achieved by retrorocket burning in spacecraft.  Both acceleration and deceleration are treated the same, they are both changes in velocity.  Each of these accelerations (tangential, radial, deceleration) is felt by passengers until their relative (differential) velocity are neutralized in reference to the vehicle.  \na=d\\dt v\n\n\n== Definition and properties ==\n\n\n=== Average acceleration ===\n\nAn object's average acceleration over a period of time is its change in velocity \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \u0394\n        \n          v\n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (\\Delta \\mathbf {v} )}\n   divided by the duration of the period \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \u0394\n        t\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (\\Delta t)}\n  .

The SI unit of acceleration is the metre per second squared (m s\u22122); or \"metre per second per second\", as the velocity in metres per second changes by the acceleration value, every second.\n\n\n=== Other forms ===\nAn object moving in a circular motion\u2014such as a satellite orbiting the Earth\u2014is accelerating due to the change of direction of motion, although its speed may be constant. In this case it is said to be undergoing centripetal (directed towards the center) acceleration.\nProper acceleration, the acceleration of a body relative to a free-fall condition, is measured by an instrument called an accelerometer.\nIn classical mechanics, for a body with constant mass, the (vector) acceleration of the body's center of mass is proportional to the net force vector (i.e. sum of all forces) acting on it (Newton's second law):\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          F\n        \n        =\n        m\n        \n          a\n        \n        \n        \u2192\n        \n        \n          a\n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              F\n            \n            m\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {F} =m\\mathbf {a} \\quad \\to \\quad \\mathbf {a} ={\\frac {\\mathbf {F} }{m}}}\n  where F is the net force acting on the body, m is  the mass of the body, and a is the center-of-mass acceleration.

These components are called the tangential acceleration and the normal or radial acceleration (or centripetal acceleration in circular motion, see also circular motion and centripetal force).\nGeometrical analysis of three-dimensional space curves, which explains tangent, (principal) normal and binormal, is described by the Frenet\u2013Serret formulas.\n\n\n== Special cases ==\n\n\n=== Uniform acceleration ===\n\nUniform or constant acceleration is a type of motion in which the velocity of an object changes by an equal amount in every equal time period.\nA frequently cited example of uniform acceleration is that of an object in free fall in a uniform gravitational field. The acceleration of a falling body in the absence of resistances to motion is dependent only on the gravitational field strength g (also called acceleration due to gravity).

As Galileo showed, the net result is parabolic motion, which describes, e. g., the trajectory of a projectile in a vacuum near the surface of Earth.\n\n\n=== Circular motion ===\n\nIn uniform circular motion, that is moving with constant speed along a circular path, a particle experiences an acceleration resulting from the change of the direction of the velocity vector, while its magnitude remains constant. The derivative of the location of a point on a curve with respect to time, i.e. its velocity, turns out to be always exactly tangential to the curve, respectively orthogonal to the radius in this point. Since in uniform motion the velocity in the tangential direction does not change, the acceleration must be in radial direction, pointing to the center of the circle. This acceleration constantly changes the direction of the velocity to be tangent in the neighboring point, thereby rotating the velocity vector along the circle.\n\u2022 For a given speed \n  \n    \n      \n        v\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v}\n  , the magnitude of this geometrically caused acceleration (centripetal acceleration) is inversely proportional to the radius \n  \n    \n      \n        r\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle r}\n   of the circle, and increases as the square of this speed:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          a\n          \n            c\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              v\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            r\n          \n        \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a_{c}={\\frac {v^{2}}{r}}\\;.}\n  \u2022 Note that, for a given angular velocity \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c9\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\omega }\n  , the centripetal acceleration is directly proportional to radius \n  \n    \n      \n        r\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle r}\n  .

Newtonian mechanics is exactly revealed to be an approximation to reality, valid to great accuracy at lower speeds. As the relevant speeds increase toward the speed of light, acceleration no longer follows classical equations.\nAs speeds approach that of light, the acceleration produced by a given force decreases, becoming infinitesimally small as light speed is approached; an object with mass can approach this speed asymptotically, but never reach it.\n\n\n=== General relativity ===\n\nUnless the state of motion of an object is known, it is impossible to distinguish whether an observed force is due to gravity or to acceleration\u2014gravity and inertial acceleration have identical effects. Albert Einstein called this the equivalence principle, and said that only observers who feel no force at all\u2014including the force of gravity\u2014are justified in concluding that they are not accelerating.\n\n\n== Conversions ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAcceleration Calculator Simple acceleration unit converter\nAcceleration Calculator Acceleration Conversion calculator converts units form meter per second square, kilometer per second square, millimeter per second square & more with metric conversion.", "chinese_title": "", "chinese": ""}
