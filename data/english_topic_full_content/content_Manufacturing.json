{"topic": "Manufacturing", "english_title": "Manufacturing", "english": "Manufacturing is the production of goods through the use of labor, machines, tools, and chemical or biological processing or formulation. It is the essence of secondary sector of the economy. The term may refer to a range of human activity, from handicraft to high-tech, but it is most commonly applied to industrial design, in which raw materials from the primary sector are transformed into finished goods on a large scale. Such goods may be sold to other manufacturers for the production of other more complex products (such as aircraft, household appliances, furniture, sports equipment or automobiles), or distributed via the tertiary industry to end users and consumers (usually through wholesalers, who in turn sell to retailers, who then sell them to individual customers).\nManufacturing engineering, or the manufacturing process, are the steps through which raw materials are transformed into a final product. The manufacturing process begins with the product design, and materials specification from which the product is made. These materials are then modified through manufacturing processes to become the required part.\nModern manufacturing includes all intermediate processes required in the production and integration of a product's components. Some industries, such as semiconductor and steel manufacturers, use the term fabrication instead.\nThe manufacturing sector is closely connected with the engineering and industrial design. Examples of major manufacturers in North America include General Motors Corporation, General Electric, Procter & Gamble, AbbVie, Unilever, General Dynamics, Boeing, Pfizer, Precision Castparts, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Examples in Europe include Volkswagen Group, Siemens, BASF and Michelin. Examples in Asia include Toyota, Yamaha, Panasonic, LG, Samsung, Godrej & Boyce and Tata Motors.\n\n\n== History and development ==\n\nManufacturing began in the 19th century. It was usually carried out by single skilled artisans with assistants. Training was by apprenticeship. In much of the pre-industrial world, the guild system protected the privileges and trade secrets of urban artisans.\nIn the pre-industrial world, most manufacturing occurred in rural areas, where household-based manufacturing served as a supplemental subsistence strategy to agriculture (and continues to do so in places). Entrepreneurs organized a number of manufacturing households into a single enterprise through the putting-out system.\nThe factory system was first adopted in Britain at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th century and later spread around the world. The main characteristic of the factory system is the use of machinery, originally powered by water or steam and later by electricity. Increased use of economies of scale, the centralization of factories, and standardization of interchangeable parts were adopted in the American system of manufacturing in the nineteenth century.\nThe mechanized assembly line was introduced to assemble parts in a repeatable fashion, with individual workers performing specific steps during the process. This led to significant increases in efficiency, lowering the cost of the end process. Later, automation was introduced to incrementally replace human operators, a trend that has accelerated with the development of the computer and the robot.\nManufacturing in the Soviet Union was based on collectivism.\n\n\n=== Manufacturing systems: methods of manufacturing ===\nAgile manufacturing\nFabrication\nFlexible manufacturing\nJust-in-time manufacturing\nLean manufacturing\nManufacturing engineering\nMass customization\nMass production\nNumerical control\nPrefabrication\nRapid manufacturing\nReconfigurable manufacturing system\nHigh performance positioning system\n\n\n== Industrial policy ==\n\n\n=== Economics of manufacturing ===\nEmerging technologies have provided some new growth in advanced manufacturing employment opportunities in the Manufacturing Belt in the United States. Manufacturing provides important material support for national infrastructure and for national defense.\nOn the other hand, most manufacturing may involve significant social and environmental costs. The clean-up costs of hazardous waste, for example, may outweigh the benefits of a product that creates it. Hazardous materials may expose workers to health risks. These costs are now well known and there is effort to address them by improving efficiency, reducing waste, using industrial symbiosis, and eliminating harmful chemicals.\nThe negative costs of manufacturing can also be addressed legally. Developed countries regulate manufacturing activity with labor laws and environmental laws. Across the globe, manufacturers can be subject to regulations and pollution taxes to offset the environmental costs of manufacturing activities. Labor unions and craft guilds have played a historic role in the negotiation of worker rights and wages. Environment laws and labor protections that are available in developed nations may not be available in the third world. Tort law and product liability impose additional costs on manufacturing.  These are significant dynamics in the ongoing process, occurring over the last few decades, of manufacture-based industries relocating operations to \"developing-world\" economies where the costs of production are significantly lower than in \"developed-world\" economies.\n\n\n=== Safety ===\nManufacturing has unique health and safety challenges and has been recognized by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) as a priority industry sector in the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) to identify and provide intervention strategies regarding occupational health and safety issues.\n\n\n=== Manufacturing and investment ===\n\nSurveys and analyses of trends and issues in manufacturing and investment around the world focus on such things as:\n\nThe nature and sources of the considerable variations that occur cross-nationally in levels of manufacturing and wider industrial-economic growth;\nCompetitiveness; and\nAttractiveness to foreign direct investors.In addition to general overviews, researchers have examined the features and factors affecting particular key aspects of manufacturing development. They have compared production and investment in a range of Western and non-Western countries and presented case studies of growth and performance in important individual industries and market-economic sectors.On June 26, 2009, Jeff Immelt, the CEO of General Electric, called for the United States to increase its manufacturing base employment to 20% of the workforce, commenting that the U.S. has outsourced too much in some areas and can no longer rely on the financial sector and consumer spending to drive demand. Further, while U.S. manufacturing performs well compared to the rest of the U.S. economy, research shows that it performs poorly compared to manufacturing in other high-wage countries. A total of 3.2 million \u2013 one in six U.S. manufacturing jobs \u2013 have disappeared between 2000 and 2007. In the UK, EEF the manufacturers organisation has led calls for the UK economy to be rebalanced to rely less on financial services and has actively promoted the manufacturing agenda.\n\n\n== List of countries by manufacturing output ==\nThese are the top 50 countries by total value of manufacturing output in US dollars for its noted year according to World Bank.\n\n\n== Manufacturing processes ==\nList of manufacturing processes\nManufacturing Process Management\n\n\n== Control ==\nManagement\nList of management topics\nTotal quality management\nQuality control\nSix Sigma\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of largest manufacturing companies by revenue\nIndustrial robot\nManufacturing engineering\nProcess manufacturing\nManufacturing in the United States\nIndustrial engineering\nAdvanced manufacturing\nMetal fabrication\nMicrofabrication\nOptics fabrication\nSemiconductor device fabrication\nBiomanufacturing\nMesoscale Manufacturing\nCyber manufacturing\nTaylorism/Scientific management\nFordism\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nKalpakjian, Serope; Steven Schmid (August 2005).
