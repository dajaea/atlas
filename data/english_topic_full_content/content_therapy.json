{"topic": "therapy", "english_title": "Therapy", "english": "A therapy or medical treatment (often abbreviated tx, Tx, or Tx) is the attempted remediation of a health problem, usually following a medical diagnosis.  \nAs a rule, each therapy has indications and contraindications.  There are many different types of therapy.  Not all therapies are effective.  Many therapies can produce unwanted adverse effects.\nTreatment and therapy are generally considered synonyms.  However,  in the context of mental health, the term therapy may refer specifically to psychotherapy.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n== Semantic field ==\nThe words care, therapy, treatment, and intervention overlap in a semantic field, and thus they can be synonymous depending on context. Moving rightward through that order, the connotative level of holism decreases and the level of specificity (to concrete instances) increases. Thus, in health care contexts (where its senses are always noncount), the word care tends to imply a broad idea of everything done to protect or improve someone's health (for example, as in the terms preventive care and primary care, which connote ongoing action), although it sometimes implies a narrower idea (for example, in the simplest cases of wound care or postanesthesia care, a few particular steps are sufficient, and the patient's interaction with that provider is soon finished). In contrast, the word intervention tends to be specific and concrete, and thus the word is often countable; for example, one instance of cardiac catheterization is one intervention performed, and coronary care (noncount) can require a series of interventions (count). At the extreme, the piling on of such countable interventions amounts to interventionism, a flawed model of care lacking holistic circumspection\u2014merely treating discrete problems (in billable increments) rather than maintaining health. Therapy and treatment, in the middle of the semantic field, can connote either the holism of care or the discreteness of intervention, with context conveying the intent in each use. Accordingly, they can be used in both noncount and count senses (for example, therapy for chronic kidney disease can involve several dialysis treatments per week).\nThe words aceology and iamatology are obscure and obsolete synonyms referring to the study of therapies.\nThe English word therapy comes via Latin therap\u012ba from Greek: \u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 and literally means \"curing\" or \"healing\".\n\n\n== Types of therapies ==\n\n\n=== By chronology, priority, or intensity ===\n\n\n==== Levels of care ====\nLevels of care classify health care into categories of chronology, priority, or intensity, as follows:\n\nEmergency care handles medical emergencies and is a first point of contact or intake for less serious problems, which can be referred to other levels of care as appropriate.\nIntensive care, also called critical care, is care for extremely ill or injured patients. It thus requires high resource intensity, knowledge, and skill, as well as quick decision making.\nAmbulatory care is care provided on an outpatient basis. Typically patients can walk into and out of the clinic under their own power (hence \"ambulatory\"), usually on the same day.\nHome care is care at home, including care from providers (such as physicians, nurses, and home health aides) making house calls, care from caregivers such as family members, and patient self-care.\nPrimary care is meant to be the main kind of care in general, and ideally a medical home that unifies care across referred providers.\nSecondary care is care provided by medical specialists and other health professionals who generally do not have first contact with patients, for example, cardiologists, urologists and dermatologists. A patient reaches secondary care as a next step from primary care, typically by provider referral although sometimes by patient self-initiative.\nTertiary care is specialized consultative care, usually for inpatients and on referral from a primary or secondary health professional, in a facility that has personnel and facilities for advanced medical investigation and treatment, such as a tertiary referral hospital.\nFollow-up care is additional care during or after convalescence. Aftercare is generally synonymous with follow-up care.\nEnd-of-life care is care near the end of one's life. It often includes the following:\nPalliative care is supportive care, most especially (but not necessarily) near the end of life.\nHospice care is palliative care very near the end of life when cure is very unlikely. Its main goal is comfort, both physical and mental.\n\n\n==== Lines of therapy ====\nTreatment decisions often follow formal or informal algorithmic guidelines. Treatment options can often be ranked or prioritized into lines of therapy: first-line therapy, second-line therapy, third-line therapy, and so on. First-line therapy (sometimes called induction therapy, primary therapy, or front-line therapy) is the first therapy that will be tried. Its priority over other options is usually either: (1) formally recommended on the basis of clinical trial evidence for its best-available combination of efficacy, safety, and tolerability or (2) chosen based on the clinical experience of the physician. If a first-line therapy either fails to resolve the issue or produces intolerable side effects, additional (second-line) therapies may be substituted or added to the treatment regimen, followed by third-line therapies, and so on.\nAn example of a context in which the formalization of treatment algorithms and the ranking of lines of therapy is very extensive is chemotherapy regimens. Because of the great difficulty in successfully treating some forms of cancer, one line after another may be tried. In oncology the count of therapy lines may reach 10 or even 20.\nOften multiple therapies may be tried simultaneously (combination therapy or polytherapy). Thus combination chemotherapy is also called polychemotherapy, whereas chemotherapy with one agent at a time is called single-agent therapy or monotherapy.\nAdjuvant therapy is therapy given in addition to the primary, main, or initial treatment, but simultaneously (as opposed to second-line therapy). Neoadjuvant therapy is therapy that is begun before the main therapy. Thus one can consider surgical excision of a tumor as the first-line therapy for a certain type and stage of cancer even though radiotherapy is used before it; the radiotherapy is neoadjuvant (chronologically first but not primary in the sense of the main event). Premedication is conceptually not far from this, but the words are not interchangeable; cytotoxic drugs to put a tumor \"on the ropes\" before surgery delivers the \"knockout punch\"  are called neoadjuvant chemotherapy, not premedication, whereas things like anesthetics or prophylactic antibiotics before dental surgery are called premedication.\nStep therapy or stepladder therapy is a specific type of prioritization by lines of therapy. It is controversial in American health care because unlike conventional decision-making about what constitutes first-line, second-line, and third-line therapy, which in the U.S. reflects safety and efficacy first and cost only according to the patient's wishes, step therapy attempts to mix cost containment by someone other than the patient (third-party payers) into the algorithm. Therapy freedom and the negotiation between individual and group rights are involved.\n\n\n=== By intent ===\n\n\n=== By therapy composition ===\nTreatments can be classified according to the method
