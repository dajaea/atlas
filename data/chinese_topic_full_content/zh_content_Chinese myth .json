In a certain aspect, the ancient myths will be assumed to be a true part of the history [1], the initial text record on the Chinese myth can be recorded in \"Shanhai Jing\", \"Water Take\", \"Shang Shu\", \"Jiu Song\", \"Historical Record\", \"Book\", \"Chu\", \"Lv Spring and Autumn\", \"Mandarin\", \"Zuo Chuan\", \"Huainanzi\", etc. Ancient Han classics [2].\n\nLike my words of other nations, when China's ancient myth is from the primitive society, human beings try to make reasonable interpretations through reasoning and imagination, but because of the low level of knowledge at the time, it is often covered with a mysterious color.\n\nOn the other hand, the ancient mythology is also the epitome of the ancient society, and most of the characters in myth come from the original human body. For example, the hunting tribe, most of the myths are related to hunting; the tribes of farming, and the myths created are related to agriculture.\n\nThe following is some insights proposed by the scholars on mythology:\n\nAccording to the classification of Chinese mythology, Yuan Wei, now the Chinese myths can be divided into three kinds of \"myth\", \"legend\" and \"fairy\" [6] [7]:\n\nAlthough scholars subdivided the Chinese mythology into three categories, the priests ever joined in mythology, and the people generally mix the three as a talk, for example, explanation:\nIn mythology, Panggu used an ax to smash the heavens, and finally his body also turned into a world; but in the fairy words, the ancient caucasian cactus called \"Yuan Shi Tian Wang\", and he and A fairy called \"Taiyuan Jade\", gave birth to a son called \"Emperor\" [8].\n\nWith regard to the characteristics of Chinese myths, scholars in different fields will put their own focus on their familiar areas and develop different perspectives.

It mainly tells the \"God\", \"Ghost\", \"Xian\", \"Demon\" , \"Fine\", \"strange\", \"Buddha\", \"Magic\" story, a lot of refers to myth, legend and fairy, and the famous \"Feng Shen Romance\", \"Journey\", \"Mirror Flower \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\n\nThe creation of the Han nationality combines Confucian literature, Taoist literature and folk beliefs. However, the narrative between different versions often have conflict, and who is \"the first person\" in Chinese myths, according to the times There were several statements such as God, Day, Female, Pangu and Jade Emperor:\n\nThe characters in the ancient mythum era were condensed into the early tribe of the mother of the mother.\n\nAfter the woman's death, the world is the three emperors and five emperors. The era is about the second year before the Jiyuan, and these leaders were considered a model of Shengming and morality. Since the past, each of the students have real identity for the three emperors. There are differences, the most commonly accepted, from histei and still books:\n\nAccording to legend, in the era of the emperor, the floods of the world were flooded, and the order was ruined for nine years without fault; when the taste was successful, the son who was dead and ordered was to treat water. After reviewing the failure of the failed, the method of reforming the water with Yong Hai, after thirteen years, finally gotting big water. After the success of the water, the emperor Feng Feng is Bo, and the Summer (now Henan) is the country; the emperor is in the 33rd year, the Zen of the emperor will give the emperor, because he is the great achievement of water, then the world Tell him to Daxie.\n\nRegarding the establishment of Xia Dynasty, several different statements were circulated in the book, and the most common acceptance was:\nWhen the emperor was in place, the leader who was originally interested in the east is the successor, but Yao Tao is died in the past, and the son of the emperor and the son of the Tao is beneficial to the heir. Shortly after the death of the emperor, the son of \u542f \u542f \u63a8 \u81ea \u81ea \u4e3a \u738b \u81ea \u81ea \u81ea \u81ea \u81ea \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u81ea \u738b \u738b \u738b \u738b \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u671d \u671d \u671d\n\nXia Dynasty was thought of being a half myth, although the number of 17 emperors of Xia Dynasty in the history and bamboo book year, the archaeologist later found a complete palace site in the second direction (now Henan Yanshi). , Called the Embarm Site.\n\nHowever, there has not been found to prove that the ruins of Xia Chao.\n\nAccording to legend, the last emperor of Xia Dynasty was a huge tyrant, the leader of the business tribe, the leader of the other tribes overturned Xia Xuan. The rule of Shang Dynasty was about 1600 to 1046 before the Western Yuan, and the initial movement was moved; when the Pan Geng successive, Deliu (now Henan Anyang). The last emperor of Shang Dynasty was in place, and the first 1046th, Zhou Wuwang was jointly attacked to the song, and the emperor was self-contained in the Roucai, and the Shang Dynasty was destroyed.\n\nThe archeologist discovered by the Yin Ruins of the Merchant Civilization; however, the Xia Shang Annual Table still has a lot of disputes. The demineralization of Shang Dynasty and the establishment of the Zhou Dynasty constituted the main content of Feng Shen's Romance.
