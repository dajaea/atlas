The Chinese music is two words, Xu Shen, \"said words\" explain \"sound, sound. Born in the heart, there are festivals, the sound.\" Thinking that music and sound is different, the music needs to imagine through people Create.\n\nMusic can be divided into three processes created, played, listened to different cultures and society, have different understandings for music, and their importance, such as in West Africa, everyone is participant, people will not distinguish The identity of composers, players and listeners; but all human culture have music, that is, playing music is a phenomenon in all culturalities.\n\nThe main elements of music have sound, rhythm and tone.

Many of the performances of breakthrough or avant-gardid music were criticized as \"non-music\", such as Beethoven's bigger, and early jazz. However, many musicians in modern times do not agree with the traditional understanding, such as the 20th century American composer John Kaji thinks that any sound and silence are music.\n\nMusic can be descriptled with a score, based on score performance, but there are also many music types such as folk songs or jazz is the performance of the player. The music score can only describe the attributes of the sound or the skills required to play the performance, but cannot record the sound itself. Therefore, before the recording technology appears, enjoy the music must be listened on the spot, or participate in the performance.

The music industry also includes many-oriented: creators of music (composers and filling the wrong words), music players (music group music, singer or command), music recorders (including audio engineers), music activities preparators And the vendors of music resources (records or music).\n\nDifferent combinations of music elements have formed a unique personality of each music, making people understand their structures and expressions when listening to different music, and detect which national, regional, era and type music as much as possible. Each country is not the same as the official definition of music elements, but roughly all elements include:\n\nThe sound of different frequencies is issued at different times, form a melody; the sound of different frequencies is issued at the same time or in a very short period of time, forming a string. The speed of the templer, the regular strong shot and weak shots form the beat, the coherence between the notes is described.\n\nCommonly used pitch forms ranging and tunability; to enrich the fabric of music, you can use the actions and acousticization. The opposition is to make a plurality of different melodies lines, and the sound explore multiple chord continuous matching, both of which are relative.\n\nThere are three types of fabric of music. Monophony is the simplest music fabric, only a single melody line, only two factors of melody and rhythm. If there is a main melody that is dominated by different chords, it is the homophony. If there are more than two melodies independent of each other, it is a Polyphony.\n\nFinally, each musical instrument and each vocal have its own unique tone, different tone instruments combine music unique sound effects, emotions, and symbolic meaning; arrange the combination of these instruments called an attachment.\n\nMusic is a symbol, a sound symbol, and what is thinking about it.

Confucianism, \"Dale and Tiandi, the same section of the sky, the same section of the world\", people can also communicate through music and the heavens and the earth, thus getting wisdom to improve their physical and mental purification. Nowadie scientists study, classical music has a great advantage to the body and mind of the conditioner, especially Mozart's music, benefit to the brain of people, can also reduce the risk of epilepsy patients [1], so good music pair People will regulate the body and reduce the effects of the disease.\n\nThe ancient Greek philosophers Pythagora, interpreted the music in the expression of the \"number\".\n\nThe creation of ancient great musicians and the popularity of folk songs is basically produced by inspiration. Later scholars are studying these more years of music, gradually summarizing the theory, and future musicians will create under these theories.\n\nMusic theory proves which music can be accepted by most people and make people feel pleasing. Modern and combined with physical acoustic research results, the theory is constantly developing.\n\n\n\nThere are two main forms: the sound of vocal music and music music music, whether there are many combination of music or instruments, such as solo, chorus, singing, solo, concerto, symphony, etc. Both can also be mixed, vocal with musical instrument accompaniment, or mixed into vocals in instrumental symphony.\n\nVocal music is a music form of one or more singers, using instrument accompaniment or not, and vocal is the focus of the work.

Music returns to the form of the original car dance dance, which can mobilize people's emotions, so they are warmly welcomed by young people, breaking the regional, nation, and national boundaries, wide popular in the world.\n\nMusic for composer creation can spread several media; the most traditional is one of the live experiences as one of the audience or players. On-site music can also be broadcast through radio, TV or Internet. Some musical styles are pronounced to perform, some focus on generating recording and then used for later reverb synthesis, which is never \"live\".
