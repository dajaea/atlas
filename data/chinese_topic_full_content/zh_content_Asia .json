After the missionary Mission of Jesuit came to China, with the help of the King of the King of the Kunyi, the translator was jointly formed \"Kunyi Wan Guo\" [4]. Since foreigners come in China when foreigners come to China, these translations have strong southern Chinese color.

In its existence, it is more than once, and it is impossible to implement Islamic and modern reforms, so that the boundaries of things civilization have become more vague.\n\nAfter Dongji, after four short-term ban on the ban, 1370, the Ming Taizu established the Ming Dynasty to carry forward this sea-ban policy. Although there is Zheng He's Western Yual, it will maintain a sea-ban policy.

The national civil war, the Korean battle, the Vietnam War is the actor's war under the Mei Su. Asian countries have also begun to rebuild, military in China, successfully nuclear, economically Japan, South Korea and Taiwan's economic recovery under the US aid, and began to be highly developed. After the reform and opening up in 1978, China has become the world's second largest economy.\n\nThe colonies of the United States and the United States have independently, but in the Middle East Israel and the conflict in the Arab countries, the intervention of the British and American Soviet Union makes the situation since the Six-Pedica agreement. South Asia continued to be tight after India and Pakistan, due to the issue of religion and territories, and the two countries were fighting three times, and they had nuclear weapons launching capabilities.\n\nAsian geographies are very vast, in the north, the south extends to the south of the Equator, East, North, South, and three sides are on the verge of Pacific, Arctic Ocean and Indian Ocean, west and Europe, southwest and Africa, East, Brandy Brand North America is facing.\n\nBetween Asia and Europe usually use the Ural, Ural River, the Northwest Sea of \u200b\u200bthe Ural, the High Caucasus Swarfs, the Black Sea, Turkey, Aegean. The Twelve Islands of Greece, Northern Aiqinhai is close to Turkey's Aegean Coast, geographically, should be as asia. The Ural Mountains naturally extends to Vaiqi Island in the Arctic Ocean, and Xinji Island now believes that it belongs to Europe, in fact the Asian European lines in the south bank of Kara.\n\nAsia and African boundary lines are the Suez Canal. The Indian Ocean island Seychelles, Mauritius, and Comoros are all in Africa. Yekotra is close to Africa. Asian and Oceanian boundary lines are Weiber line or Riddi line, so Indonesia's Irian Kia is Oceania. The boundary line of Asia and North America is a white strait and a white sea. Each island is divided into two continents in accordance with the US, Russian jurisdiction [5].\n\nOverall, there are three characteristics of Asian terrain [6]:\n\nThe avenue movement of the Third Ji Ji is far from the influence of Asian terrain. Among them, the Eurasian sector and the Pacific plate collide, and the crust on the tape is pushed into the East Asian arc of the East Palace of East China, and it has made it a region in the world's earthquake volcanoes. The Eurasian continental plate is pushed by the Indian sector, forming a hidden papers of the new pleat mountain. The main mountain range is moving towards, the mountain is towering, the terrain is rugged, and is connected to the south of Asia. And mountain sandy plateau and basins, these places are also the birthplace of the Dahe. Siberia in northern Asia is a crystalline ancient plot, which is rich in metal mine, and the terrain is relatively flat. The hormones of the West Asia are dominated by the plateau, and the middle clamping the beauty of the Corosian in the bottom Gris River and the journal.\n\nAsia's main terrain units are:\n\nAsia's main features are complex and diverse climate types, and the monsoon climate is typical and continental. Sanzhong, temperature, hot three strips, and complex and diverse climates make the world's climate in Asia, all kinds of climate in Asia. East Asia Southeast Half of East Asia is a humid temperate and subtropical quarter wind climate zone, Southeast Asia and South Asia are wet tropical season wind climate, Central Asia, West Asia and East Asian inland for arid areas [6].\n\nThe difference in temperature in Asia is significant. The Malay Islands near the equator, such as summer, the average annual temperature is around 26 \u00b0 C. In the eastern part of Russia, the average temperature of 7 months in Russia, the average temperature is below 0 \u00b0 C, and there is a low temperature record of -71 \u00b0 C Oimikikang in the northeastern town, which is the cold pole of the northern hemisphere. [ 7].\n\nSignificant differences in climate also lead to a huge difference in precipitation in Asia. The annual rainfall in the desert area of \u200b\u200bCentral Asia is less than 100 mm, while in South Asia, the water in the wind reaches 3000 mm, the highest record is even 22,860 mm. The typhoon generated in the Pacific Ocean will also bring abundant rainfall in the eastern part of Asia.\n\nThere are two major characteristics of the Dajiang Dafa River in Asia. There are two main characteristics of the river network [6]: First, the rivers have originated from the central plateau mountains, and the ground is radialous to flow around; the second is that the internal flow area is large, such as the middle The Sier River and the Am River were infined in the salty sea, including the Arm River 2540 kilometers, which is the longest intraudio of Asia. Most of the rivers from the central mountain are eventually injected into the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean or the Arctic Ocean. Among them, there are 7 rivers and above, there are 7 rivers and the longest rivers are the Yangtze River.\n\nThe Richai in the western Asia is the world's largest lake. Lake Baikal is the largest freshwater lake in Asia. It is also the world's deepest, the oldest lake, the bottom of the lake is 1295 meters below the sea level. The Lisris River and the Children's River, the Yellow River, the Indian River Basin are the earliest civilizations. The Ganges is Holy River, Hindu and Buddhism. The Mekong River is an important international river, and the basin country includes the People's Republic of China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.\n\nAsia's natural resources are relatively rich, mineral types, large reserves, mainly oil, coal, iron, tin, tungsten, antimony, copper, lead, zinc, manganese, nickel, molybdenum, magnesium, chromium, gold, silver, rock salt, Sulfur, gem, etc. The reserves such as petroleum, magnesium, iron and tin are first in all continents, including more than 60% of the world's total reserves [7].\n\nThe total forest area of \u200b\u200bAsia accounts for 13% of the total area of \u200b\u200bthe world, part of Russia, the northeastern China, North Korea Democratic People's Republic of China, is a wide range of coniferous forests in the world, and has a lot of precious materials. . South Slope of China, Southwest, Japan Mountain, is particularly abundant, except for ordinary broad-leaved tree species, and palm, plaster, fir, flutter, etc. The tropical forests in Southeast Asia are an important position in the world forest, which is known for a constant, rich plant community. Its main tree species is the dragon brain, and there is a tree fern, ginkgo, and \u6d3b \u94c1, etc. [7].\n\nAsia's hydraulic resources are also relatively abundant. The development of hydraulic resources that can be developed can reach 26,000 billion degrees, accounting for 27% of the world's ability to develop hydraulic resources [7].\n\nAsia is the world's most populous, most dense continent, with a total population of 3672 million in 2000, accounting for 60% of the world's total population, with an average of 80 per square kilometers. There are more than 1,000 nationalities in Asia, accounting for about half of the total number of world nationalities [6]. The major nations are Mongolians (yellow people) and Caucasus (Caucasian), and there are a wide variety of people, including most of the language. At present, the population growth rate of East Asia has dropped to 1%, but the average growth rate of population growth rate in Southeast Asia, South Asia and West Asia is 1%.\n\nAsia's main nations include:\n\nIn ancient times, Asia has always been the center of the world economy. At that time, the world's major powers, such as China, India, Arab, and Persia (now Iran) were located in Asia. Asian farming industry can maintain most of the world's population. The main food producing area of \u200b\u200bthe EU's largest Empire Empire is also located in Asia.\n\nAfter the 18th Century Industrial Revolution, European capitalism raised, imperialism policies as other places as colonial expansion and plunder, most of Asia, America, Africa and Australia became European colonial or semi-colonial land. In addition to Australia and North America because local aborigines are almost completely destroyed, becoming a European world. Other Asia, Latin America and Africa have gradually independent in the Second World War, and the economy is also in a very backward situation. But in the second half of the 20th century, Asia is the most rising place in these original colonies. Japan first became among the world, for the first developed country in Asia, the Asian four small dragons (Republic of Korea, the Republic of China, China, Hong Kong and Singapore) have become the development of national or region at the end of the 20th century, and the economic rise of the People's Republic of China has Become Asia's largest economies, the world's second largest economies, second only to the United States. The rapid development of the Indian economy has made it a world's eye-catching place. Due to the large area of \u200b\u200bAsia, the difference in economic development in each region is large.\n\nAsian resources are absentized in Asia, including Bay Country Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Kuwait, Yemen and Iran, and in Indonesia, China, China, and Russia are also mainly producing oil. Asian part of mainland China and Russia is the highest in the world. Southeast Asia is the main supply of world hardwood and is also a region where tourism resources are rich. In addition to South Africa, the world's diamond production area is only an important part of the Asian part of India and Russia. Asia also includes almost all mineral resources with economic value.\n\nDue to the broad field of Asian, many nations, the diversity of culture is very strong, the difference is very large, and there is almost no unified \"Asian culture\". The three major religions of the world are born in Asia. After the ancient Greek decline, before the 18th century industrial revolution, due to the world's economic focus in Asia, most of the technical achievements of most human technology were produced in Asia. As early as 3,000 BC, Asian people have invented the burning pottery and smelting ore, Asia's Sume people first invented the text and system irrigation project, Central Asian nomad invented saddle, bow and arrow and wheels, Chinese Invented porcelain, gunpowder, compass, papermaking and carving printing, and plant rice. Indians and the Arab people invented the decisor computing technology. Asia's various local pharmaceutical technology even very effective today, but also in many areas.\n\nMany of the west and oriental instruments have the same origin, so they are very similar, such as violins and two Hu, guitar and \u7435\u7436, double arch tubes and \u5522\u5450, almost the same things. In fact, most of these instruments are originated in the Middle East.\n\nAsian national tourism has been very developed in recent years, mainly in the development areas and Metropolitan districts, including: China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Maldives, Thailand, India, Japan, Vietnam, South Korea, Saudi Arabia (including Mecca, UAE, Emirates, Qatar, Indonesia, Nepal, Bhutan, Iran, Pakistan, Turkey, etc.\n\nThe Asian Games is the largest, high-level comprehensive sports meeting in Asia, representing sports levels throughout Asia. It is the regional large-scale integrated sports meeting recognized by the International Olympic Committee, hosted by the Asian Olympic Council (Olympic Council), every four years. Its predecessor is the Far East Games and the West Asian Games. The first Asian Games were originally held in New Delhi in India in February 1949. Due to the preparations for the host country, it was held in 1951, and the 17th was held.\n\nAsia is divided into the following parts in geographical habits:\n\nEast Asia, it refers to the collectiveness of countries and regions in eastern Asia, with a double significance of geographic and cultural levels. Geography, it is the country and region of the Pacific Ocean in the north latitude of 20 degrees north to north to north to north to north. East Asia can be divided into three parts: Greater China, Northeast Asia and inland areas.\n\nSoutheast Asia includes Central South Peninsula and island in South China Sea and Pacific (collectively referred to as Malay Islands).\n\nSouth Asia includes the North of India to Xindukus Hill, as well as countries and regions in the north bank of the Indian Ocean.\n\nWest Asia is located in the west of Asia. It is a hub of contact Ya, Europe, non-Three continents and communication at the Atlantic, Indian Ocean, including Nankau Caucasus, Xiao Yawaia Peninsula (Anatolia), Iranian Plateau, Li Fante, Arabic Peninsula, Meso Damia plains and other areas. Asian part of West Asia and the Middle East overlap, but West Asia also includes Caucasus three countries.\n\nCentral Asia refers to the inland region of Asian Europe, usually in the five post-Soviet countries that are Tularan Plains to the Pamir Plateau.\n\nNorth Asia with Siberian concept overlaps, was jurisdiction in Russia.\n\nThe continents in the world have a large number of countries, second only to Africa. All territories are located in Asia, the largest and smallest countries are the People's Republic of China and the Islanda Maldives; the smallest countries in Asia are Lebanon.\n\nAsian countries are very complicated and are world hotspots.\n\nAt present, most of the international concern hotspots are also in Asia:\n\nRegional cooperation in Asia is in the ascendant, now the most promising places in regional cooperation are 10 Member States in Southeast Asia, Southeast Asian countries: Wen Rui, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. The total area is about 4.5 million square kilometers, with a population of about 512 million. There is also an observer country: Papua New Guinea. ASEAN countries have started the three East Asian countries of the People's Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, and established China-ASEAN Free Trade Area in 2010 and the People's Republic of China. The current People's Republic of China has started to start fruit and vegetables in Thailand. mechanism. The regional comprehensive economic partnership agreements jointly participated by the People's Republic of China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and the ASEAN have also participated in the regional comprehensive economic partnership agreement have also signed in 2020.\n\nSouth Asian countries are also tightening the organization, Pakistan and India's relationship between the organization, Pakistan and India.
