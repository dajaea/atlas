More stringent, literary writing is an artistic form, or any single work that is considered to have art or intellectual value, which is usually deployed in a way different from normal use.\n\nIts latin root Literatura / Litteratura (itself originated from Littera: Letter or Handwriting) is used to refer to all written records, although contemporary definitions extend the terminology to text (oral literature) including oral or singing. Literature can be classified according to the fictional work or non-fictitious works, or it can be classified according to the rhyme or the prose; can be further distinguished according to the main forms of long novels, the novels, short novels; works often according to historical periods or to certain aesthetics Features or expectations (art types) are classified.\n\nReflections with language text to reflect the art, including rhyme, prose, scripts, novels, etc., is an important manifestation of culture, with different genres in the inner emotions and reproduction of life and a certain period of life.\n\nThis concept changed its significance over time: Now it can expand the verbal art form of non-book, can cooperate with the language or text itself, so it is difficult to agree on its origin.\n\nThe development of printing technologies makes the distribution and spread of written works, and ultimately leads to online literature.\n\nLiterature is not necessarily objective, a successful writer can show his own subjective views, express their emotions and feelings, but by trying to build a \"objective standard\", When you can help writers to learn about \"readers\" to reflect in the heart of the inner emotional and artistic performance.\n\nSometimes it can also borrow the concept of the idea of \u200b\u200bthe concept, so that the society has different faces to save the situation, such as the rise of women's literature.\n\nThe history of literature is closely related to the development of civilization. If literature is defined as a writing record, the earliest ancient literary work is generally considered to be ancient Egyptian literature [1] and Sumei literature (English: SUMERIAN LITERATURE) [2]. The main instruments in the ancient Egyptian literature (praise poems, prayers and stories) are almost all in the way of poetry [3], but although it can be clearly seen with poetic devices, but the rhythm of poetry is unknown [ 4]. The earliest known literary work is 2700 BC's \"Gilgamesh Shi Shi\" created by Su Men, which describes heroism, friendship, losses and chasing eternal life.\n\nDifferent distinctive literature have different characteristics.

These plots are not only entertaining, including related information about economic, psychological, scientific, religion, politics, culture and socialism. Studying and analyzing literature is also an important part when studying history. Studying past literature can see different historical periods, their evolution of their society and social norms, even can help understand today's literature, because of the information of ancient Greek mythology, religious classics and related literature. It is more than just seeing this topic from the topic of literature. With the evolution of history (eg, from the book of the economic history or the book of science and evolution), you can see similar content in the science fiction. The authors often add some historical content in their works, such as the Lord Byron in \"Childe Harold's Pilgrimage: Canto I\" to mention Spanish and French by the protagonist Childe Harold, which also mentioned some of the author's ideas [5]. By literary people can continue to discover new information about history, this can be seen from various disciplines in various disciplines. [6]. When people record information in writing, it is easier to pass through this generation to the next generation, and the information left will be more and more. From these information, people can study literature, improve ideas, and expand knowledge, and began research on medical or trade. With the increase and expansion of modern people's learning content, literature will have some differences, and become the foundation of people's research.\n\nMany ancient civilizations have their literature about philosophy or related perspectives, like ancient China, ancient India, Persian and Greek Roman's classical work. Many ancient works, even if there is a narrative form, there is still a moral or teachings, like Sanskrits, \"five volumes\" or Ovid's \"modified\", and later the audience of the drama and satirus There is therefore a literary creation of similar nature begins.

But pure literature has appeared in the week, such as the \"Book of Songs\". Ancient Chinese literature focuses on philosophy, history history, military, agriculture and rhyme. China invented the papermaking and carving printing, and the world's first printing civilization (English: Print Culture) [7]. Many of China's philosophical thinking is the hundreds of sons in the Spring and Autumn Period, and the most important thing has Confucianism, Taoist, ink family and French, and military school books (such as Sun Tzi) began to appear during the Spring and Autumn Warring States. Chinese historical literature has continued from Shang Shu, Spring and Autumn, War National Policy, and History, etc., and has a very detailed information record.\n\nChina's literary achievement is the biggest poetry, from \"Liu\" to Tang Dynasty, poetry has been a huge impact on Chinese literature.
