This makes people have a few different \"Europe\" concepts.\n\nYou can click on the European map: show the boundary line formed with the historical cause of the Asian mainland. (See Asia and Europe's boundary line for more information).\n\nLegend: Blue = InterContinental Country; Green = Sometimes it is considered to be Europe, but outside the European border line.\n\n\n\n\nThe origin of the European name may be a woman from the Myth of Greece, she is attracted by Zeus that has become Bull.

Among them, the Ice Legal Lakes left to the country of Finland as the country of thousands of lakes.\n\nEuropean latitude is north of 35 degrees north latitude, most of which belong to temperate climate, extending north to the Arctic Circle, so the tapered climate in Northern Worth and southern parties. There is no hot summer temperature in Europe that has a hot summer temperature above 30 degrees Celsius, and there is no cool cold area with the most cold moon, and the disaster weather is also less than other continents.\n\nUnder the adjustment of Western Breeze, the climate in Western Europe and the western Europe and the Nordic waters is the greatest global deviation. Therefore, there is no cold flow in the coast of North Atlantic, so this winter is not cold, and the summer is not hot, it is pleasant, and it belongs to the temperate Marine climate.\n\nEastern Europe belongs to temperate continental wet climate, and the annual temperature is relatively large, but it is still smaller in East Asia in the same latitude. Southern is close to the Mediterranean, winter rain, because the summer side tropical high-pressure knock, winter western wind blows. And the Arctic Coastal area is a tundra climate.\n\nAccording to these two and three hundred years of archaeological discovement, it has confirmed that European (including UK, etc.) has some human activities in the old stone age.\n\nIn the first 4000 centuries of BC, the Celtics of Western Europe have a huge stone culture, and now there is a European boulder architecture.

With the advancement of technology, the continuous exploration of the outside world, the proposal of the evolution of the outside world, Europe became the cradle of imperialism, plundering resources in the world.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the extreme expansion of imperialism has finally leading to Europe to become a war policy source, and two world wars have caused great trauma and losing world hegemony. European countries have lost their colonial rule.\n\nDuring the First World War, there were the world's first socialist country - Soviet Union.

The total area of \u200b\u200bthe total cultivated land is about 290 million hectares, and the proportion of agricultural population is 15%. However, due to dense population, high consumption, most national food cannot be self-sufficient. European industrial output is the highest in all continents. The transportation industry is extremely developed. There are 350,000 meters of railways in the provinces; the total length of the road is 4.2 million; the total tonnage of the sea accounts for 45% of the world, which has a strong export economy. In addition, European aviation industry and tourism are also very developed.\n\nThe European population has about 728 million (2005 data), accounting for about 11% of the world's total population.

Therefore, the relationship between Southeast Asian countries and European countries is very deep. Due to this profound relationship, in today's international relations, Europe has a certain degree of influence on Southeast Asia; in Southeast Asia, the Philippines, the Catholic Church The bishop assignment of the assignment is also political and social influence. Japan in Northeast Asia has made a shaft country in Germany and Yuri in the Second World War. Now Japan, South Korea and European countries are mainly based on economic relations, and political alliance has gradually decreased.\n\nAlthough Europe and the United States have a strong historical origin and contact, it is roughly in the middle of the 20th century. After the Second World War, the United States and Europe have a close relationship. Prior to this, due to the Americas in the 17th century, it was places where European countries spread out of the people and prisoners.

Thereafter, due to the policy of implementing political mutual intervention in the United States and Europe, both of them have their own development in the 18th to the 19th century. The two world wars in the 20th century, making European vitality, but the US economy has highly increased, and Western Europe requires US economic assistance, nature is close to the United States. Plus Eastern European countries joined the socialist camp, and thus landed with the United States. During the Cold War, the threat of socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union strengthens intimacy of other European countries and the United States in Eastern Europe. However, after the end of the Cold War, the threat disappears, Europe (mainly EU member states) has changed in the relationship between the United States, and Europe needs to have their own voice, so some European countries are in the September 1 event, Iraq issue, Iraqi issue The aspects have different opinions from the United States, even with large differences, but its root deep allies will remain unchanged.

Spain, Poland, etc., for the Second War of Meiyi's second war, making the United States praise these countries for new Europe, but with the horror of terrorists to attack Spain, Spain has exited her with the United States, from Iraq withdrawing the army .\n\nGeographically, Europe and the Middle East are neighbors. In history, the relationship between Europe and the Middle East has always been nervous, basically because the two are different from the religious concept: most of Europe is the main belief in Christianity, and the Middle East Arab countries Taking Islam as a state. Middle Eastern regions have become the colony of the United Kingdom and France after the First World War of the 20th century.\n\nThe relationship between Turkey in Turkey in Europe and Xiao Asia is very subtle, it is located at the junction of Asia, and it has been destroyed by the Undertang Empire. Now it is eager to join the EU.\n\nThe relationship between Europe and North Africa is similar to her relationship with the Middle East, because North Africa is in the Mediterranean Sea, and North Africa is also a harmonious country area. In history, only the medieval period, the Arab Empire has ruled the south of Spain, Portugal and France. Since European colonialism, Africa has become the colonies in Europe, France's colonial, West African colonies established in Central Africa, West Africa and North Africa, is the largest colonial in the African continent.
