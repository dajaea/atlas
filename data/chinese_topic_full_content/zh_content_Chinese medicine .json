{"chinese_title": "Chinese medicine ", "chinese": "Chinese medicine, also known as Hanji, is a traditional medicine originated from Han Han and has now had a history of thousands of years [1]. Compared with modern Western medicine, it is often classified into traditional medicine. Therefore, today's development goals of traditional Chinese medicine are mostly pursuing their scientific and modernization.\n\nAccording to the nouns approved by the National Science and Technology Nouns Trial Committee, Traditional Chinese Medicine is \"the main body of traditional Chinese medicine is the main body, study the conversion of health and disease in human life activities and its prevention, diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation and health care. Comprehensive science [2]. In 2017, the first Chinese medicine law in mainland China was implemented [3].\n\nIn modern, general Chinese medicine refers to all national medicine and religious medicine within the scope of the Chinese nation. Such as Chinese medicine, Tibetan doctor, Mongolian doctor, Miao doctor, Dai doctor, medical doctor, Kazakh, Buddha doctor, etc .; narrow Chinese medicine, refers to Chinese medicine.\n\nThe word \"Chinese Medicine\", one is from Japan, one is from the name of the Qing Dynasty. [4] Also known as the Chinese medicine or Hanfang medicine, is a traditional medical thought and treatment technology developed in China because it is a traditional medical tradition that has developed in the Han nationality, so it is a Chinese medicine. With the development of Chinese culture, it is spread to South Korea, Vietnam, Japan, etc., combined with local medicine, forming a variety of different genres.\nThe nature of the \"Han Medical\" is Japan, in the Yangtze River Period, they use this noun to distinguish between \"Han Medical\", and Western Medicine - \"Lan Medicine\" (Netherlands). This noun is also used in the Qing Dynasty to call China's traditional medicine.\nBefore 1949, the term \"Chinese medicine was more common. In the Republic of China, also used national medicine. In China, \"Chinese Medicine\" (meaning \"China\" medicine) is more common than \"Han Medical\". However, this more neutral noun is still used in Japan and South Korea.\nJapan's Hanfang Medicine, South Korea's Korean Medicine, North Korea's Korean Medical Medicine, Vietnam's East Medicine is developed based on traditional Chinese medicine.\n\nChinese medicine uses yin and yang five elements as theoretical foundation, regards human body as a unity of gas, shape, god, through the method of hope, smell, ask, cut, four consultation, to explore cause, pathological, disease, analysis The machine and the change in the human body, the changes of meridian joints, gas-bloodation fluids, judge the evil and gain, and then derive the disease name, summarize the issuance, with the principle of syndrome differentiation, to develop \"sweat, spit, under, and, warm, clear, make , Eliminate the use of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture, hair, massage, massage, cupping, Qigong, diet, etc., so that the human body reaches yin yang and rehabilits. The active perspective of Chinese medicine treatment is that it can help restore the humans' yin and yang balance, and the negative surface is to use the drug to slow the deterioration of the disease, and can also take into account the quality of life and life [5]. In addition, the ultimate goal of Chinese medicine is not only to treat diseases, and further is to help human beings are close to the four models present in the \"Yellow Emperor\", namely, the realm of people, people, saints, and sages [6].\n\nIn recent years, the governments in various localities have begun to supervise the professional Chinese medicine industry to protect public health.\n\nThe Government of the People's Republic of China established the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine in 1988, which is a deputy national bureau affiliated to the Ministry of Health (the 2013 Health Department has revocated after the Safety Planning Commission).\n\nIn order to inherit and promote the development of traditional Chinese medicine, guarantee and promote the development of traditional Chinese medicine, protect the people's health, pass the \"People's Republican Chinese Medicine Law\" by the Twenty-five National People's Congress Standing Committee, on July 1, 2017 Implementation.\n\nChinese medicine does not legally practice medical practice during the Hong Kong-British period, but can register and conduct activities in the name of \"Herbalist\". Chinese medicine practitioners can also use the \"Chinese Medicine\", \"Chinese Medicine\", \"Traditional Chinese Medicine\", \"National Medicine\", \"Tang Medical\", etc., can not use \"Doctor\", \"Physician\", Medical Center, \"Medical Center\", etc. It belongs to the name of the medical scope, so the Chinese medicine practitioners have no right to sign a death certificate, and they cannot open any Western medicine on the prescription. Otherwise, it is considered to be illegal [7].\n\nThe Hong Kong Government established the Hong Kong Traditional Chinese Medicine Management Committee in 1999 to use the professional level of traditional Chinese medicine trading and Chinese medicine practitioners in 1999 to protect public health and consumer rights. According to the \"Traditional Chinese Medicine Regulations\", all Chinese medicine practitioners practicing in Hong Kong must register to the Chinese Medicine Management Committee. Before the registration system of the Chinese medicine teacher, in addition to providing the national medical treatment and the entrance to the practitioner who was named \"Chinese medicine\", there was later incorporated into the Chinese medicine registration system, when the common name \"Down Master\", \"fall Campaign. There is no unified saying that there is no unified statement, and there is a saying that is related to the wind of the martial arts in Hong Kong in the last century. [8] Later, due to the shortness of this industry, the \"Traditional Chinese Medicine Regulations\" and the implementation of the Chinese medicine registration system, regulatory activities or matters, including Chinese medicine, etc., and the Master has already It is incorporated into Chinese medicine, and people who have become a registered Chinese medicine (bone injury) must be approved and subjected to formal training, so old-fashioned museums have a gradual micro trend.\nRegistration procedures include: Completing the recognized five-year college Chinese medicine courses, gaining 30 weeks of clinical internship experience, through professional practitioners. [9] In addition, the Traditional Chinese Medicine Management Committee requested registration Chinese medicine practitioners, and the continued procedures were completed for 60 persistent cultivations every three years, and the continued training is completed to ensure the professional level of registered Chinese medicine practitioners. [10]\n\nThe colonial government in the Macaoogl is basically non-intervention in Chinese society, so many spontaneous spontaneous spontaneous organizers and Chinese medicine houses in Macau. In 1994, the Australian Government promulgated the \"Decree of No. 53/94 / M\", which officially regulated Chinese herbal medicine transactions. Macao sovereignty has been transferred to the SAR Government to supervise the Chinese medicine market [11]. In 2000, Macau University of Science and Technology and Nanjing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine colleges have established the Macao Academy of Chinese Medicine, which opened the course of learning of traditional Chinese medicine. [12].\n\nThere are currently more than 30,000 license acupuncturists (some states are called acupuncture physicians, and more than 5,000 Western physicians have access to acupuncture licenses. The United States has a strict acupuncture license issue system, but due to the implementation of the federal system, all states have local laws, and supervise the issuance of acupuncturer. Therefore, the requirements for the license issuance of each state are different, but the applicant is generally required to learn acupuncture or Chinese medicine schools approved by the US Higher Education Department. It is not equal to the 1700 to 4000, and the general requirements have 950 hours of clinical internship experience can be allowed to participate in the acupuncture license test. In addition, each state requires the holder of acupuncture licenses, and has renewed the acupuncture per year or every two years, otherwise its acupuncture license will be removed. The procedure of the acupuncture surplus, in addition to the update information, the acupuncture division also requested that acupuncturists provide evidence of continuous progress, and generally do dozens hours a year of professional continuous training courses can be renewed.\nThere is no valid license, but also claims to be professional acupuncturist, or providing Chinese medicine treatment is a criminal offense. The violations will face imprisonment and fines.\n\nUntil 2012, there were six stations in the United States without law supervision of traditional Chinese medicine, generally known as \"Oriental Medicine\" or \"Acupuncture\", including Alabama, Kansas, North Dakota, South Dakota State, Oklahoma, Wyoming. [13] In the state of law supervision of Chinese medicine, California is the first state legislative supervision \"acupuncture\" in the United States. In 1976, California has begun to issue professional licenses to acupuncturers [14].\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that \"Acupuncture\" or \"Acupuncturists\" or \"Acupuncturists\" or \"Acupuncturists\" or \"Acupuncturists\" is equivalent to \"Chinese Medicine\" and \"Chinese Medicine\". As an example of California, the first State Legislation Acupuncture, according to the \"Business and Professional Code\", \"Business and Professional Code\", \"Acupuncture\" refers to the improvement, maintaining and restoring health, and providing inhalation, Electricity, Chinese massage, acupoint massage, moxibustion, cupping, respiratory skills, exercise therapy, heat therapy, cold therapy, magnetic therapy, nutritional therapy, diet, herbal therapy, plant therapy, animal therapy, mineral therapy, Professionals such as dietary supplement therapy [15]. Therefore, the \"acupuncturist\" in the United States is \"Chinese Medicine\".\n\nDiet - Apparel - Architecture - Cultural Relics - Festival - Folk - Education\nScience - Five-Trim (Medical - Surgery) - Wushu\n\nWhether Chinese medicine is currently unable to determine the earliest traditional medicine. China's Chinese medicine claims to be active from the three emperors, and the vitalville invented acupuncture and tried herbs. Shennong Yan Emperor tasted hundreds of grass and detoxified it with tea. TCM researchers claimed that in more than 3,000 BC, China's Xuanyuan Huangdi wrote the first medical book of humanity - \"Yellow Emperor\" (However, Oracle of Oracle 1600 ~ 100) is considered China The earliest text found in the times), \"Medical books can be used in 3,000 years ago,\" in the current medical book \"is currently inconsistent with the facts compared to the non-free Chinese medicine. Mesopoamia Medicine in 3,000 BC has used wedge text to record the center of liver and dirty is the center of blood, and the disease is divided into fever, stroke, mental symptoms, eye diseases, ear disease, jaundice, etc. In China, after the \"Yellow Emperor Wishes\", the world has continuously added to the deletion, gradually forming the \"Yellow Emperor\" and \"Yellow Emperor\" and \"Yellow Emperor\", and the pure medical medicine will be separated from wish to the department. Later Chinese medicine. The \"Yellow Emperor's Internal Classics\" in the world proposed the prevention and health care in the disease and health care in the world. [Source Request]\nChina has established the world's first hospital and medical system in Zhou Dynasty (771 BC) China, and the medical institution of Zhou Dynasty has a physician, from the medical institution. (Tube Record), a few people. Here are four kinds of medical (tube diet), medical (internal medicine), ulcer (surgical), veterinarian; however, such medical distribution system is behind Mesopoamia Medicine for hundreds of years [16] . The medical administration of the doctor, and the doctor is appointed at the end of the year; \"Zhou Li Tianshi\" records \"year-end, then the killing of the medical, to make food\", that is, doctors must increase and decrease through the year-end assessment . The patients at the time have been treated, and the medical record is established. \"If the dead end, the book is, it is in the physician,\" stipulates that the death caused by the deceased medical record, and then sent to the physician to archive to summarize medical experience and improve medical technology. This is also known earliest medical record system.\n\nAt the Spring and Autumn Warring States (770 BC - the first 221 years), the famous medical doctor is a medical doctor, and the Qin State has a long mulberry and his apprentice. Bianque invented the unique syndrome differentiation of Chinese medicine, summed up as \"four diagnosis\" methods, namely \"hope, smell, ask, cut\". Bianque looks at the disease, the principle of \"six mysteria\": one is the power of relying on the power, the arrogance of the arrogance; the second is to be greedy money, no life; the third is overeating, the eating is not true; four is the depth of illness Does not rule; five is that the body is weak and can't take medicine; Sixth is to believe that witchcraft does not believe in medical treatment. After the world, he called him to bite his doctor. The main medical books in the Spring and Autumn Warring States have a \"Yellow Emperor's Internal\", \"Yellow Emperor\", \"Bian Dynasty\", \"Bai's Internal Classics\", \"Bai's Foreign\" and \"Next\" This seven, synthesized \"seven\".\n\nThe world's earliest forensic doctor in the world in the Qin Dynasty (221 BC)-\"History\". Qin Limo stipulates that the case of unknown causes must be carried out in principle, and the judiciary will be punished if the judiciary is not inspected. The \"diagnosis\" of the Qin Dynasty has a more detailed description of the method and procedures of forensic identification. In human mandarin cases, the main contents of the identification test include the position of the body, the part, the number, direction and the size of the wound. After the completion of the history of the history, a written report must be submitted, called \"\u7230\u4e66\", is the earliest foreurized forensic identification and on-site survey report in the world. The Qin Dynasty was also the first in the world to establish an infectious disease hospital - \"\u75a0 \u75a0 \u6240\", has developed an isolation system for the treatment of infectious diseases. According to 1975, Yunmeng sleep unearthed Qin Ji: At that time, the doctor found that there was a collapse of the nose, no sweat, hoarse, and stimulating the nasal cavity without sneezing, and stimulating the symptoms of the nasal cavity without sneezing. The treatment is separated from the mobility. This shows that the treatment measures for infectious diseases in ancient China have been effective.\n\nDuring the Western Han Dynasty (202 BC - 8 years AD), the yin and yang of Chinese medicine has been very complete, and the famous doctors have Taicang Gongyi and the public. The famous medical family Zhang Zhongjing and Hua Wei appeared in the Eastern Han. Zhang Zhongjing improved the dialectical theory of Chinese medicine. He is also the first clinical medicine master in the world, and is honored to be a doctor. He has a medical book such as \"Winning Writing\", \"Medick Women\", \"Dangu Fang\", \"Dentory\", \"Phase\", and finally circulating the medical books, the medical books, were compiled as \"typhisticalism\" and \"\u91d1\u532e \u8981\". Zhang Zhongjing adopts the basic principles of syndrome differentiation. In the \"Treatise on Talete\", Zhang Zhongzhi is \"eight-way syndrome differentiation\" and \"six-class\". After the treatment of these two methods, the \"eight law\" (sweat, spit, under, and , Temperature, clear, supplement, and eliminate the treatment of diseases. \"Ozang Disease Difference\" is the specific principle of implementing the identification of differentiation, the so-called \"eight\" (yin, yang, table, inherent, cold, hot, virtual, real) is the use of \"four diagnosis\" (expect, smell, ask, cut, cut ) Analysis and examination of the part of the disease, the nature summarizes, \"Six Six\" is a specific application of the whole visceral and meridian. At the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty, Hua Wei took the world with proficiency surgery and anesthesia, Hua Wei is the first person in the world. The number of surgical surgery in the world. He invented the amorrage is the world's best anesthetic drug, but also founded The world's earliest fitness gymnastics \"five birds\". Unfortunately, the \"Green Book\" of the medical book of Hua Wei was finally paid. In the Han Dynasty, a large number of medicines and theories were introduced to Tibet (\"Tibet Wang Dynasty\" records). In the Han Dynasty, there were also special gynecological hospitals, and the \"Male\" in the Western Han Dynasty was the world's best in the world.\n\nDuring the Nort-North Dynasties (420-1589), the world's earliest two pediatric monographs, namely the \"children's use of drugs\" and Xu Shuyu's \"Medicine Hundred Diseases\". In the Southern Dynasties, Song Yuanjia was twenty years (AD 443), the Tai Medical Monitor made Qin Chengzu created the world's first medical school. In the 6th century AD, Sui Dynasty improved the medical education institution and was named \"Tai Medical Services\". The department is divided into medical, the drug is two, the doctor's order is the highest official position, the assistant, the subject, the doctor, Pharmacist, Doctor, Dr. Taoist, Massage, Wishing Dr. Bai, a lot of teachers and students in schools, more than 580 people.\n\nIn the Northern Song Dynasty, with the high development of trade between China and the Arab, Arabian incense has also begun to enter China. Arabian milky in China is actually taken by 10,000 pounds, and Islamics also have a significant impact on China. Traditional Chinese medicine is self-reliant During the Northern Song During the Northern Song Dynasty, the Tai Hospital was also divided into 13 countries such as ancient Greece and Arabic medicine. This may be a horizontal impact of Arabic-Islamic medicine. Traditional Chinese medicine is dominated by soup, but the \"Taiping Sheng Hui Fang\" in the Northern Song Dynasty, \"Shengji Purchase\" has increased a lot of prescriptions of pills, scatters, paste, and, such as \"milk sun\", \"Aweyuan\". The reason is, it is to use a lot of absorbers from the import of Arab-Islamic countries, and the detachment contains volatile substances. If the frying is used, its effective ingredient will lose, so it can only be made into a pill, scattered, paste . It can be seen that the appearance of this type of prescription is the result of the impact of Arabic-Islamic pharmacology to traditional Chinese medicine [17].\n\nIn the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907), Sun Sizhen summed up the theory of the predecessors and summed up experience, collecting more than 5,000 drugs, published \"Daily Medical Sincere\", \"Qianjin Forum\" and \"Qianjin Wing Party\" three The medical book, the next generation, said that he is a king. After the Tang Dynasty, China's medical theory and books were rumored to Turkic, Gao Ji, Japan, Central Asia, West Asia.\n\nAt the end of the Tang Dynasty, the pediatrics were \"cranioted\", and the first famous pediatric expert money in the history of the world's medical history (AD 1032-113) was inspired by this book, and the famous pediatric master is written. \" Direct drug certificate, the future generations, called Qian Yi as \"Sheng Shu\", \"The Nasal Ancestor of the Young\". In the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127), the Song government set up the Hanlin Medical College, the Thai Medical Bureau, and the medical science has been very complete, and the Chinese acupuncture acupoints are unified, publish \"map\". Song Ci in the Southern Song Dynasty published the world's earliest forensic book \"washing collection\".\n\nDuring the Yuan Dynasty, the Yuan government attached great importance to Islamine, adopting Chinese medicine and back to medical policies. In Taiyuan, there is a \"Guanghui\" specializing in the use of Islamic medicine. Its duty is \"Application for returning to drugs and agents, with the treatment of the guards and shanas in Beijing.\" It also has most of them. Return to the pharmacology and go back to the pharmacology, pay back (Muslim) medicine. In the Yuan Dynasty, there are a lot of Arabi-Islamic physicians to China, which is welcomed by the Dynasty, known as \"Back to the Doctor\". They have a research on anatomy and proficient in various surgery. In the ended behalf of the famous literary, the \"Nanyun Tilm\" volume of Tao Zongyi's \"Nanyuan Dairy\", in the Western Western Medicine, there is a child who has returned to the doctor to take a headache to remove the tumor from the brain. Legendary story in Malaysia. These medical practitioners also bring a lot of Islamic medical books [17].\n\nIn the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), the famous medical master Li Shizhen's medical masterpiece \"The Materia Medica\" is not only a pharmaceutical monograph, but also the knowledge of botany, zoology, mineralogics, chemistry. \"Materia Medica\" was quickly passed on as asia, North Korea, and Vietnam, which were translated into a variety of European languages \u200b\u200bin the 17th and 18th centuries. On the other hand, Li Shizhen is the first in the world to put forward the brain's mental feeling, and find gallstocks, and use ice to reduce high-fever patients to cool down and inventive medical practitioners. In addition, there is Wang Shuhe's \"pulse\", Huang Yi's \"acupuncture\", Tao Hongjing's \"Pharaoa intensive\", Ge Hong's \"Emergency\", Nest Yuan's \"Source Waiting\", Su Jing \"New Repair Materia Medica\", Wang Hao's \"Outer Secret\", Yuan Dan Gub's \"Four Medical Draft\", \"Taiping Sheng Hui Fang\", Wang Weiyi's \"Copper Host Acupuncture Turan\" and other large number of medical clauses come out. Self-cultivation has reached its peak, and there are many medical geography. At the same time, the so-called Eastern Medicine in the Korean research in North Korea has also been greatly developed. For example, Xu Wei wrote \"Dongxian Bao Jian\".\n\nDuring the Qing Dynasty, the pharmaceutical progress was shown in many ways, which was basically the continuation of the Ming Dynasty Medicine. If the study of classics, this histology, prescription, diagnosis and treatment, medical case finish, etc., are more mature than the Ming Dynasty. The disputes between each school have also gradually ease. Most doctors can pick up all their families in clinical. But there is no lack of insightful \"internal\", \"difficult\", \"typhisthetism\", and criticize all new medicine after the Jinyuan, this is not related to the presence of the test [18]. The most important achievements of Chinese medicine pharmacy in the Qing Dynasty are about acute infectious diseases. It has formed a new system, namely temperature pathology. The appearance of this student, although it is based on the achievements of the Chinese doctor, the contribution of the Qing Dynasty temperature sick school in the history of TCM, is still quite obvious, it is not a \"typhisticalism\", Jin Dynasty Liu Yuen's school school [18].\n\nSince the end of the Qing Dynasty, modern medicine [19] began in China, seriously impacted the development of Chinese medicine. Starting a situation in China and Western medicine. Modern, Chinese medicine is still one of the common means of treating disease in China.\n\nAfter being impacted by the West, most believes that Chinese medicine is a prefaciated medicine, but in the 1950s, Traditional Chinese medicine began to introduce Western medicine research systems, and re-explained Chinese medicine through scientific analysis of the principles of the course, but so systematically The finishing, imported Western organism, molecular medicine, etc. have achieved modern Chinese medicine, from empty yin and yang, and changed to the focus of learning.\n\nAs a part of Chinese medicine acupuncture as traditional Chinese medicine, there is an interest in the medical community. Some scholars believe that acupuncture has been confirmed to reduce the pain after surgery, the nausea and vomiting produced by anti-stomach during pregnancy, and tooth pain is effective. And its side effect is very low, acupuncture is very significant, and the efficacy of neurological diseases is very significant. [20]. The World Health Organization (Abb: WHO) believes that only some of the traditional pharmaceutical contained acupuncture and herbs are more powerful results in clinical experiments, other traditional medications and herbs still need further research, and cannot ignore traditional therapies. The risk of safety and danger, even to poke a medicinal material, and the anesthetic, toxin accumulation in the biology has been gradually discovered that it is proven to be able to make it awkward, so that the case of death has been staged many times. Because it is the underground economy, there is a problem of pretending to get a fake medicine [21]. WHO issued \"2002-2005 Traditional Medicine Research Global Strategy on May 26, 2002\", inviting 180 countries in the world to incorporate medical policies in the country.\n\nThe WHO World Health Assembly will launch the 11th Edition Global Medical Outline in 2019, and the traditional Chinese medicine is included in it. This means that Chinese medicine is in the world or among the mainstream therapies, not only supplementary therapies other than surgery, radiotherapy, etc.\nThe global medical outline is also known as \"statistical classification of international diseases and related health issues\" (ICD), which has great influence in a global scale. [twenty two]\n\nThe theory of Chinese medicine can be divided into three periods in accordance with its theoretical foundation, respectively, and the Tournament is still in the period of the book, and the ancient Chinese book.\nOur mainstream society today is the \"Yellow Emperor's Internal Classics\" representatives represented by this book. Han Wudi's postgraduated three passers-by, promoting this literature. Later, the Emperor of Han Dynasty won the son of Han Jing Emperor Liu Yu bad, and the ancient text of the Lecix is \u200b\u200blater. In short: \"Ancient Wen Shangshu\" and the emergence of \"this article\" are related to the Han Dynasty. After the Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, the soup liquid was hidden in the folk, and only this scriptor was circulated. In the early twentieth century, \"the anti-medicine treatment of the auxiliary medicine\" is unearthed. Recently discovered the basic theory of the soup through the law. In the timing, the soup liquid is earlier, followed by this book, the book and ancient book, and Xu Shen mentioned \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" Yan Song's Note \"Three Kingdoms \u00b7 Wu Zhi\" is called \"This article\", this is \"a\" hear \", misunderstanding text.) Ouyang said, liver, wood; heart, fire; spleen, earth; lung, gold Also; kidney, water is also. Ancient \"Shangshu\" said that spleen, wood is also; lung, fire is also; heart, earth, liver, gold also; kidney, water also. Xu Shen case, \"month\" Spring Festival, summer Sacrifies the lungs, the summer, the autumn festival, the winter, the winter, the kidney, the ancient \"Shangshu\" is the same. Zheng Hui Yun: \"Month Order\" offers four times, and its five hidden ears. Winter is in winter After, and the kidney is under; the summer is in front, and the lungs are on; the spring is small, the sacrifice is the first spleen; the autumn is small, so the sacrifice is also a liver. The kidney is also, the spleen is also, the \u9b32; lung, The heart is also, the liver is also awkward. The sacrifice will be three, so there is a first-minded, there is no way to be the same as the five elements. Today's medical disease, the liver is wood, the heart is fire, the spleen is the soil, the lungs are gold, The kidney is water, there is also a jealous. If the anti-its surgery, it is not dead as a drama. (\"Book\" 13 \"month\" justice) \"The ancient Wen Shangshu is passed by Fusheng, and this article is passed by Ouyang and Bo. Clinical experiments have proven that the soup liquid is consistent with the human fluid taste of the human body.\nThis proves that the popular Chinese medicine theory foundation is actually the book of this euro, and the five elements say that it is in Qi, the Warring States Period, and the five elements are said to be Liu Xiang period, so the perfect Huangdi internal completion time It is impossible to earlier than the Han Xuan Emperor. Later, the soup liquid was used to refer to the fairy home. It adopts this famous book called the medical home or called the needle, using this famous book and soup liquid to be called the manuscript.\nThe following is a comparison of three different Chinese traditional Chinese medicine theories:\n\nAmong the original Chinese medicine theories in the \"Soup Solve Dynasties\", it is a total of 16 gossip in the \"Turtle\" gossip and \"Dragon Map\" in the Yin Shang period. Where is the place where the yin and yang is the opposite. In the \"soup liquid\" or Yin Shang orthodox philosophy: spring and summer is Yin, autumn and winter is Yang. Take the lungs, the sun is in the sun, and the spleen is small and the fire, and the liver is hurting less. Should be 4: Spring pulse, summer, autumn, winter sink.\n\nThe theory of this literary school is from the summary of Confucianism and the literary school and the five elements of Confucian Yinyang. Its content includes essentials, yin and yang five-way learning, gas-blood, Tibetan, meridians, physical fitness, cause, pathogenesis, pathogenesis, rules, health, etc. Not earlier than the Western Han Dynasty, the \"Yellow Emperor\" came out, laid the foundation of Confucian medical theory. Today, the traditional Chinese medicine related theory, diagnostic method, treatment method, etc. can be found in this book.\n\nThe traditional Chinese medicine has a complete Confucian theoretical system, and its unique place is that Dong Zhongshu proposed, \"Heaven and Man\", \"Heaven and Man\", \"Tianshi\". The main features are:\n\nThe five elements said that it is an important achievement in the Warring States Confucian philosophy, five lines, fire, soil, gold, water, but this does not represent five substances, but the five properties of the substance.\n\nThe five lines of Chinese medicine reflect the relationship between the five major systems of these five attributes. The five symbols of the wood fire soil gold represent the five major systems leading to liver, heart, spleen, lung and kidney. Chinese medicine is not studying how micro virus bacteria acts on the theory of the human body, but to study the relationship between the overall environment of the human body and the various systems, and adjust the balance between the systems through Chinese medicine, massage, acupuncture, and even psychological effects to adjust the balance between the systems. This keeps your health.\n\nThe \"Decoction of the Decoction\" is a Chinese medicine school heard since Yin Shang, and the party representative [24]. This set of theory is a considerable difference between the Confucian derived version of the art. For example, there is no five-way theory in the \"Soup Solver Law\" school, using a sixteenth to learn, and among the Yinyang is against this literary call. The following theoretical restore is from Hong Kong's historian Chen Zhenming, \"by\" the internal medicine of the medicine \"to\" to Hong Kong's contemporary new ejection \". [25]\n\nThe \"Decoction of the Decoction\" school is based on the \"immediate measurement\", and the length of the sun is the sun, the sun is short of Yin.\n\nDeduced:\n\nLi Chun is a yinkun, and the spring is divided into less yin.\n\nListeak is the Yangtze Sky, summer solstice is too yin.\n\nLi Qiu is the sun of Shaoyang, and the autumn is divided into Shaoyang.\n\nEstablish winter is the yin of the sun, and the winter solstice is dry for the sun.\n\nSpring weather, summer heat, autumn cool, winter temperate.\nSpring is a small thermal fire, summer is too hot, autumn is less Yangliang, winter is the sun.\n\nSpring, summer, autumn, winter sink.\n\nFour positive, spleen and liver and kidney.\nSiki, stomach heart.\n\nThe south is the dragon, the north is phoenix, the East is a turtle, and the West is Lin.\n\nSpring Gold is the spleen and stomach, the summer wood is the pulmonary heart, autumn water is the hepatic gallbladder, and the winter is the kidney intestine.\n\nLi Chun is the stomach gold, color white Kun.\nSpring is spleen, color yellow.\nLixia is a heart, color green.\nSummer to the lung wood, color green earthquake.\nLiqiu is bile water, black dry.\nAutumn is a liver water, color blue.\nThe winter is the intestinal fire, and the color is red.\nWinter solstice for kidney fire, coloring red cream.\n\nChunjin is the spleen, the summer wood is lung, autumn water is liver, and the winter is kidney.\nThe taste is a wood, the taste is a fire, the taste is gold, the taste is a water.\n\nPulmonary main gas, kidney blood, spleen, liver maintenance.\n\nThe lungs are hi, the spleen is angry, the liver is worried, the kidney is fear.\n\nWhen diagnosing the treatment of disease, take the method, symptoms, and signs of the four diagnosis, smell, ask, cut four consultations, symptoms, and signs of disease, nature, part, and evil Relationship, summarization, determination as a \"certificate\" of a certain nature, to explore the essence of the disease, thereby concluding, and determines the treatment principles and specific governance. This method is different from simple local symptomatic treatment, and is different from non-division, inseparable, no nature, one, one, a disease, a disease.\n\nThe treatment means and methods are rich in many, including general inner medicines, there are external treatment, hot iron, fumigation, etc., and unique acupuncture, cupping, massage, massage, Qigong, cloth, etc. Drug therapy, and daily food therapy represented by medicated diet.\n\nIn general, the complete Chinese medicine prescription, at least four or more: emotion (emotional control) guidance; taboo (diet should pay attention); sports advice (swimming, running, guiding, Qigong, etc.); Chinese medicine Use, or acupuncture, moxibustion (formerly agreed with acupuncture), massage, etc. Therefore, in the treatment of diseases, Chinese medicine is a full consideration with the angle of mind and mental.\n\nA number of traditional drug injection preparations have been emerged in recent years, which are used for muscles and intravenous injection. In addition, most drugs are naturally movable, planted, minerals, non-artificial synthetic chemicals, plus more compound preparations, and the corresponding antagonistic measures can be employed.\n\nCompared to traditional Chinese medicine, the inventions of modern Chinese medicine practitioners include small needles, traditional drug injection preparations, scientific Chinese medicine, etc.\n\nFrom the weeks, there are foods, disease doctors, ulcer, veterinary deposits. The Tai Medical Department of the Sui and Tang Dynasties is divided into medical and pharmaceutical, medical, medical, joys, massage, curse; medical treatment, small, small, sore, ear-top-ended, angle, etc. Song Taishang's medical education initial square, needle, ulcertia, Song Shenzong, divided into nine sects, namely, the fondang, small veins, Fengke, obstetric, ophthalmology, tetrey, sore throat, sore and survival\u79d1, \u9488 and moxibustion, Jin Yu and Branch. Yuan Tai Hospital is divided into ten sects and is 10 disciplines: that is, the generic medicine department, small ceremonial department, Fengke, obstetric and women's miscellaneous, ophthalmology, tenthopharyngology, orthodynum , Acupuncture and Division, I wish you all the best. The Ming Tai Hospital is divided into thirteen: the big square, the small veins, women, typhoid fever, sore, denture, throat, bone, golden, eye, acupuncture, massage, and wish. Qingyai Hospital's first eleven sects, and then the nine sects: the large square, small, women, typhoid fever, sore, oral teeth, orthose, eye, acupuncture. Dao Guang two years (1822): \"It is advisable to do the\" need to pierculate the fire and moxity \", and the Tai Hospital will abolish the acupuncture department. Tongzhi will , Woman, typhoon and is a department, so only five subjects.\n\nThe ancient Chinese medicine is divided into internal medicine, foreign medicine.\n\nModern Chinese medicine can be divided into basic medicine and clinical medicine\n\nChinese medicine is divided into medical treatment, medical treatment, grass, medical, medical case, medical treatment, etc., such as \"Yellow Emperor\", \"It's a Treaty\", \"Golden Chambers\", \"Shennong Herb\" , \"Multi-gold\", \"Compendium of Materia Medica\", \"Name Medical Case\".\n\nIn \"Han Shu, Yi Wenzhi\", divide the doctor into the \"medical\", \"party\", \"god\", \"housing\" four geography. Since the development, it can be divided into eight geography: the tattoory school, the rivers, the Yi water school, the attacking, the Danxi school, the temperature supplement, the temperature sick school, the Chinese and Western Huitong School.\n\nFrom ancient times, well-known and legendary Chinese medicine practitioners: (See: List of Chinese Medicine)\n\n\u5c90 \u4f2f,, Zhang Zhongjing, Hua Wei, Wang Shuhe, Tao Hongjing, Sun Sizhen, Song Ci, Liu Yu, Zhang Zi Zheng, Li Wei, Zhu Zhenheng, Zhang Jingyue, Fu Mountain, Ye Gui, Chen Xiuyuan, Cao Ying, Yu Shu, Tang Rongchuan, Qin Bo , Zhang Qiangong, Zhao Shaoqin, Zhang Jizhai, Shi Xiangxu, Chengmen Xue, Pu Fu Zhou, Zuoji Yun, Zheng Shouquan, talking about Yixian, etc.\n\nSince modern medical (also known as Western medicine), with missionary, the competition and integration of the two medical systems have been in progress.\n\nThe medical system in the world can be roughly divided:\n\n\"Plavidism Medical System\" (Theology): It is believed that the occurrence of disease is due to the strength of the supernatural (Shen Ling), such as Satan, Ghost, God, Witch Doctor, Children, Curse, etc.\n\n\"Nature Medical System\" (experienced medicine): Think the disease occurs due to changes in the natural environment or causes abnormal lifestyle, such as changes in climate, eating habits, human emotional changes. Chinese medicine, life spending vs., homeopathic, etc. belong to this class.\n\n\"Scientific Medicine System\" (experimental design): It is the mainstream of modern medicine, such as the medical instrument detection, or the medical instrument detection, or the medical instrument detection.\n\nThe front two are classified as traditional medicine or alternative medicine, while the latter is the mainstream of modern medicine.\n\nThese three types of medicine have essentially the difference in the understanding of the world, and the bottom concept is different, so it is basically unable to communicate between each other:\n\nIn the world of \"Plavidism Medicine\", people are inferior, all the truth, the mystery of the universe is to master the mysterious power in the unable to specifically, and humans want to have a certain period, can only ask this unable to control my mysterious power. .\n\nIn the world of \"Nature Medicine\", people are at your own risk, think that the universe runs in the simple principle, the principle is universal, and all the mystery of the human body also follows. As long as the principle is grasped, all problems in the world can analyze and solve, and medicine is no exception. And it is considered that the principle has been found, and people only need to follow the execution, they can solve any problems.\n\nIn the world of \"scientificism\", people are not humble, and empirical empirics for objective world is the only standard. If the operation of things is objective and regular, people can attribute organisms through experience, logic, and empirical ways, to grasp the law and obtain the ability to deal with certain problems.\n\nTCM diagnosis disease is the result of understanding the destruction, but there is also a diagnosis of illnesses (such as emergency or special illnesses), or only discreating, illness (for example, unknown diseases , Incurable diseases, or conditioning the body, etc.). Different from modern medicine on \"disease\" in diagnosis, Chinese medicine often emphasizes \"dismissal (symptoms).\"\n\nTaking a cold as an example, the modern medical physician will distinguish between viral or bacterial infection, which will identify the upper respiratory tract infection or combined with pneumonia; but these diagnostics are not most important to Chinese medicine practitioners. With the point of view of Chinese medicine, it is necessary to distinguish it. This is a cold or wind hot; if it is a cold, it is a solar disease, Yangming or less state of sickness; which stage of the disease is from the blood of the disease Wait.\n\nTraditional Chinese medicine mainly passes traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture and other treatment methods, helping the human body to drive evil spirits and restore normal gas. Its thinking can be simply two categories, depending on the condition, the attack or supplement, or the attack. Traditionally, clinical attacks have eight methods, namely \"sweating, spit, lower, and warm, clear, fill, elimination\", called eight methods.\n\nOne of the value of Chinese medicine is that the prescription is the experience of the doctor. The process of the development of Chinese medicine itself is the experimental medicine, especially for hundreds of years after numerous doctors, and even the clinical human experiment of the millennium has confirmed the actual effective and recorded scriptures. Directly facing the disease, master the main symptoms, select the symptomatic prescription to reduce or subtraction, not in theory, to treat disease, this is the original face of Chinese medicine.\n\nModern Chinese medicine also has the use of Chinese and Western medicine combined treatment, especially in mainland China, using modern medical testing methods to assist in diagnosis, Chinese medicine practitioners can use traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine for patient treatment.\n\nIn the Chinese cultural circle, some patients usually have diseases such as unknown diseases, chronic diseases, and causes such as unknown disease, or because of the development of modern medicine, or the medical resource that the patient can obtain, there is no treatment Will help to the Chinese medicine. But most people have helped modern medicine in surgery, and frequent patients with rapid lesions.\n\nA disease may be cured, and how much the probability is, which has a clear statistical number in modern medicine than in traditional Chinese medicine.\n\nTraditionally, Chinese medicine judges the efficacy by changes in pulse and patient taking drugs. Some Chinese medicine believe that Chinese medicine is difficult to conduct comparison, but modern research on Chinese medicine, and establish a variety of experimental animal models or enters clinical human experiments, compare the test, to verify the efficacy of Chinese medicine or Chinese medicine.\n\nModern medicine treatment methods and agents are to confirm the effects through scientific contrast tests (such as using placebo contrast).\n\nIn recent years, in Taiwan, all major teaching hospitals or regional hospitals are generally opened, and the Ministry of Traditional Chinese Medicine is opened and the task of clinical trials in traditional Chinese medicine. For example, \"Supresses, III, III, September 24th, 2006,\" Seminar \", Director Yang Xianhong, director of the North District of Chang Gung Hospital, issued\" Xinyi Treatment of allergic rhinitis random double-blind clinical effect evaluation \" In a two-year double-blind experiment, a total of 108 patients were collected, and 60 of the total experiment were completed, including 40 experimental groups, 20 control groups, and for clinical symptoms, nasal resistance, nasal cross-sectional area, dust Statistical analysis of various indicators such as secretion of mites specific immunoglobulin and T lymphocyte hormone. The results showed that Xinyi tuned patients with patients with allergic rhinitis have clinical efficacy. The machine transition of this efficacy includes the immunoassay of T cells and the effects of neutrophil activity [26]. This is one of the many scientific research proof of traditional Chinese medicine science and its medical value. Other representative Chinese medicine research verification results also recorded public and detailed records in the website of the Chinese Academy of Health Department of Sanhua Medicine Committee [27], providing interesters to see Chinese medicine and clinical results.\n\nMost of the books of Chinese medicine in ancient times, such as the \"Yellow Emperor\" in the Warring States Period, Eastern Han Dynasty \"Treatys\", the Ming Dynasty's \"Materia Medica\", using the gentle words, and the song, the song, the song is not easy to understand, and Increase the difficulty of propagation. Ancient Chinese officials have also continued to collect all kinds of traditional Chinese medicine books, become a special medical book, and have an examination system, and in the private manner inheritance. In modern times, it is established in TCM or college, and the system is organized, studied, teaching, and in the private man, also retains some of the divisions and home transmission methods.\n\nA very different place in traditional Chinese medicine and modern medicine is the experience of Chinese medicine attention to the ancients. Chinese medicine practitioners promote the ancient Chinese medical books, and the opposite of modern medicine has also focused on medical development.\n\nModern medicine continues to introduce new and open new drugs. On the one hand, the Chinese medicine specializes in the ancient secret recipe, the medical book, and the collections, and adopts, from the ancient people, and continue to be reviewed and used, on the other hand, it is constantly based on the party or time, for different diseases in the clinic The addition and decrease is carried out, develop new prescriptions, or by changing the dosage form, such as a traditional Chinese medicine injection preparation, to expand the treatment range of the prescription or enhance its efficacy.\n\nModern medicine is based on the knowledge system of the text, if a treatment or the drug is not or effective, this knowledge can quickly spread. Modern use of network and dissemination media, as well as the establishment of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the establishment of Chinese Medicine Research Institute, various examples of traditional Chinese medicine also gradually spread.\n\nGenerally speaking [who? Experienced old Chinese medicine medical skills, experience has a significant decisive role in the effect. Due to the disturbance of Chinese medicine, the vocabulary of Chinese philosophy in Chinese philosophy is to make it difficult for experience. In the Chinese medicine classics such as medical, this grass, medical case, and medical treatment, all kinds of prescriptions, Chinese medicine use timing, artillery method, use taboo, side effects, symptoms and treatment methods, such as Qing Chen Xiuyuan's annotation of \"Shen Nong Hard Medicine Read\" Volume 4, \"Today, I am confused by money, Biki Pulmonary geka, use (Maota Bell) to treat the falseness, hundreds of people .\n\nIn China, whether there is a scientific problem in Chinese medicine, it has always been arguing. The controversy of the academia dates back to the end of the 19th century, and some people who advocate medical modernization after modern medicine, and advocated abolishing Chinese medicine, and traditional Chinese medicine was challenged. Until today, whether Chinese medicine is in science, and whether Chinese medicine is effective, etc., remains doubled by the mainstream scientific community [28].\n\nSince the European medicine Dongchuan, the Chinese medicine is scientific and the dispute is extremely large [29].\n\nIn 1879, Yu Wei issued the \"waste medicine\" first put forward the claims to abolish traditional Chinese medicine. In 1915, Yuan Guisheng, Jiangsu, the \"Waste 5\" as a proposal to share the Shenzhou Medical Association, entitled \"proposed to scrapped five proposal\" [30]. According to the medical semi-column, it may be the earliest article to abolish the two-line theory.\n\nIn 1926, Lu Xun once wrote \"father's disease (page archive backup, existed in Internet Archive), and criticized some problems in Chinese medicine.\n\nIn 1929, the National Government passed the \"abolition of old doctors to remove medical health care\" proposed by Yu Yunzhen. However, under the pressure of public opinion in the country, the National Government subsequently recovered the life [31].\n\nIn 2005, Professor Zhang Gong Yao, Central South University, published \"Say Bifidi Chinese Medicine\" in \"Medical and Philosophical\" magazine.\n\nChina's official statement believes that Chinese medicine is a science. In response to Chinese medicine unscientific, Jing Zhiwei believes that \"November 19, 2005, the country changed its name to the Chinese Traditional Chinese Medicine\", which is also a return on these arguments. \"[32] Dong Jian Dong believes\" in modern scientific demultiplexing Standards are in non-sciences, and they are different from pseudo science \"[33]. Sun Xuegang, etc., considers according to the scientific demociation standards in Said, and \"can't say Chinese medicine is a science\" [34].\n\nThere are still some people believe that Chinese medicine stems from the ancient people's sensibility and sensory understanding of the law of human body and nature, its nature is not narrow science (but can use appropriate modern scientific methods to research and play some Chinese medicine theories), but it has super off One side of science. And \"not scientific\" cannot deny the efficacy of TCM therapy. If there is, we will have a lot of valuable cultural assets [35] [36] [37].\n\nOthers, such as Fang Zhouzi, think that the efficacy of TCM claims is also worthy of suspicion [38]. The effects of placebo and human autologous immunity cannot be excluded because there is no support recognized by modern medicine. And he pointed out that some Chinese medicine believers have more ridiculous mistakes, and many Chinese medicine is not from clinical experience, but from the fetching witchcraft thinking. [39]\n\nCurrently, many scientific media, if shells, cloves, doctor [40], etc., and many science authors and some netizens, they also hold a position on Chinese medicine. Such as negative the theoretical significance and efficacy of Chinese medicine, or advocates the abolition of the theory of traditional Chinese medicine and use modern scientific methods to inspect and explain some of the treatment techniques or drugs of traditional Chinese medicine (referred to as \"waste medicine for drug administration).\n\nIn 2019, Hong Kong's historian Chen Zhenming was in the \"secondary medicine to use medicine\" to Hong Kong contemporary new economics [25]\nIt is pointed out the source of Confucian political philosophy of yin and yang, and the contents of \"The Soup Solid Skulls\" is restored to the \"Decoction of Decoction\" and derived the \"Yellow Emperor's Internal Classics\" and Yin and Yang Five Theory as the Basic Theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine.\n\nIn 1929, at a failed attempt to abolish the Chinese medicine, the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Pharmaceutist was established as \"Chinese National Medical Festival\" on March 17, in order to celebrate this victory. This is a holiday related to Chinese medicine.\n\n\nChinese medicine "}
