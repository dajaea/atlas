The early days of the Republic of China is referred to as national surgery (after the name of the Central Columbus, the Taiwan is also used in this name), which is considered to be the essence of Chinese culture, so it is also known as \"national quintes\". Due to historical development and regional distribution relationship, different genres are derived.

In 1984-1993, there were two top Chinese Chinese national competitions, and there were two kinds of performances and fight competitions. The three sides of the strait and the international representative of the \"City\" grade, each country is not necessarily each \"city\" \"There are representatives, but each ninth (45kg level to 85 kg) event has more than one hundred representatives to compete for sixty-four, and it is very feat; the competition will end due to the political contradiction between the two sides.

In 1990, martial arts was first included in the eleventh \"Asian Games\" competition project. In 1999, International Wuling was absorbed as a member of the official International Sports Senior Association of the International Olympic Committee, which is a sign of Chinese martial arts toward the world.\n\nAt present, the Wushu Movement Management Center (formerly known as the Martial Arts Management Center of the People's Republic of China) and the National Sports General Administration Institute (originally known as the Chinese Wushu Institute).

Therefore, the martial arts competition is criticized as a performance \"dance\", no practical hit, just the gymnastics of Huayuan embroidered legs. At present, there are 114 Member States in the International Martial Arts Union. Therefore, China officially launched a Sanda Movement since the 1980s.

In the early days of the Qing Dynasty, the development of the above two major systems were mixed.\n\nWhen Qianlong, the Tai Chi Boxing was a simplified long boxing system with five lines of gossip and other ideas, the same farewell boxes will be boxed. Mixed above three major systems play out modern boxing system, including Wing Chun, Dacheng, Jamaday, and now Wu Xu, Emei.\n\nThe study of Chinese martial arts is currently enrolled in the martial arts or some martial arts teaching venues. Traditional martial artists studying in the people still maintain many ancient traditions, need someone to recommend, then post the post to worship the teacher. Although it has rarely \"three years old, the teacher is three years\", it will still have a long observation period, let the master understand whether the apprentice can teach; let the apprentiuses understand whether the master's work can learn .\n\nThe cultivation of Chinese martial arts, all gates are different. It is generally included basic skills, routines, internal strength and external work. In particular, the internal strength and external work are regarded as the most important content by all the factions. The statement of \"inspiring one breath, external practice bone skin\", refuses to show people, even if their apprentices are not necessarily pouring . [Source Request]\n\nIn terms of internal strength, the main Chinese medicine theory is the meridian of Chinese medicine. TCM believes that \"meridians are the table, the organs of the organs\", cultivating the meridians, will have the effect of conditioning, consolidating and enhancing the viscera. The internal strength of Chinese martial arts is mainly inner gas, and meridians are channels running in the internal gas. The intra gas is operated in a manner in a manner. It will cause the meridian itself, the corresponding organs, and the whole body to adjust, consolidate, and enhanced. effect. [Source Request]\n\nIn terms of external work, many external practices should be aid with drugs. The auxiliary role is mainly divided into auxiliary practice, healing, conditioning and enhanced body corresponding parts and organs. The action of drugs generally includes multiple aspects therein.\n\nThe basic work of Chinese martial arts is different. Generally there is station pile, such as station horse step; a method of flexibility of various exercise limbs (similar to the training method of modern other sports projects); some basic movements and basic routines practice. This is for traditional martial arts. For the current routine martial arts, it has certain athletes, and directly learning the routine action, and pays attention to the basic skills of traditional martial arts.\n\nThe basic skills of Chinese martial arts pay attention to \"the body of the hand, the spiritual power\". There is a punch, palm, hook, \"four hits eight law 12\".\n\nIt is mainly to use breathing, Tunne, luck, and make an intention to focus and cooperate with physical action to enhance the effect of attack and defensive action.\n\nInternal work practice: Most of ordinary people cultivation as a method of strong body fitness. If you have long-term persistence and practice your ability, you can make your spirits, the whole body is highly comfortable, and your body can be enhanced. If you do a long-term exercise as a masterbatch, you can significantly increase the muscle explosive [source request], and enhance the physical strength [source request]. Some major genre, there are efforts to make internal gas. [Source Request]\n\nBecause Chinese folk thinking is far from the past. Taoism has a statement that the big horizon (the world) and the small universe (body) can communicate with each other, so there is so-called Qigong or internal practice. In this context, some martial arts schools in China also have \"raise\", \"training\", \"luck\". At first, the internal strength is not the content of Chinese martial arts. After a long development, it is gradually combined with Qigong.\n\nDifferent genities have the same understanding of \"qi\", but the difference in the imagination of the atmosphere is similar to the imagination of the atmosphere. It is similar to the gas in the theory of Chinese medicine, but is different from air or other gases in modern science. The internal gas is also known as \"real gas\" or \"qi\", and the internal gas is roughly divided into two categories of motion and moving. The former has a certain action routine with breathing, the idea is enhanced to the internal gas, promoted, and widely flowing. Such as Tai Chi, etc .; the latter mainly rely on breathing and ideas to achieve the same purpose. The latter is more difficult. Also, due to depth conditions, it is susceptible to external interference (that is, the so-called \"fire into the magic\"). [Source Request]\n\nMainly to exercise the intensity of the bone skin, the use of practicing hands, eyes, body, steps and shoulders, elbows, wrists, knee, and knees, to strengthen the power of attacks and defensive movements.\n\nThe practice method is similar to those similar to other skills, and it is repeatedly hit a certain hardness goal or repeatedly hit it. However, in Chinese martial arts, traditional Chinese medicine practicing is also an important role, including healing and Conditioning the body.\n\nEffect of external work: The purpose of external work is to increase its own fight against the fight, and the other is to increase the power of attack. Because martial arts as a combat combat mean has already basically disappeared, only a few people are practicing external work. The content of the disclosed performance and armed police training includes a brick slamming the head, the brick is broken and the head is not damaged. Over earlier periods on external public performances have a performance in which the knife guns in the period and group.\n\nChinese martial arts a more significant feature is that there are many sets of roads. The routine is a series of actions containing the actions of martial arts and attack defense. All their families have many sets of jackets that express their own portals, and the routine is gradual, and the junctions of beginners and practicing people learn are different. At present, although the martial arts athletes will learn very different sets of routines, it is not clear for their hit and attack and defense.\n\nIn traditional martial arts, there are many initials in the early days of the routine, let the learners feel the meaning of luck, and the impact of the attack. And this practice is repeatedly carried out, and it is necessary to carefully understand the effect of the movement in the actual anti-reflex, it can carefully understand the effect. For example, Guo Yunxiao, who is known as \"half-step collapse to play the world\", and the enemy always uses a moving collapse, and strictly just half a move, but it is enough to defeat the opponent.\n\nThe main source of martial arts instruments is the weapons of the cold weapons, such as swords, knives, guns, sticks, etc. In ancient China, the sword once is the most important short weapon on the battlefield, which will give the knife. The martial artists have the most widely studied instruments with swords and knives.\n\nOther martial arts instruments include non-combat weapons such as moth eyebird, nunchakows, or some daily life, such as embroidery needles, stone mill, iron pot, sickle, umbrella, and so on.\n\nChinese martial arts always give people a mysterious color. This is of course the impact of martial arts novels and kungfu films. However, China's martial arts itself is due to the impact of traditional traditional partial laws (see \"Chinese Martial Arts - History and Culture\"), most of them are secret teaching, and the crucial place is even more than the words, but the teacher is said. Therefore, just in accordance with books, basically it is impossible to truly learn. It is also because of this, many boxes have gradually extracted, slowly become a topic of Yi Wen or Square.\n\nChinese martial arts is very different in the performance of martial arts and martial arts in other regions. China's martial arts is a different level of competition. Therefore, Chinese martial arts produces an empty hand in an empty hand of an empty hand and a weapon, and the martial arts used in the plane, and the hidden instruments used when the passenger does not preparation. Wait. Even the monkey fist also has a leg gate Also absorbed.\n\nThe actual combat fight of Chinese martial arts is exaggerated due to literature and movies. The handicrafts between martial artists use the form of push hands, point until. And the truly struggle is not like a lot of people to understand, and it is half a day, and most of them are only a few rounds.\n\nIn terms of actual competition, the existing Chinese traditional martial arts programming film information can be found in an embarrassment, whether it is Chinese martial arts against modern struggle or with foreign skills exchange, most traditional martial arts players or participation People often have a trick to the double boxing, the legs make the legs like a scattered leg or a blank handkerchief, and even the scene that caught the opponent and wants a lot of fell, and even more people can see the game The two are almost close to the village fighting of martial arts, and the traditional martial arts exquisite technology did not see. The demonstration is a matter of routine dismantling. In fact, the game is playing again, and it can see the boxing, the kick, the mutant, the power to see the power and momentum Not as far as shed.\n\nWhat kind of realm of Chinese martial arts can practice, it is a problem that is difficult to answer. According to Taijiquan's statement, the highest realm can reach \"a feather can't be added, mosquito can't fall\", that is, a feathers encountered his body, can be bounced in him. But can anyone can achieve this ideal realm?\n\nChinese martial arts is one of the important collective memories of Chinese society. It has often emerged in various literature, movies and drama, and has a deep and uncharacted humanistic meaning against Chinese society. In addition, due to the relationship between globalization, Chinese martial arts often appear in European and American movies and TV programs, and it is an important foot of Chinese culture by Europe and the United States.\n\nEverything in modern Chinese is talking about Chinese martial arts, often paying great attention to the philosophical spirit of it. Most people who love Chinese martial arts have attached importance to \"ethics and value of martial arts\", or called Wu De.\n\nTraditional martial arts, the first \"respecting teacher\", teach people to do good, practice martial arts purpose is to exercise the body, self-defeating, and then weaken, the safeguards.\n\nOften some people will quote \"Tang Ge as Wu\" to explain the humanistic spirit of Chinese martial arts. According to \"Zuo Chuan Xuan Gong Twelve Years\": \"Fuwen, Tengang is Wu Wu\", mostly said that China's Chinese characters \"Wu\", composed of two words \"stop\" and \"Goro\", thus interpreting The true value of \"Wu\" is not to kill damage, but for later peace. Although the source of \"Wu\" word is explained, for example, some people think that \"Tong\" \"toe\" is \"hand\", \"toe\" picking up \"Gao\" for the fight. But many people like to explain the part of the spirit of Chinese martial arts.\n\nRegardless of martial arts, novelists, movies, often emphasize the value of Chinese martial arts: \"Kung Fu is not used to fight, but use it as a strong body.\" When the martial artists learn the skill, it should be \"point until\", and should not be chaotic. The people who will, \"don't worry about the dryness\", you must \"quit the use of our urgent use\" because martial arts should not use active injuries, but should only \"as self-defense purposes when necessary.\" As for the country, when the country is in danger, it is the time when the husband is responsible.\n\nWe can sum up Chinese martial arts for the Chinese meaning, in:\n\nChinese martial arts, in China's modern and popular literature, movie works, and then derived from martial arts novels and action movies.\n\nIn these works, Chinese martial arts often have the following role:\n\nIn fact, people who write the above works often do not really understand Chinese martial arts. Some of the martial arts movements, the martial arts genre is the subject, and others refer to some legendary martial arts, and some are more martial arts content that creates Tiama. In fact, there are many martial arts (such as flying walls, point acupuncture, closing mountains, etc.) in various stories, are all tricks, but under the rendering of the story, these movements have been out of reality. It is far away.\n\nMany cultural analysis believes that this is reflecting the weakness and depression of modern people in society, making people seeking to overst the human body strength to defeat anxiety, and and mechanical civilizations in the real society.
