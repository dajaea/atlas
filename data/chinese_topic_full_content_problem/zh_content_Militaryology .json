{"chinese_title": "Militaryology ", "chinese": "Tip: The theme of this entry is not mineral.\n Various types of minerals\nMinerals refer to a naturally formed crystalline purified purified (single or compound) under geological action. The absolute pure substance is not present, so the pure substance here refers to the relatively single substance of the substance chemistry. Minerals are the foundation of the rocks (like quartz, long stone, and square solutions are common \u9020 \u5ca9), but minerals and rocks are different, and minerals can be expressed in their chemical formations, while rocks are synthesized by many minerals and non-minerals. Nothing Chemical formula.\nMost of the minerals are non-organized inorganic compounds, typically solid, organized, but also liquid minerals, such as mercury (mercury). The precise definition of minerals is still controversial, and there is a controversial is the two conditions of non-organisms, and the ordered atomic structure. Like minerals such as brown mines, obsidian, but there is no crystalline, it is called quasi-minerals.\nThe natural science of minerals is known as mineralogue. The mineral known in the world (English: List of minerals (complete)) has more than 5,300, of which 5,070 have been approved by the International Mineral Academy (IMA). More than 75% of the crust is composed of and oxygen, so many minerals are silicate minerals. Minerals can distinguish between physical properties and chemical properties, can be divided into several categories according to their chemical composition and crystal structure, and factors such as temperature pressure during mineral formation can affect some of them. The temperature, pressure, and changes in the rocks, will affect the minerals. It is also possible that the main components of the minerals are constant, but the minerals are varied due to temperature pressure changes.\nMinerals can be described in many physical properties, and these properties are also related to their chemical structures and composition. Common mineral physical properties include crystal structures and crystals, hardness, gloss, transparency, colors, bar marks, toughness, deconsive, fracture, fracture, and proportion. Further characteristics include reactions, magnetic, odor, or flavors of acid, and radioactivity.\nMinerals can be classified according to their primary chemical composition, and the main two classification systems are Strunz mineral classification and DANA mineral classification. The silicate can be subjected to six small classes according to the homogeneous polymorphicity of its chemical structure. All silicate has [SiO4] 4-laves, a silicon atom and four oxygen atoms, is bonded in a four-dimensional manner. The silicate can also be divided into stock salts (OrthoSilicates, no polymerization), silicate (Disilicates, two silicate polymerization), cyclic silicate (cyclosilicates, cyclic silicate), Chain silicate (inosilicates, chain-shaped silicate), laminated silicate (phyllosilicates, layered silicate) and web silicate (Tectosilicates, three-dimensional silicate structure). Other important minerals have natural elements (English: Native Element Minerals), sulfides (English: sulfide minerals), oxides (English: oxide minerals), halide (English: halide minerals), carbonate, sulfate (English) : Sulfate minerals, phosphate (English: sulfate minerals).\n\ntable of Contents\n\n1 difference between minerals and rocks\n2 mineral classification\n3 physical properties\n\n3.1 Crystal structure and crystal inertia\n3.2 hardness\n3.3 Gloss and Transparency\n3.4 proportion\n3.5\n3.6 Other features\n\n\n4 related categories\n5 See\n6 footnote\n7 References\n8 external connection\n\n\nDifferences between minerals and rocks [edit]\nMinerals are naturally formed pure substances or compounds, and the chemical constituents are not large, and there is a crystallization structure.

The crystal structure is arranged in accordance with internal atoms or ions, and often named in the geometric shape of the crystal. Even if the mineral grains are too small, or seemingly irregular arrangements, the periodic arrangement of its internal radiation can still be seen. [1]. The crystal structure is often described in its symmetry. The crystal structure is limited, and only 32 symmetled points of symmetry, the crystal structure can be further classified, in which the spatial group of the hexalectine is mostly [2].\nThe crystal family can be defined by the length of the three crystal axes, the angle between the respective axes, the relationship, corresponding to its symmetry, and the downside is defined in symmetry. The following is a list of the transistors, A, B, and C are crystalline shaft length, \u03b1, \u03b2, gamma, and the angle angle adjacent to each axis, for example, \u03b1 is an angle of the b and Cd crystal axes: [2]:\n\n\n\nWhistle\n\nCrystal axis length\n\nAngle\n\nCommon example\n\n\nCube\n\nA = b = c\n\n\u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3 = 90 \u00b0\n\nGarnet, stone salt, yellow iron ore\n\n\nQuartet crystal system\n\nA = b \u2260 c\n\n\u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3 = 90 \u00b0\n\nGolden red, zircon, olivine\n\n\nOrthogonal\n\na \u2260 b \u2260 c\n\n\u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3 = 90 \u00b0\n\nOlivine, stone, slope\n\n\nSix-party crystal system\n\nA = b \u2260 c\n\n\u03b1 = \u03b2 = 90 \u00b0, \u03b3 = 120 \u00b0\n\nQuartz, Fangli Stone, Electrical Stone\n\n\nSingle allands\n\na \u2260 b \u2260 c\n\n\u03b1 = \u03b3 = 90 \u00b0, \u03b2 \u2260 90 \u00b0\n\nSingle rose, positive stone, gypsum\n\n\nThree-lascal\n\na \u2260 b \u2260 c\n\n\u03b1 \u2260 \u03b2 \u2260 \u03b3 \u03b3 90 \u00b0\n\nCalcium, sodium longstone, blue crystal\n\nCrystal conformation refers to the shape of the entire crystal. Common crystals such as sputum (English: accicular (crystal habit), blade shape, dendritic (like natural copper), equidine crystal (like natural copper), zeolite (English: natrolite)) Like olivine), the angle column and flat shape extending in one direction. And crystalline shapes, the quality of the crystal surface is also a way of confirming minerals, generally using a rock phase microscope to observe. The crystals of self-shaped (Euhedral and anhedral) have a clear shape, and the ANHEDORAL is not called half-shaped in the self-shaped crystal and his crystal [3] [4].\n\nHardness [edit]\nMain entry: Moh's hardness\n Diamonds are the most hard natural materials, Moh's hardness is 10\nThe hardness of the mineral is its ability to resist scraping. The hardness of minerals and the chemical composition of minerals and the crystal structure are related. The hardness of the mineral is a function of its structure, and the hardness in each direction is not necessarily a value, and some of the lattice weaknesses will make the hardness in one direction than the other direction. [5]. Like blue stones in parallel [001], the Moth hardness is 51/2, but in parallel [100], the Musk's hardness is 7 [6].\nThe most commonly used mineral hardness standard is a mineral, a mineral, a mineral, a mineral, a mineral, a mineral, a mineral, a mineral, a mineral, a mineral, a mineral, a mineral, a mineral, a mineral, a mineral, a mineral, a mineral, a mineral, a mineral, a mineral, a mineral, a mineral, a mineral, a mineral. The surface leaves a scratch. The Mournish hardness gauge refers to the ten minerals, the table is as follows [5]:\n\n\n\nhardness\n\nmineral\n\nAbsolute hardness\n\n\n1\n\nTalc (Mg3Si4o10 (OH) 2)\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\nGypsum (CASO4 \u00b7 2H2O)\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\nFangxite (CACO3)\n\n9\n\n\n4\n\nFluorite (CAF2)\n\ntwenty one\n\n\n5\n\nMatite (CA5 (PO4) 3 (OH-, CL-, F-))\n\n48\n\n\n6\n\nPositive stone (KALSI3O8)\n\n72\n\n\nSeduce\n\nQuyi (SiO2)\n\n100\n\n\n8\n\nHuang Yu (Al2SiO4 (OH-, F-) 2)\n\n200\n\n\n9\n\nCang Yu (Al2O3)\n\n400\n\n\n10\n\nDiamond (C)\n\n1500\n\nWhen the hardness is identified, if there is no more than the above Muosta hardness, other things can be used instead, such as the hardness of the small knife (or steel needle) is about 5.5, the copper coin is about 3.5 to 4, the nail is about 2 to 3, the glass hardness is 6 .\n\nGloss and transparency [edit]\n Caucasite has metallic gloss\nGloss refers to the ability of the mineral surface to light reflection and related to its mineral quality and intensity of light. There are many words describing mineral gloss, mainly divided into metal gloss and non-gold gloss. Metal gloss and high reflectivity of the secondary gloss, similar metals, like square lead ore and yellow iron ore have metal gloss. Non-metallic luster has Diamantine, such as diamonds, glass gloss (vitReous, such as silicate minerals), pearl luster (Pearly, such as talc and fisheet (English: apophyllite), resin gloss (RESinous, such as pomegranate Stone), silk gloss (Silky, fibrous minerals such as asbestos) [7].\nThe transparency of the mineral refers to the extent of its light transmissions. When light passes through transparent minerals, its strength will not decrease, such as white mica, some minerals or even transparent to the window. The translucent mineral allows part to pass, but the intensity is lower than by transparent minerals. Like jade and soft jade are translucent minerals. If the mineral is not allowed to pass through, it is called opaque [8] [9] [10].\n\nPower [edit]\nThe specific gravity is the ratio of mineral weight and the same volume of water, that is, minerals and 1ATM4 \u00b0 C pure water density ratio, no unit. For most of the minerals, it is not suitable for identifying minerals with specific gravity. The aravor mineral is mainly based on silicate and carbonate, and its density is between 2.5-3.5 [11].\nSome special minerals have a higher specific gravity. If the oxide and sulfide contain atomic mass, the proportion will be heavier, and the proportion of metal gloss or the rock of the golden gloss is more than non-metallic luster. The emphasis of gloss, such as the pre-proportion of FE2O3 of the hematite, and the proportion of PBS of the square lead ore is 7.2-7.6, and [13] is all iron and lead in which high atom quality is contained. The specific gravity of natural metal (English: native metal) is also quite high, such as cone stone is a ferrite alloy that often appears in the iron meteorite, the proportion of 7.9, [14], and the proportion of gold even between 15 and 19.3 [11] [15].\n\nBar marks [edit]\nMain entry: bar mark\nColors are one of the most obvious characteristics of minerals, but it is not easy to use colors to identify minerals [16].\nThe bar is the color left by the minerals, which is the color of the mineral powder. The color of the bar is not necessarily the same as the color of the mineral [9]. The way the test bar is friction on the mineral on the barboard, and the strip is generally china, the color is black or white, the color of the bar is not affected by the trace element of the mineral [8] or the surface of the mineral surface [9]. The color like the hematite may be black, silver or red, but the stripe color is cherry red [8] to red brown [9]. However, the stripe test has a certain limit on the hardness of the mineral, and if the hardness is greater than 7, the minerals and strips are rubbed, and the powder of the bar can be left in the mineral [9]. Other features [edit]\nFollow the method of mineral separation.\nBroken mouth: When the mineral is broken, the shape of the edge.\nRelated categories [edit]\nmining\nPotassium salt\nSodium salt\nBoron\nSalt mine\nPhosphate ore\nSee [edit]\nmineralogy\nMineral list\nMineral\nDietary mineral\nmetal\nenergy\nFootnotes [edit]\n\n\n^ DYAR AND GUNTER, PP. 2-4\n\n^ 2.0 2.1 DYAR AND GUNTER, PP. 69-80\n\n^ DYAR AND GUNTER, PP. 32-39\n\n^ Chesterman and Lowe, P. 38\n\n^ 5.0 5.1 Dyar and Gunter, PP. 28-29\n\n^ Kyanite.

It is a discipline system for studying the interaction between the surface of the Earth's surface, and the discipline system of its spatial differences and changes.\nGeographicists are traditionally be regarded as the same class with mapologists, and believe that both are famous and numbers. Although many geographicists have experienced the training of local names and maps, both are not their most concerned. Most geographicists have studied many phenomena, process, characteristics, and interrelationships in human and natural environments in space and time. Because the space and time affected a variety of topics such as economics, health, climate, plants and animals, geography is a highly interdisciplinary discipline.\nGeography as a discipline is mainly roughly divided into two areas: natural geography and human geography. Natural geography investigates the natural environment and how to cause terrain and climate, water, soil, vegetation, various phenomena of life and their relationship. Human geography focuses on how human beings are manufactured, treat and manage, and how human space is affected. Because the above is the reason, the third field of use of different methods is used in environmental geography. Environmental geography in the research results of natural geography and human geography, analyzes and commenting the relationship between human and nature, and proposes human conquest nature, transforming nature to adapt to its own sustainable development safety status and technology (including production technology and Conditions of System Technology.\n\ntable of Contents\n\n1 word source\n2 research category\n3 Introduction\n4 subject branch\n\n4.1 Natural Geography\n4.2 Human Geography\n4.3 Environmental Geography\n4.4 Geographical Information\n4.5 Regional Geography\n4.6 Related Categories\n4.7 Other Branch Disciplines\n\n\n5 geography technology\n\n5.1 map\n5.2 Geographic Information System\n5.3 telemetry\n5.4 Geographical Method\n5.5 geological method\n\n\n6 geography history\n\n6.1 \u5730 \u5730\n6.2 Round World Theory\n6.3 Jingwei line system and its evolution\n6.4 Geography, Leadership, Islamic World and China\n6.5 Geographical Discovery\n6.6 Establishment of Many Geography Associations\n6.7 Strengthening interdisciplinary connection\n\n\n7 parts have an influential geography\n8 reference\n9 See\n\n\nWord source [edit]\nThe word from Ancient Greek \u03b3\u03b5\u03c9\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 (Romanization: Geographia), is composed of Geo (meaning \"earth\") and graphein (meaning \"writing\"), which means \"a description of the land\". The earliest man using Geography is Eloranti, he uses this word to represent the study of the topic scenery.\nIn ancient China, the establishment of land or Justuctive, geographicity refers to the environmental situation of mountainous land [2]. After Japan, after the Meiji Destination, the word English Geography translated into translation as geography, and then passed into China.\nIn 1902, the Emperor Guangxu received Zhang Baixi, and promulgated the \"Qin Decoration\", in the formal school, there were two in history, and two. After Zhang Baixi, Wu Xiun went to Japan to study education, 1903, Zhang Baixi, Zhang Zhidong, who was responsible for education reform, and Rongqing recommended to redeem the school stages [3]. After re-redefining the charter, it is regulating the primary elementary school in Japan, and the history, the second sect, renamed history and geography. Then, geographic nouns are popular in China.\n\nResearch category [edit]\nTraditionally, geography has four basic research categories [4]:\n\nSpatial Analysis of Nature and Humanities, It refers to the study of distribution.\nArea Studies, which refers to the use of local and regional to interpret the characteristics of the earth.\nMan-Land Relationship Research, which means that various phenomena of nature on human beings, or the effects of human activities on nature.\nResearch on Earth Science.\nIn contrast, modern geography is a comprehensive coverage of the relevant discipline, and the geography circle has been scientific and dialectical, and the dialogue after the measuring revolution and the various philosophical ideas enters the school. The modern geography is to seek understanding space. In-depth complexity of human and nature - not only \"knowing it\", but to \"know it,\" Geography as \"Human Social Science and Natural Science Bridge\" is divided into two major branches - human geography and natural geography [5]. The earliest books in Ancient China include \"Yong Gong\" and \"Shan Hai Jing\". Ancient geography mainly explores the measurement methods related to the shape, size, or describes known areas and countries.\n\nIntroduction [edit]\nGeographicists are traditionally be regarded as the same class with the map, and believe that both are studying place names and numbers. Although many geographicists have experienced the training of local names and maps, both are not their focus. Geographicists have studied many phenomena, process, characteristics, and interrelationships of human and natural environments in space and time. [6] Because spatial and time affecting a variety of topics such as economy, health, climate, plants and animals, geography is a highly interdisciplinary discipline.\n\n\n\n\"\n\nJust just place name ... is not geography ... In your heart, remembering the topic name dictionary, does not make anyone a geographer. Geography has a farther goal: geography seeks to categorize phenomena (which is close to the natural world or politics world, and and and in today's latter), comparison is traced back to the reasons, The law of nature and its impact on human beings. She is a 'description of the world' - this is geography. In summary, geography is a science - one is more than just name but includes arguments and reasoning, reasons and results.\n\n\"\n\n\nWilliam Hughes 1863 [7]\n\nGeography as a discipline can be roughly divided into two larger areas: human geography and natural geography. The former focuses on how human beings build, how to treat, treat and manage and manage how to affect its occupied space. The latter investigates the natural environment and how to cause various phenomena of climate, vegetation, life, soil, water and terrain and their interrelationships [8]. Because the above is the reason, the third field of use of different methods is used in environmental geography. Environmental Geography Integration Humanities and Natural Geography and Observing the Interrelationship between Humans and Nature.

Its goal is to understand the rocky circles of nature, hydrological circles, large air circles, soil circles (Pedosphere) and biospheres (global plants and animal phase modes). Natural geography uses biology to study, is a systematic geography, understanding global flora and animal zone pattern, using mathematics, physics to study the exercise of the earth itself and its relationship with other solar system, is research Disciplines of global changes in position and space.

He contains the ingredients of social sciences such as humanities, politics and economic levels. Although the main focus of human geography is not the substantial landform of the earth (see natural geography), because various human activities occur in substantially land, it is actually not mentioning the substantial landform to discuss human geography and impossible. Environmental geography is just a bridge used as both.

Environmental geography has aware of human geography and natural geography, and also needs to have awareness of human society as a conceptualization environment.\nEnvironmental geography has become the increasing specialization of the above two disciplines as the bridges of human geography and natural geography. In addition, the relationship between human and environment has changed in globalization and technology development, and it is necessary to understand this relationship between this changing and dynamic. Examples of the research category of environmental geography have disaster management, Environmental Management, sustainability and ecological politics (ECOPOLITICS) or Political Ecology.\n\nGeographic Information [edit]\n Numerical elevation model (DIGITAL Elevation Model, DEM)\nMain entry: geographic information\nGeomatics is a branch of geography, which appears first in the 1950 Geographic Measurement Revolution (Quantitative Revolution). Geographic Information includes traditional spatial technology and computer applications that use local graphics and surveylation. Geographic Information is a universal subject with other disciplines using geographic information systems and remote sensing methods. Geographic Information also causes the revival of some geographic departments. This phenomenon especially in the 1950s experience in North America in North America.\nGeographic Information includes a wide range of disciplines including spatial analysis, such as maps, geographic information systems, remote sensing detection and global positioning systems.\n\nRegional geography [edit]\nMain entry: Regional geography\nRegional geography is a branch of geography, she studies the region of different sizes on the Earth. Its main purpose is to understand or define the uniqueness or characteristics of individual regions that contain human and natural factors. The attention of regional geography is also placed on Regionalization, including suitable methods to become a region.\nRegional geography is also considered to be an inevitable way to study geography (similar to metrics revolution or critical geography), detail the history of geography.\n\nRelated categories [edit]\nUrban planning, regional planning and spatial planning: Use geographical science help determine how to develop (or do not develop) land to meet specific conditions, such as safe, beautiful, economic opportunities, protect construction or natural heritage, etc. Wait. Urban, town and regional planning can be seen as application geography.\nRegionAl Science: Regional Science is taken by Walter Isard by Walter Isard, and she provides a more data and analysis of the basis for facing geographical problems, not traditional. Geography is facing the trend of description. The Space Dimension in the area of \u200b\u200bthe region plays an important role, such as regional economics, resource management, location theory, urban planning, regional planning, transportation, communications, human geography, population distribution Population distribution, landscape ecology and ambient quality.\nPlanetary: Although geography usually pays attention to the Earth, it is also possible to develop research in other worlds, such as other planets in the solar system, even farther. The study is usually partial astronomy or cosmology than the Earth's larger system. Research of other planets is often referred to as planetary.\nOther branch disciplines [edit]\nLocal name\nFang Zhixue\nTheoretical geography\nGeography technology [edit]\nSince the interrelationship of space is very important for geography of synoptic science, the map is a major tool. Geography Analysis In addition to using classic maps, it also fuses modern approach, namely computer-based geographic information systems (GIS).\nGeologists use four related methods in their study:\n\nSystematic - Combined geography knowledge has become different categories to fully explore.\nRegional - Different categories of systemic relationships at a particular area or location level.\nDescriptive (Descriptive) - Simple Determination of Overall and Features.\nAnalytical - Exploring the overall and characteristics of geographic regions in the location.\nMap School [edit]\n Cervier's World TO Map (1475).\nMain entry: map\nThe map studies the expression of the Earth's surface using symbols (ie, map production). Although other branch disciplines need to use maps to express their analysis, the actual map production theory is very enough to come from other disciplines. The map of the map is generated by drafting technology.\nCartography must learn cognitive psychology and people to understand the symbol to express the symbol to express the top of the earth, and learn behavior psychology can guide map readers to make action. They must learn to understand the earth and quite higher-order mathematics to understand the earth. How the shape affects the deformation of the map symbol, which is reflected in the plane. The map can be regarded as a seed of large disciplines in geography without disputeously. Most geographicists are fantastic to maps in young ages as an early characterization they will pursue their geography.\n\nGeographic Information System [edit]\n GVSIG Geographic Information System\nMain entry: geographic information system\nGeographic Information Systems, GIS process and stores high-accuracy Earth information in the computer. In addition to other geographical branches, geographic information system experts must understand computer science and database systems. The geographic information system causes a change in map of maps; almost all maps are now helped by geographic information system software. GIS also represents Geographic Information Science, which is the scientific relationship between software and technology using geographic information systems.\n\nTele-test [edit]\n US NASA is loaded on the side of a DC-8 plane of 'Airsar' synthetic aperture radar\nMain entry: telemetry\nRemote Sensing can be defined as a technology and science that achieves information from a distance. The information of telemetry comes from many aspects, including satellite maps, aviation photography, and portable sensors. Geographicists have increasing the Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Data that uses telemetry. The reason is:\n\nTelemetry can provide diverse space sizes (local to global)\nTelemetry can provide an outline view for the concerns area\nTelemetry can be allowed to arrive in remote and difficult locations\nTelemetry can provide spectral data outside the electromagnetic spectrum\nTelemetry can promote how to change for individual places due to time lapse\nThe data obtained by telemetry can analyze or analyze other digital data levels (eg, geographic information systems).\n\nGeographical method [edit]\nMain entry: geological statistics\nGeostatistics (Geostatistics) Processing the information derived from geographic quantity methods, especially the application of statistical methods to explore geographic phenomena. Geological statistics are widely used in many areas including: water literature, geology, petroleum exploration, weather analysis, urban planning, logistics and epidemiology. The mathematical foundation of geological statistics is from data clustering, distinct analysis, no mother-in-law and other people. The application of geological statistics in the geographic information system, especially in interpolation (estimates) of unsatisfactory points. Geographicists have significant participation in geographical techniques.\n\nGeopody method [edit]\n European major ethnic groups (1899)\nMain entry: Nationalism\nGeographic Qualitative Methods, or Ethnography research technology is used by human geography. Cultural geography has traditions with quality studies, and quality studies are also exploited by humanity and sociology. Human geography takes a participant observation and gaining quality data in depth.\n\nGeography history [edit]\n The world map of Anna Wansman is now guess [9]\nMain entry: Geography history\nGeography's text [edit]\nThe conception of Milles of Milu is a late Greek writer, believes that it is a geography of geography, and now only one of its successful sections can be known. Anakzand's contribution includes gnomon, although simple but she provides an effective greek tool as a measure of latitude. Thales and Anna Kendan were also praised because of the predictive yaw. The foundation of geography can be traced back to ancient culture, such as ancient, medieval and modern Chinese history. Initially explored geography in the art and scientific level, the map is used to learn from the map (see map history history of cartography), ancient Greek philosophy, ancient Greek literature or mathematics (see Math History of Mathematics), etc. Geography.\n\nRound World Theory [edit]\nThe first person who pointed out that the Earth is the sphere is the dispute between Badenid or Pythagoras. Alikaro La Lei can use the interpretation of the eclipse theory to show that the earth is circular, but he thinks the earth is flat as the other contemporary scholars. Eltostny is one of the people who originally estimated Earth radius [10].\n\nJingwei line system and evolution [edit]\n The 15th-century printing Ptale Map shows the latitude and latitude system\nThe first initial exact latitude and longitudinal system is considered to be Xipcha. He uses Babylon Mathematics to perform a Sixty Get Affirmation System. Wire and weft are subdivided to 360 \u00b0, each degree is more subdivided into 60 '(angle). For measurement (the longitude of different positions, he proposed to use the daily etch to determine the difference between the relative time [11]. The Roman Empire Explore the extensive mapping in the new place to provide a highly information to Toller's construct a detailed image ( Atlas). The results of Ptle Tervance Yanpatas, using coordinate network (Grid System) and 56.5 miles on the map [12].\n\nGeography, Islamic World and China [Editor]\nThe Empire of the Roman Empire is transferred from Europe to Islamic World by Europe. [13]. Scholars include Abu Abd Allah Muhammad Al-Idrisi, Ibbd Allah Muhammad Al-Idrisi, Iben Batuhammad Al-Idrisi, and Iben Herle Tower. In addition, Islamic scholars translate and interpret the early works of the ancient Rome and ancient Greece, and build wisdom (House of Wisdom) as the above use in Baghdad [14]. In the third century, geography research methods and geographical literature writing in Chinese history and geographical literature were more complicated in Europe [13]. Chinese geography, such as Liu An, Shen Kui, Fan Cheng, Zhou Daguan, Xu Xiake, etc. Writing a lot of important indices, but after the 17th century, there are many geographical concepts and methods of Western geography by China.\n\nGeographical discovery [edit]\nMain entry: geographical discovery\nDuring the 16th to 17th century, the explorers were discovered and occupied by Christopher Columbus and other new land, which requested geographical materials more accurate, and a more robust theoretical basis. Geographia Generalis, which is \"Geographia Generalis\", is the first class of new scientific geography, from Gerardus Mercator and Bernhardus Varenius. example.\n\n Self-portrait of the Geography Pioneer Alexander Von Humboldt\nThe establishment of many geography associations [edit]\nGeography is identified as an independent academic subject in the 18th and 19th century and has become a classic course in Europe (especially Paris and Berlin). During the 19th century, many geography associations were developed, including the Royal Geographic Society, which was established in 1821 (Royal Geographical Society) [16], Russian Geographic Association established in 1845. [17], 1851 American Geographic Society [18], National Geographic Association, which was established in 1888 [19]. The impact of Emanuel Kant, Alexandria von Humboldt, Carl Lee, and Vidal de la Blache can be regarded as a geographical transition from philosophy to a transformation point.\n\nEnhancement of interdisciplinary connection [edit]\nIn the past two centuries, technological progress such as computers, such as computers, etc., the development of geographic information, such as participating in observation and geological statistics as geographic research. In the 20th century, the Geographic Academic experienced four processes: environmental decisions, regional geography, measurement revolution and critical geography. Because Earth science pursues the relationship between the world with a full coverage, interdisciplinary connection is largely strengthened in geography, geology, economics, sociology, and population statistics.\n\nSome influential geography [edit]\n \"Geography\" painted by Jan Formor\nMain entry: List of geography\nEltisti (\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c3 \u03b8 \u03bd\u03b7\u03c2, first 276 - 194 years): The main contribution is to design a latitude and longitude system and calculate the size of the earth.\nCrawius Tori (\u03bb \u03cd \u03cd \u03cd\u03cd\u03cd\u1fd6 \u03c0\u03c4 \u03bb\u03bb\u03bb\u03bc\u1fd6\u1fd6\u03c2, about 90 years - 168): Compile Greece and Rome's knowledge and has become a \"Geody Guide\".\nGeradus Mercator, 1512 - 1594): Innovative mapologist contributing to the inventive McCato projection method.\nAlexander Von Humbon (Alexander Von Humboldt, 1769 - 1859): It is regarded as one of the parents of modern geography, and publishes the \"universe\" and the branch of geography.\nCarl Ritter (Carl Ritter, 1779 - 1859): It is regarded as one of the parents of modern geography.

The mathematics is produced by the use of abstraction and logic reasoning, and is produced by counting, calculation, measurement, and observation of object shape and motion. Mathematics expand these concepts, in order to formulate new conjectures and build a rigorous derivation of a rigorous propagation from selected axioms and definitions. [5]\nThe knowledge and application of basic mathematics is an indispensable ring in individuals and group life. The improvement of the basic concepts of mathematics, early ancient mathematics text in ancient Egypt, Mesopoamia and ancient Indies, and there is a more rigorous treatment in ancient Greece. Since then, the development of mathematics continues to make a small progress, until the Renaissance of the 16th century, because the interaction of new scientific discovery and mathematical innovation, causing accelerated development until today. [6] Mathematics and become part of the education category of many countries and regions.\nToday, mathematics use in different areas, including science, engineering, medicine, economics and financial schools. The application of mathematics is often referred to as application mathematics, and sometimes it will also arouse new mathematical discovery, leading to the development of new disciplines, such as some of the theoretical stimulating mathematicians established in physics's substantive development. Mathematics for some Thoughts on the Different Angles of Problems. Mathematics also studies pure mathematics, which is the substantive content of mathematics itself without any practical application. Many studies have started with pure mathematics, but many applications have also been found in the process.

[8] [9]\nThe word \"mathematics\" expressed by Chinese characters is approximately in the Song Dynasty in China.

Until 1939, after the Chinese Mathematical Nouns Review Committee studied the use of \"Algorology\" and \"Mathematics\", it was confirmed that \"Mathematics\" expressed the math meaning in today's sense today. [10]\n\nHistory [edit]\nMain entry: Mathematics history\n Qipu, the counting tool used when I am Inca.\n Mayan numbers\nMathematics has a long time history. It is considered to originate from early production activities: one of the six art in ancient China, \"number\" [11], mathematics word in the West has greek phrase \u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03c4\u03ba ((Mathematik\u00f3s), meaning \"The foundation of learning\", source \u039c \u03b8\u03b7 \u03bc\u03b1 (m\u00e1thema, \"science, knowledge, learning\").\nPrehumans have tried to measure the quantity of the substance, the length of time, such as the time unit, season and year, etc. Math (addition and subtraction) also has naturally occurred. The ancient stone monument and mud plate also confirmed the knowledge of the already geometric time [12].\nFurther, writing or other recordable systems, such as monuments, or odds used to store data in the Empire. There have been many different counting systems in history [13].\nAt the initial historical record, the main principle within mathematics is to do relation for tax and trade, in order to understand the relationship between the digital, in order to measure the land, and to predict the astronomical events. These needs can be simply summarized as mathematical research on quantities, structures, space and time.\nIn the 16th century, the initial mathematics of the arithmetic, primary algebra, and the triangular school has been generally complete [14] [15]. The production of variable concepts in the 17th century makes people begin to study the mutual relationship between the amount and the amount of the amount and the mutual transformation between the graphics, and the concept of calculus is also formed at this time. With the formation of mathematical steering, the aggregation and progeny logic of the study of mathematics is also begun. The focus of mathematics from solving practical problems to the general form.\nFrom ancient times, mathematics has been continuously extended, and there is a rich interaction with science, and the development of the two benefits to each other. There are many mathematical discovery in history, and it is constantly new discovery today. According to MIKHAIL B. Sevryuk, the January 2006 in January 2006 said, \"Store the quantity of the paper and books in the mathematical review database since 1940 (mathematics comments) The year of the publication) has now exceeded 190,000 copies, and it has increased more than 750,000 copies each year. The most of this school sea is a new mathematical theorem and its proof. \"[16]\nThe Maasa number next to it is a black point represents a black line representing five\n\nFormation, Pure Mathematics and Applied Mathematics and Aesthetics [Edit]\n Newton (1643-1727), one of the inventors of the calculus.\nMain entry: Mathematics beauty\nWhenever there is a difficult problem involving quantity, structural, space and variation, a mathematical tool is usually required to solve the problem, and this often expands the research category of mathematics. At the beginning, the use of mathematics can be found in trade, land measurement and subsequent astronomy. Today, all sciences have problems worthy of mathematicians, and mathematics it also gives a lot of problems. Newton and Leibniz are the inventors of calculus, Ferman invent Fayman path points, which is the product of the two of the foreigners and physics, and today's string theory also demonstrates new mathematics. Some mathers are only related to the fields that generate it, and more of this area is used to answer more questions. However, it is generally useful to be very useful in many other fields, and can be a general mathematical concept. Even \"the most pure\" mathematics usually also has practical use, this is a non-ordinary fact that 1963 Nobel Physical Award winner Vigna said \"Mathematics in natural science is not imagined in natural science\" [17] .\nAs in most research areas, scientific knowledge broke out the specialization of mathematics. The main differences are pure mathematics and application mathematics. In the application mathematics, it is divided into two major areas and has become their own discipline - statistics and computer science.\nMany mathers are talking about the beauty of mathematics, their inner aesthetics and beauty. \"Simple\" and \"Generalization\" are one of them. In addition, ingenious proven, such as proof of unlimited multi-prime numbers; or speeding the calculated numerical method, such as fast Fourier transform. Gao Defi Harold Hadi is in the book of \"a mathematician's self-contained\". He believes that it is a single aesthetic meaning, which is enough as a legitimate reason for pure math research.\n\nSymbol, language and accuracy [edit]\nMain entry: mathematical symbol\n In modern symbols, simple representations may depict complex concepts. This image is generated from X = Cos (Y Arccos Sin\u3021x\u3021 + X Arcsin Cos\u3021y\u3021)\nMost of the mathematical symbols we used today were invented after the 16th century. [18] Before this, mathematics is written in the form of text, which limits the development of mathematics. Today's symbols make mathematics easier to master for experts, but beginners often look at this. It is extremely compressed: a small amount of symbols contain a lot of messages. As music symbols, today's mathematical symbols have clear grammar, and effectively encode information, this is difficult to do other writing methods. Symbolization and formation makes mathematics rapidly and helps establish basic support theories in various science.\nMathematics languages \u200b\u200bhave also difficult to speak for beginners. Such as \"or\" and \"only\" have more precise meanings than the daily term. It is also annoying that beginners, such as \"open\" and \"domain\" and other words have special meaning in mathematics. Mathematical terms also include special nouns such as \"same embryo\" and \"conjunctionability\". However, the use of these special symbols and proprietary terms is why: mathematics requires more accuracy than daily terms. Mathematics refer to this requirement of language and logic accuracy as \"rigorous\". But in real-world applications, some stringency will often get better results.\nStrict is a very important part of mathematics proven. Mathematics hopes that their theorem is inference in a systematic reasoning. This is to avoid the incorrect \"ore \"in order to be unreliable, and this situation has experienced many examples in history. [19] The rigorous level of math is different from time to time: the Greeks will be careful, but in Newton's era, the method used is not rigorous. Newton's definitions made to solve the problem, re-dealt with careful analysis and formal proof by the 19th century. Today, mathematicians continue to argue the rigidity of computers. When a large number of calculations are difficult to verify, it is difficult to say that it is so strict.\nThe axiom in traditional thinking is \"Do not know the truth\", but this idea is problematic. In form, the axiom is only a string of symbols, which is only meaningful for the contents of formulas that can be derived from the axiom system. The Hilbert plans to put all the mathematics on a strong axiom, but according to the Naddel's incomplete theorem, each compatible and inclusive formula will contain a unresolved formula; Thus all mathematical final systemification is impossible. Despite this, mathematics often imagine a collection of a axioming, in which meaning, all mathematical descriptions or proof can write a collection of formulas.\n\nMathematics as science [edit]\n Carl Friedrich Gaussian\nCarl Friedrich Gauss said the mathematics as \"scientific queen\". [20] In Latin Original Regina Scientiarum, and its German K\u00f6nigin Der Wissenschaften, the meaning of \"science\" is all knowledge (field). In fact, the word Science in English is the meaning in English, and there is no doubt that mathematics is indeed a \"science\" in this sense. Limiting scientific limits in nature science is after this. If science is to refer to the physical world, mathematics, or at least pure mathematics will not be a science. Einstein has been so described: \"The more relevant mathematics Law and reality, the more uncertainty; if they are determined, they will never be related to the reality.\" [21]\nMany philosophers believe that mathematics does not have no negative negative [22], and therefore is not the science defined by Carl Popme. However, in the 1930s, in the logic of mathematics, the mathematics cannot be returned to logic, and Popul is inferred \"Mathematical law, such as physics and biology, it is assumptions: pure mathematics has become Close closer to its assumptions, natural sciences, which seems to be more close than it now. \"[23] However, other thinkers, such as more famous Lakatos, provided a delegation of mathematics itself.\nAnother point of view is that certain scientific areas (such as theoretical physics) are just mathematics to try to meet realistic mathematics. In fact, John Ziman, is considered to be science is a public knowledge and therefore also contains mathematics. In any case, many areas of mathematics and physical science have many identical places, especially from the hypothesis of the logic preview. Intuition and experiments play an important role in mathematics and scientific conjecture. The importance of experimental mathematics is continuously increasing, and the roles of calculation and simulation in science and mathematics are increasingly aggravating, alleviating the shortcomings of mathematics do not use scientific methods. In Stephen Volfham's work in 2002, he proposed that computational mathematics should be seen as its own scientific field to explore.\nMathematics is inconsistent with this attitude. Some studies in studying the application of mathematics think they are scientists, and those mathematicians who study pure mathematics often feel that they work in a near logic, and therefore basically a philosophers. Many mathematicians believe that their work is a science, which is an importance of its aesthetics, as well as the history of one of the seven major Boya; It is also believed that if it is ignored, it is ignored that the relationship between its science is Pretending to see math and its interaction between science and engineering, in turn to promote this fact in many scientific development. The difference between the two views has created mathematics in philosophy and \"created\" (such as art) or \"discovered\" (such as science). The University Department is divided into the \"Science and Mathematics Department\", which is pointed out that the two areas are seen as close contact rather than the same. In fact, mathematicians usually work generally to scientists, but they will be separated in detail. This dispute is one of the many topics of mathematics philosophy.\n\nMathematics's various fields [edit]\nSee: Mathematics\n Early mathematics completely focused on the actual calculation of the calculation, as reflected in the Chinese abacus.\nAs mentioned above, the primary disciplines of mathematics are first generated in the needs of commercially calculated, understanding the relationship between digital, measuring land and predictive astronomical events. These four need to be related to quantities, structural, space and variations (ie, arithmetic, algebra, geometric and analysis). In addition to the above major attention, there is also use to explore subsequent domains from mathematical cores to other fields: to logic, to agreed (foundation), mathematics (application mathematics) of different scientific experiences (application mathematics), And stringent studies of more than modern to uncertainty.\n\nFoundation and philosophy [edit]\nIn order to clarify the fields of mathematics, mathematical logic and collection theory.\nMathematics logic focuses on the results of this architecture in a rugged aquary structure. As far as the mathematics logic itself, it is the area where the second incomplete theorem of Gotel is, which may be the most widely circulated results in logic: there is always a true life that cannot be certified.\nModern logic is divided into conclusion, model theory and proven, and the theoretical computer science has a close relationship, and the P / NP problem in the Millennium Grand Prize is the famous issue in theoretical computer science [24].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP\n\u21d2\nQi\n\n\n\n{\\ DisplayStyle P \\ RightArrow Q \\,}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMathematical logic\nAggregate\nCategory\n\nPure mathematics [edit]\nQuantity [edit]\nThe number of studies started from the number, and at the beginning, the number of natural numbers and integers and arithmetic operations described in arithmetic numbers and integers were described. The integer has a deeper nature in detailed research in the origin, including the famous results such as the final theorem, such as the Fatim. The paper also included two unsolution issues that were widely explored: the number of twins and the guess of Gothbach [25].\nWhen the number is further developed, an integer is considered a subset of rational numbers, and the rational number is included in the real number, that is, the continuous amount is represented by a real number. Real numbers can be further widely understood. Further broadness of numbers can last until the number of quad numbers and eight metals. From the number of natural numbers, it can also be extended to overrun, which forms the concept of counting to unlimited. Another area of \u200b\u200bresearch is the size, which leads to the base and the other concept of unlimited: Alen, which allows the size between unlimited collections to make sense.

The structural properties of these objects are discussed in abstract systems such as groups, rings, and domains, in fact, such a system. This is the field of algebra. There is a very important concept, which is a vector space in vector space, which is studied in linear algebra. Vector research combines three basic fields of mathematics: quantity, structure and space. Vector analysis expands them to the fourth basic field, ie changes.\nThe Burbaki School founded in the 1930s believes that pure mathematics is the theory of studying abstract structures.\nThe structure is the interpretation system starting with initial concepts and the axioms.\nThe Burbak School believes that there are three basic abstract structures: algebraic structures (group, ring, domain ...), order structure (predepending order, full order ...), topology (neighborhood, limit, connectivity, dimension) ...) [26].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber Theory\nGroup theory\nGraph Theory\nSequence theory\n\nSpace [edit]\nSpace research stems from geometry - especially Eucli Geometry. The triangular school combines space and number and includes a famous ticking theorem. Today's research is more promoted to the geometry of more high-dimensional, non-Europoliology (which plays a core role in general relativeism) and topology. Number and space have a very important role in parsing geometry, differential geometry and algebraic geometry. There is a concept such as a fiber plexus and a gang shape in a differential geometry. In algebraic geometry, there is a description of geometric objects such as polynomial equations, combined with the concept of numbers and spaces; there is also a research on topology group, combining structural and space. Li Qun is used to study space, structure and change. In many branches, topology may be the most important field in the 20th century mathematics, and include there is a long-standing Pangola guess, as well as controversial four-color theorem. Pangola I want to confirm in 2006 by Russian mathematician Grigo Perelman [27], and the four-color theorem has been used in 1976 by Kane Apel and Woffgang Hamken. Computer proves [28], and has never been verified by manpower.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeometry\nTriangle\nDifferential Geometry\nTopology\nFragmentation\nMeasurement\n\nChange [edit]\nUnderstanding and description changes in natural sciences is a general topic, while the calculus is more popular with changes in the changes. The function is born, as a core concept of describing a change. For the strict research of real and real-transformation functions, the complex analysis is the equivalent area of \u200b\u200bthe plural. Liman Guess - One of the most basic unrequisites in mathematics - it is to be described by repeated analysis [29]. Functional analysis focuses on the (generally unlimited) space in the function. One of the many applications of functional analysis is quantum mechanics. Many problems naturally export a relationship between an amount and its change rate, which is studied in differential equations. Many phenomena in nature can be described by the power system; chaos theory is a clear description of the system's neither predictable and decisive behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncalculus\nVector analysis\nDifferential equation\npower system\nChaos theory\nRe-analysis\n\nDiscrete mathematics [edit]\nDiscrete mathematics refers to the general name of mathematics in the most useful mathematics of theoretical computer science, which contains calculated theory, calculating complexity theory and information theory. The limits of different theoretical models of the same theoretical test computer can be calculated, which contains the most powerful models - Triumplate [30]. Complexity Theory Studies can be made by computers to be more easy to handle; some problems can be solved by computer, but because they will spend too much time or space, it is still not actually possible, although Quick progress in computer hardware. Finally, the theory of information is focused on the total amount of information that can be stored within a particular medium, and therefore there is a concept of compression and entropy.\nAs a relatively new area, discrete mathematics has many basic unhyth questions. One of the most famous for P / NP - one of the millennium prizes. [31] Generally I believe that the answer to this problem is negative.\n[32]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n)\n\n\n(\n1\n,\n3\n,\n2\n)\n\n\n\n\n(\n2\n,\n1\n,\n3\n)\n\n\n(\n2\n,\n3\n,\n1\n)\n\n\n\n\n(\n3\n,\n1\n,\n2\n)\n\n\n(\n3\n,\n2\n,\n1\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\ DisplayStyle {\\ Begin {Matrix} (1, 2, 3) & (1, 3, 2) \\\\ (2, 1, 3) & (2, 3, 1) \\\\ (3, 1, 2) & (3, 2, 1) \\ end {matrix}}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombinatorial Mathematics\nCalculation theory\nCryptography\nGraph Theory\n\nApplication mathematics [edit]\nApplying mathematical thinking to use abstract mathematical tools in answering the reality of science, industry and commerce, and other fields. An important area in the application of mathematics is statistically, which utilizes the opportunity to describe the tools and allow for a phenomenon containing opportunity ingredients. Most of the experiments, investigations and observations require statistical analysis of their information. (Many statistically do not think they are mathematicians, and more than one part of the cooperative group.) Numerical analysis studies have any calculation methods, which can effectively solve mathematical problems that are calculated by those who have limited humans; it It also contains the study of errors of rounding errors or other sources in the calculation [33].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMathematical physics\n\n\n\n\n\nMathematical fluidism\n\n\n\n\n\nNumerical Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\noptimize\n\n\n\n\n\nProbability\n\n\n\n\n\nstatistics\n\n\n\n\n\nMetering finance\n\n\n\n\n\ngame theory\n\n\n\n\n\nMathematical economics\n\n\n\n\n\nBiological mathematics\n\n\n\n\n\nJob study\n\n\n\n\n\nControlism\n\n\n\n\nMathematics award [edit]\n Filz medals positive\nMathematics Awards are usually separated from other scientific awards. The most famous award in mathematics is the Filz award, [34] [35] was founded in 1936 and awarded once every four years. It is usually considered to be a Nobel Prize in the Mathematics. Another international major award is the Abeel, founded in 2003. Both awards at specific work themes, including the innovation of the new field of mathematics or no solutions in the mature field. The 23 issues called Hilbert were proposed in 1900 by German mathematician David Hilbert in 1900. This series of problems have a very high sense between mathematicians, and at least nine questions have been answered. Another new seven important issues, called the millennium prize, published in 2000. There are one million dollars in the solution for each question, while there is only one problem (Liman guess) and the problem of Hilbert repetition.\n\nThe Filz Prize, awarded award from the International Mathematician Congress of the International Mathematics Alliance. Awards once every four years, awarded a young mathematician with excellent contribution, each time a prize. The winners must be forty years old before the New Year's Day, which is the biggest award you can get in young mathematicians [36]. It is established according to the requirements of John Charles Filz, Canada. The Filz Award is seen as the Nobel Prize in the Mathematics.\nThe Wolf Award was issued by the Wolf Foundation, found in Israel in 1976, began awards in 1978 [37]. Founder Ricardo Wolf is diplomatic home, industrial and charity. The Wolf Mathematics Award is a award from the Wolf Award, which is also known as the highest honor of mathematicians and the Philz.\nThe Abel Prize is awarded a award from the Norwegian royal family to the outstanding mathematicians. In 2001, in order to commemorate the 2002 Norwegian mathematician Nilles Henry Abel, the Norwegian government announced that it will begin to issue this bonus [38]. The amount of the bonus is roughly similar to the Nobel Prize. One reason for setting up this award is also because Nobel Prize has no mathematics award. In 2001, the Norwegian government allocated 200 million Norwegian Krand as a startup fund. Expand the impact of mathematics, attracting young people engaged in mathematics research is the main purpose of establishing the Abel Prize.\nSee [edit]\n\n\nMathematical theme\nMathematics philosophy\nMath game\nMathematician list\neducation\nBe considered ten books\nMathematical Competition\nMath question\nNote [edit]\n\n\n^ 1.0 1.1 Mathematics, N ..

[4] Since material and energy are basic elements involved in all scientific research, physics is one of the most basic disciplines in nature sciences. Physics is an experimental science, physical scholars from observation and analysis of nature-based phenomena based on material and energy. These patterns are called \"physical theory\", which can result in the common physical theory of experimental tests called physical law until one day proves to have errors (negative negative). Physics is made up of these laws. Physics is one of the most basic disciplines in nature science. Theory of chemistry, biology, archaeological and other sciences is the construction of these physical laws. [5]: 1-2 [6]: 2-3\nPhysics is one of the oldest academics. [6]: 2 physics, chemistry, biology, etc. Originally attributed to the scope of natural philosophy, until the seventeenth century to the 19th century, gradually grow from the independent academic field from natural philosophy. [7]: 193-194 Physics has considerable intersection with many other cross-domain research, such as quantum chemistry, biophysics, and more. The physical border boundary of physics is not fixed. The founding breakthrough in physics can often be used to explain the basic mechanism of these cross-regional research, and sometimes open a new cross-section research. [5]: 1-2\nThrough the creation of new theories and development new technology, physics has extremely significant contributions to human civilization. For example, due to electromagnetic rapid development, new products such as electric lights, electric machines, household appliances have emerged, and the living standards of human society have also been greatly improved. [5]: 1 [8] Because the nuclear physics is getting mature, nuclear power generation is no longer a blueprint concept, but the security issues that have caused people to realize the earth environment, ecological and humans.\n\ntable of Contents\n\n1 history\n\n1.1 Ancient Greek Physics\n1.2 Medieval Middle Ages\n1.3 classic physics\n1.4 Modern Physics\n\n\n2 core theory\n\n2.1 classic physics\n2.2 Modern physics\n2.3 Differences between classic physics and modern physics\n\n\n3 relationships between and other academic fields\n\n3.1 Physics complementary\n3.2 Application and Influence\n\n\n4 academic research\n\n4.1 Scientific Method\n4.2 Theory and Experiment\n4.3 Category and goals\n4.4 Research\n\n4.4.1 Particle Physics\n4.4.2 Atomic molecules and photophysics\n4.4.3 Condensed Physics\n4.4.4 Astronomical Physics\n\n\n\n\n5 recent research\n6 See\n7 note\n8 reference\n9 external connection\n\n\nHistory [edit]\nMain entry: Physics history\nThe word \"physics\" is \"Physics\" in English, and it is the first to come to the ancient Greek \"\u03cd\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2\", the original meaning is \"nature\". In Chinese, \"Physics\" can be found in the Warring States Period, \"\u9e56 \u9e56 \u00b7 \u9207 \u9207 \u9207\" \"I hope to know how to physically physically, I will find\" physical \",\" Physics \" It is all the truth of everything. [9] The three countries, Yang Quan has \"physics\", the earliest title contains \"physics\" one word. [10] The scientists in the late Qing Dynasty were influenced by the West, and the encyclopedia book \"Physical Experience\" was written here. Here, the meaning of \"physics\" has evolved into academic, including natural sciences. Some fields of humanities. [11] [12]\nAfter the Qing Dynasty Opium War, Western science was introduced to China. At this time, the translator translated \"Physics\" as \"Gechi\" or \"Geology\". \"The word\" is known \"is derived from\" Book. University \":\" \"I know in the form, the given is known\", say, \"If you want to enhance knowledge, you must be careful, only the reason of the matter, you can enhance knowledge.\" This sentence is pointed out that things are the key ways to enhance knowledge. In physics, you will usage, simulation, experiments, presentations, interpretation, and other methods. Therefore, \"Physics\" translate \"Physics\" or \"Geology\" seems to be reasonable. [13]: 2-3\nChinese Warring States philosophers famous Hui Shi, Deng (DANG and Gong Sun Long, and ink home, have worked hard to study all the composition of the universe. Hui Shi has ten propositions, mainly analyzed for nature, some of which contain dialectical elements. He said: \"The big one is not outside, it is a big one; to a small incomplete, it is a small one.\" \"Big\" means that the whole space is big enough, no longer have external; \"small one\" refers to the unit that is the minimum substance, and it is not segmented, no longer there; [14]. The famous ideological contract is dedicated to the representative, and believes that \"Tian and the Geoteles, Mountain and Zip Ping\", all things \"all\" is \"diplomatic\", there is no difference [14]. The post-ink family believes that the material world is composed of micro-non-divided material particles [14].\n\nAncient Greek physics [edit]\n In 1824, a depression in the Machinery Magazine issued in London. Akimid said: \"Give me a fulcrum, I can pick up the whole earth.\" [15]: 65-66\nSince ancient times, people have tried to understand the mystery of nature: Why do things fall into the ground? Why does different substances have different natures? So wait. From the phenomenon of observation and analysis, early people found the style and put forward various theories for these styles, trying to explain the mystery of nature, but most theories they have are not correct. From a modern criterion, the early physical theory is more like some philosophy theory: modern theory needs to have a strict experimental test, and those early theories have not been strictly confirmed. Among the theory of Tobegm and Aristotle, some are contrary to the facts that the daily observed. [16]: 1, 28\nDespite this, there are still many ancientists contribute a quite correct theory. Ancient Greek philosopher Tayles (previous 624 - 546 years) once traveled into the Mediterranean, in Mesopoamia Egypt, studying astronomy and geometry, and promoted extended, and promoted. He predicts the yaw of the 585 BC, and it is also possible to estimate the distance from the shore, and the height from the shadow of the pyramid. Tayles refused to rely on nick or supernatural factors to explain natural phenomena. He advocates that any incident has its constant causal causal relationship. [15]: 8-10, 28 [17] The ancient Greek philosopher, the first 5th century BC, led the first to the primary discussion, and believe that all substances consist of not destroyed and indivisible atoms. . [15]: Ancient Greek's thinker Akimid derived a number of correct quantitative conclusions in terms of role, such as explanation of leverage [15]: 65-66.\n\nMedieval in the Middle Ages [edit]\nFrom the Xiyuan 850 to 950, a large number of Greek academics were translated into Arabic. Muslim scientists inherited Aristotle physics from the Greek. In the Islamic Golden Age, they will carry forward these academics, especially emphasize observations, and develop an early form of scientific methods. [15]: 130-131. [18]: 362-363\n\n Heshu is an optical pioneer\nIben Schal (English: IBN SAHL), KFI, Heishu, Iben Westa gives innovative theory in optical and visual fields. Heshum is firmly refuted by the famous book \"Kitab Al-Optics\" (Kitab Al-Optics \"(Kitab Al-Optics\" (Kitab Al-Optics \"(Kitab Al-Optics\", firmly refute ancient Greek visual theory - launching and giving new theory. Relying on the information on the internal anatomy of the eye, he explained how the light enters the eyes, how to focus and projection to the back of the eye, he thinks the eyes are like \"dark room\", after the light enters a small hole, form an upside down image in the dark room . Obviously, here, he refers to a pinhole camera or a dark box. He also describes how to use darkroom to observe the eclipse. [19]: 6-7\nThe achievements of Heshuma in the Arab world have not received their attention. In the twenth century, his work was translated into Latin, and the book was named \"perspectiva). Until the seventeenth century, this work in Europe is an optical standard reference book, which strongly affects the study of Johannes Cipher, Wittro, Roger Peter and other scientists. [19]: 6-7 [20]: 86, 209\n\nClassic physics [edit]\n Aisak Newton (1643 - 1727)\nClassical physics refers to physics that does not involve quantum mechanics or relativism, such as Newtonian, thermodynamics, Mark Wewei electromagnetics, and more. [21] The period of the classic physics begins in the sixteenth century, the first scientific revolution, and terminates in the end of the 19th century. [22]: 67 [23]: 11 Nikola Coperniced the first shot of the scientific revolution, and he put forward the date of describing the sun system in 1543, this theory overthrew the role of Toller. During 1609 and 1619, Johannes Kelch was published the law of the leading planet, and he used the mathematical equation to accurately estimate the planetary discovery from astronomical observations around the public transfer data from the sun, thus giving the heart to say strong and powerful. Theoretical support. Galileo Galilele made an experimental study of object motion, discovered the law of the law, and showed the importance of experimental methods for scientific research. He relies on the use of experiments or observations, rather than relying on pure reasoning, to confirm any of the correctness of the hypothesis. He emphasized the use of mathematics to describe physical phenomena, and the language of nature is mathematics. If you don't understand mathematics, you can't understand nature. In 1687, the Law of Newton, Bouton and the law of gravitation laid a solid foundation for classic physics. He and Gottfried Leibniz created a solution, giving a new high-functional mathematics. Methods to analyze physical problems. He made a perfect terminator for the first scientific revolution. [24] [22]: 84, 98 Physics showed two single features: using experimental evidence to view physical law, using mathematical language to express physical law. The gradual development of physics has become an independent discipline. [22]: 100 [7]: 193-194\n\nModern physics [edit]\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, physicians found that there was a very serious flaw in classic physics: the zero results of Mike - Mo Li experiments did not meet the prediction of classic physics. The black-body radiation spectrum did not meet the thermodynamic prediction. Classic electromagnetically unable to explain photoelectric electricity. The effects and atomic spectroscopy, the physical properties of radioactive materials are similar to the decision of classical physics. These \u75b5 brought an unprecedented test to the academic community, completely shake the cornerstone of the old theoretical system, led to the relationship between the two major theoretical systems of the 20th century and the emergence of quantum mechanics, and began the era of modern physics. Relativity and Quantum Mechanics give a reasonable solution to these puzzles. Not only that, physical scholars apply relativism and quantum mechanics to micro-systems like atoms, molecules, etc., and various coagulatory macro systems, thus deepening the working mechanism of nature, and promoting the flourishing of material civilization. [25]: 1-2\n\nCore Theory [edit]\nAlthough physics has a wide range of studies, physicians often use the core theory of certain physics. These theories have passed many inspections of different experiments, and the prediction of natural phenomena is considered enough accurate, for example, classic mechanics theory can accurately describe the movement of objects, but must meet two premises, one is the size of the object is large At the atom, the second is that the object motion speed is too small and the light speed. [26]: 2 Today, these core theories are still very popular in research. For example, after the second half of the twentieth century, after three centuries of Buffton (1642 - 1727), scholars found and creating chaos theories, revealing the predictability of the mechanics system, is a mistake Concept. [27]\nThese core theories are generally included in the field of classic mechanics, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, electromagnetic, narrow relativism, etc., is an important tool for advanced research topics. [28]\n\nClassic physics [edit]\nMain entry: classic physics\nClassic physics includes traditional academic branches in the early 20th century: classic mechanics, acoustic, optical, thermodynamics, electromagnetic, and more. [twenty one]\nClassic mechanics study the motion of the object. Newton's law is the basic law of classical mechanics. Classic mechanics is divided into static, kinematics and kinetics. Static discussion is in the static balanced object feels the force and torque. Kinematics describes the movement of the object, completely regardless of force or quality, etc. affecting the factors. Dynamics study changes the factors of object motion and object motion thus change. Different in the manner, classic mechanics can be divided into vector mechanics and analytical mechanics. Vector mechanics focuses on the relationship between displacement, speed, acceleration, force, etc., and analytical mechanics analyzes the motion behavior of the object from the Ragrang's daily or Hami at the time of the force of the object. [29]: Introduction [30]: 5-6\nAcoustics is an academic field of research, control, transmission, reception and effects. [31] Ultrasonic, biological acoustic (English: BioacouseTICs) and electroacoustic (English: electrocousetics) are some important modern branches contained in acoustic. Ultrasonic studies exceed high frequency acoustic waves in human auditory capabilities, there are many important uses in medical diagnosis and medical treatment. The biological acoustic study involves the sound wave of animals. Electronic acoustic wave study electroacoustic device control. [32]\nOptics focus on the nature of light and the physical branch of behavior. [33] Light is considered to be rays in the geometry optics, and it can be changed in line until it encounters different media. Reflection, refractiveness, etc. can be explained by geometric optics. Light is considered to be light wave in physical optics, which can be used to describe diffraction, interference, polarization, and the like. [34]: 149\nThermodynamics mainly studies the conversion between heat and mechanical work. In thermodynamics, natural phenomena is generally explained through a macro variable, such as temperature, internal energy, entropy, pressure, and the like to describe the average properties of physical systems. Thermodynamics study these macro variables (such as Maxwell relationship), and their changes in the influence of physical systems. [35]: 51-56 The starting point of learning thermodynamics is the law of thermodynamics. The micro-properties of thermodynamics do not study substances, which belongs to the field of statistical mechanics. From the theory of statistical mechanics, the law of thermodynamics can be derived. [35]: 195 Research on statistical mechanics applications Physical behavior of a system consisting of particles. Statistical mechanics bridge the micro-properties of the individual atom or molecule to the macrodynamic nature of the bulk material, and the interpretation of the micro-hierarchy is given for these macro properties. These macrological properties can be measured in large-scale experiments. [36]: IX-X\nElectromagnetic description with electricity particles and electric fields and magnetic field interactions. Electromagnetic branches include electrostatic, static magnetic, electric mechanics, and more. Electrostatic study of interaction between stationary charged particles. Magnetic Studies All phenomena involving a constant magnetic field. Electrodynamic Studies All phenomena involving acceleration charged particles, electromagnetic radiation, time-variable electric field and time-varying magnetic field. The basic theory of classic electromagnetic is the Markish square formula and LORLLLLLOR [37]. The optical wave is one of electromagnetic waves, and can be generated by an acceleration motion of the charged particles. [38]\n\nModern physics [edit]\nMain entry: Modern physics\n The fifth Soli Conference held in 1927, the most excellent physicist at the time of the world gathered together, brain power, discussed quantum theory.\nClassic physics is usually used to illustrate system phenomena of daily observable size, and modern physics is usually used to illustrate extreme or very large size, very small-sized systems. For example, the minimum size of chemical elements can be identified is the size of the atomic physics or nuclear physics exploration material. The size of the particle physics operation is more small, which is discussed to be a basic particles or particles consisting of essential particles. Since the use of large particle accelerators to produce basic particles requires very huge energy, usually particle physics is also referred to as high energy physics. For the physical system studied by particle physics, those conventional common sense about space, time, substance, and energy are no longer applicable, must be modified. [25]: 269, 477, 561\nTwo core theories of modern physics give a new spoiler about space, time, substances, energy. Quantum mechanics discusses the discrete properties of the atomic hierarchy and the subharmonic level, and the complementary properties of particles and fluctuations in the description of these phenomena. Relativity, the observer in a reference system, observed in another one of the reference lines moving with relative speed. Relativity can also be divided into narrow relativism and general relativity. The difference between narrow and general relativity is whether the problem discussed is involved in gravity (bending time and space), that is, the narrow relativeism only involves problems that have no gravity or gravity can be ignored, and broad relativity is to discuss the topics involved in gravity. [25]: 1-4, 115, 185-187\n\n\nDifferences between Classic Physics and Modern Physics [Edit]\n According to the size and speed classification, the four fields of physics. [26]: 2\nA major research objective for physics is to discover General Law (English: Universal Law), which has no exception, but it seems that each physical theory is only applicable to certain clear values. [39]: Section 9.1, the law of classical physics can accurately describe a system having a length of large length than atomic scale and a speed of ultra-smaller than a radius. In this application range, the experimental results are not in line with theoretical forecast. The narrow relativeism thoroughly discards the concept of absolute time and absolute space, and is replaced by four-dimensional time and space, thereby accurately describes the system that is close to the light speed, that is, the relative argument system. [25]: Quantum mechanics does not seem like classic physics generally determine the physical behavior of macro objects, but statistically describe the physical behavior of micro-systems, it successfully passed the precision of today's test Complex experiment. [25]: 221-225 [40]\nQuantum field theory is unified, quantum mechanics and narrow relativity, is an indispensable basic theory of particle physics. [26]: 2 Electromagnetic interactions and weak interactions have also been combined into an weak interaction. [26]: 338-346 Physicians expect in the shortcomings, electromagnetic interactions, strong interaction, and weak interaction can be converged in the discussion of large-one theory. [26]: 84-85 Generalized relativity extends time and space into dynamic curved time and space, which can describe large-size structures of large quality systems and universe. [25]: 3-4 However, general relativity and other basic interactions have not been unified as a single theory; scientists are still developing several possible quantum gravity theories. [41]\n\nRelationship with other academic fields [edit]\n The parabolic lava flow exhibits Galileo's free fall law.\nPhysics complementary [edit]\nMathematics is one of the tools for studying physical essentials, including geometric, algebra, calculus, and more. To applying these mathematical tools, physicians can derive and calculate many interesting results from physical law. For example, in 1912, Turio Levichvi learned Albert Einstein to explore the relative theory of gravity, he met some setbacks, and he would persuade the Sintean learning tensile amount of calculus. Einstein adopted the suggestion of Levichva, diligent tension, and successfully founded general relativeism in 1915 [42]. Like most Britain's theoretical physics, Roger Panlos read college specialty mathematics, therefore has a deep mathematics, which can introduce topological methods into relativistic research, prove that there is a singular point in the center of every black hole, this It is a famous singularity in cosmology. [43]: 462, 469\nThe main role of mathematics in physics is not a good tool for deriving and calculus, and it also plays a more critical role: as an abstract language, it is precisely expressing the physical law. In fact, physical law must be expressed in a mathematical language before you can play the function of mathematical tools. Galileo mentioned in the 1622 book \"Analyst (English: IL Saggietore\" mentioned that mathematics is the language used in nature expressing its connotation. If it is not used, it is unable to understand any sentence of nature [44]. Physics relies on mathematics to give accurate formulas, accurate or approximate answers, quantitative results or predictions [45]. Richard Ferman also has similar sayings in the book \"The beauty of Physics (English: The Character of Physical Law\", he believes that people who don't know mathematics difficult to really understand the beauty of nature, especially the most profound natural Beauty ... If you want to know anything about nature, or want to appreciate the big nature, you must understand the language used in nature [46]\nWhile expressing physical law, the mathematical language also expresses the internal mathematical concept. For example, according to the quantum mechanics, there are two basic concepts in quantum mechanics: the quantum state of the physical system is represented by the unit vector of Hilbert, and the observable amount obtained from the observation physical system is to function. Elm operators of these vectors are represented. Once the corresponding mathematical concept of these two basic physics concepts, the theory of the entire linear algebra can be applied immediately to quantum mechanics. This highlights the importance and adaptability of mathematics [47].\nMathematical language is filled in mathematics theory, and its accompanying mathematical concept will often point out the road, sometimes even derived experience prediction. This is not just coincidence, but it is precisely in the relationship between mathematics and physics. For example, in 1915, when the broad relativity was originally created, there was no reliable empirical observation foundation. It was the most famous phenomenon that the best in the at that time was the abnormal progress of the Mercury, which was unable to explain. In 1919, the body physicist Jazz, Jazz, Orthesto, 1919, observed the exfolition of light in the sun gravity field (this experiment until 1959 began to quantitatively measured), which is a broad relativity The most powerful support. Today, the theoretical prediction of general relativity has been confirmed by experimental measurement [42].\n\nApplication and influence [edit]\n Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging of human brain.\n Computer simulation shows the heat of heat when space shuttle returns to the atmosphere.\nMain entry: Application physics\nPhysics is a basic science, not application science [48]. Physics is also considered to be basic science in basic science, as other natural science branches, like chemistry, astronomy, geophysics, biology theory must comply with physical law [49]: 94FF. For example, the nature, structure and chemical reaction of chemical studies (chemical focuses on atom size, which is the main boundary of chemical and physical). The formation of the structure is because the particles are interacting with each other. The energy conservation, calmness, charge conservation, etc. These physical law lead to material properties and chemical reactions, and in the past, chemists can only use various fuzzy concepts to establish a more correct understanding due to the development of quantum physics.\nApplying physics refers to physics research on practical use. Applying physics's curriculum rules usually select a course of application disciplines, like geology or motor engineering. Different physics and engineering, application physics does not specifically design certain components or machines, but use physical theory or physics research to develop a new technology or parse a problem.\nEngineering applications to many physical theories. For example, before learning the technology of building bridges and other buildings, you must first learn the theory of static learning. Designing world-class concert halls must first learn. Design and manufacturing more excellent optical components must be readily readily reading optics. Flying simulators, video games, movies, etc. designed by various physical factors, will look more vivid, vivid, and lifelike.\nThe nature, composition, structure, and variation of chemical study materials. The object of chemical studies involve the relationship between the substance, or the association between material and energy. Traditional chemistry is often regarding two substances contact, variation, a chemical reaction [50], or a substance to become another substance. These changes sometimes require electromagnetic waves, and among electromagnetic waves are responsible for exciting chemical effects. However, sometimes chemistry does not have to have a reaction between substances. The relationship between the spectroscopy study material and the light, and these relationships do not involve chemical reactions. Accurately, chemical research is included in the nuclear-electronic system, including molecules, electrons, ions, atoms, and atomic groups. [51] With the development of quantum physics, chemistry also absorbed quantum physics theory established a more complete theoretical basis.\nPhysics use some of the probe sources, and the method of reference can also be used in interdisciplinary fields. Physics or more affects many important academic areas, for example, economic physics applies a large number of physics to analyze economics, which often involves uncertainty or chaos.\n\nAcademic research [edit]\nScientific method [edit]\nMain entry: scientific method\nScientific approach is a systematic program for answering questions. Through this procedure, you can develop a reasonable explanation for nature phenomena. It often finds meaningful problems from observation of natural phenomena, reading books or discussions. If the problem is too complicated, it must be stripped with an insignificant part, find core ideas, simplify the problem, [52]: 191-192, thereby developing the problem to explain this issue and take the experiment test. After experimental test, it may be necessary to improve or dismiss for hypotheses. This strict process may repeat multiple times, until the prediction of false words can meet the experimental results, this hypothesis can be accepted by the academic community into scientific theories. [53]: 295-297 [54] [49]: 66FF\nThe experimental test must have the ability to grasp the scientific theory. Carl Popur emphasized that scientific theory must have documentation. In other words, it is necessary to compare the theoretical prophecy and the experimental results, if the two are inconsistent, the correctness of this scientific theory cannot be recognized. [55] However, in the near future, some chord theory scholars advocated with cosmic scholars, a theory of explanation of an interpretation of related issues and can not pass experimental tests, for example, so far, the string theory is the only four kinds The basic interaction theory, but the additional dimension concept it proposed is unable to be observed. In the universe, multiple universe theory, the agarism theory involves the discussion that cannot be observed. Theoretical Physics Paul Starn Hart said that the theory of universe is not scientific, because all observations will meet its prediction, in other words, it does not conflate fake. Whether these theories are scientific theory, it is necessary to study and debate more carefully. [56]\n\nTheory and experiment [edit]\nMain entry: experimental physics and theoretical physics\nPhysics research is roughly divided into theoretical research and experimental study. Richard Ferman show the same and different from the two: [49]: 39\n.mw-parser-output .templatequote {margin-top: 0; overflow: hidden} .mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite {line-height: 1em; text-align: left; padding-left: 2em; margin- Top: 0} .mw-parser-output .templatequote .TemplateQuotecite cite {font-size: small}\n\nTheoretical physicist imagined, deducement and guessing new law, but did not do experiments, and experimental physicians were experimenting, imagined, deducement and guess.\nTheoretical research and experimental study are generally separated, however they are closely related to each other, and it is not possible. The experimental results give recommendations for theoretical development, theoretical forecasting leads to experimental design. [57]: 148\nOver the past few hundred years, the experimental results have driven the progress of theoretical physics. In recent decades, the evolution of physics has been significantly changed, and in the field of physics branches, theoretical prediction drives the direction of experimental physics. In general, when the experimenter discovers a new phenomenon, the known theory cannot explain this new phenomenon, or when the prediction made according to the new theory can be inspected by designing exquisite experiments, paying a bold assumption, be careful Attitude, physics often make progress. [58] For example, various research on large brain colligations perfectly showed the complementary help of theoretical physics and experimental physics. Since the previous theoretical physicist predicts the existence of Higs Classic, the experimental physicians will persist in exploration of their traces. After decades of hard work, the Signs bolts were exactly exactly. Today, theoretical physics is waiting for more practical data to instruct the future theoretical research direction. [59]\nExperimental Physicians Design and Complete Experiments to Test the Prediction and Exploring New Physics. [60] Experimental physicians explore the mystery of nature, one is a negative approach, such as astronomical observer practices, because the physical behavior of the universe, the other is a positive way, like particle experimenter, Control particles to demonstrate their behavior and nature. [61] [62]: 1-2\nExperimental physics expanded engineering and sect The technology is also expanded by engineering and technology. Personnel involving basic research, when doing experiments, often exposure to advanced equipment like particle accelerators or lasers; those involved in application research, often in operation, development like positron emission computer fault scanning Technology, a class of crystal. Sometimes, some very interesting areas, although theoretical physics has not explored the argument, the experimenter will also do experimental test tests. [62]: 30-31 [46]: 157\nTheoretical physicist attempts to develop mathematical models, this model must be able to explain the physical phenomenon targeted by it, and the prediction of this model must also match the experimental data. [63]: 9 Theoretical physics should be possible to have the largest, and the least cost base research areas. Theoretical physics advances the basic knowledge of nature, but also spreads precious seeds for tomorrow technology. Semiconductors, solar cells, lasers, global positioning systems, light emitting diodes, nuclear fissures, nuclear magnetic resonances, etc. For human civilization, there are great contributions to the theoretical physicians. [64]\nImblegatic Experts strive to explore the intricate integration of theory and experiments; they focus on the complex phenomena observed from the experiment, trying to find the relationship between the complex phenomena and physical theory. Imblegation Experts calculate the forecast of the theoretical model and compare these predictions with experimental data. [65]: 111 [66]\n\nCategory and goals [edit]\nPhysics covers a wide range of natural phenomena, from minimal basic particles (like: quark, microcales, electronics) to huge superb starry groups are research objects. A lot of thousands of variables can be used to make reasonable descriptions and explanations in a more basic phenomenon. Physics is a basic science, [49]: 94FF physicians are committed to chasing the root causes of these phenomena, and trying to find any links. The results of the Physician Strive to Research are roughly summarized as some clear basic laws. Many of many academic areas, like biology, chemistry, geology, engineering, etc., the material systems involved are complied with these basic laws. However, these fundamentals are still incomplete. The description and explanation given by physics for natural phenomena, just approximation, not absolute facts. [67]: 3FF [49]: 66-71\nFor example, the ancient Greeks know that the substances like amber, when grinding with fur, will appeal, so that the two abrasives are attracted to each other. [68]: 50 This nature is later referred to as electricality. In the seventeenth century, scholars began to study this nature. [69]: 8 In addition, in the end of the Asian continent, the ancient Chinese observed some stone (magnet), which will attract each other through some kind of obsenerable force. [70] [71] This nature is later referred to as magnetic. In the seventeenth century, scholars began strictly poor their causes. [69]: 8 After the effort, the hard work, the hard work, the physicist finally understood the basic cause of these two natural phenomena - electricity and magnetic. However, in the twentieth century, through a more in-depth study, physicians found that electrical and magnetism were two different performances of electromagnetic interactions. Today, this unified various interacting procedures are still in the ascendants, and physicians believe that electromagnetic interactions and weak interactions are two different performances in electrical interactions. The ultimate goal of the physicist is to find a perfect universal theory that can explain all the nature of nature. [72]\n\nResearch field [edit]\nModern physics research is generally classified as astronomical physics, atomic molecules and photophysics, particle physics, coagulation physics, application physics, etc. [73] [74]. Some universities also provide physical education research [75].\nSince the 20th century, the more specialized in various fields of physics. Most physicists have only specially designed in a field, like Albert Einstein (1879-1955) and Pev Lang Road (1908) -1968) This whole talent now is now in Morning Star. [Note 1]\n\nParticle physics [edit]\n An event that simulates a compact scorpion coil in a large strong collision.\nMain entry: particle physics\nParticle Physics Study Composition of the basic particles of the substance, their structure interaction between them [76]. In addition, particle physic scholars design and development require high energy accelerator [77], detector and exploration of distributed processing systems, computer program [78] [79]. Due to the general conditions of nature, many basic particles do not exist, the existence of the life cycle is extremely short or unable to appear alone, and the physicians need to use extremely high energy particle accelerator collision to generate these basic particles, so particle physics is also High energy physics [80].\nThe standard model can correctly describe the interaction between basic particles. This model can illustrate 12 known particles (quark and light), which interacts with each other with strong strength, weak, electromagnetic or gravitational force. These particles will exchange specifications of the bicycles (which are gums, photons, W and z-Bangi). The standard model also predicted the existence of Higs. In 2012, the European Nuclear Research Organization announced that Kesius bolts were explored. [26]: 49-52 [81]\n\nAtomic molecules and photophysics [edit]\nMain entry: atomic molecules and photophysics\nAtomic molecules and photophysics focus on studying atomic, molecularities, and light, and studying interactions between substances and substances between substances. It is elucidated the basic law of physics to understand how substances are formed by grouping atoms and molecular hierarchies, understanding the interaction between light and substances, developing new technologies and new devices, which are central targets of atomic molecules and photophysics. Experiments and theoretical technologies for atomic molecules and photophysics, often applied to other scientific areas, such as chemistry, astronomical physics, biology, pharmaceutics, etc. For many other scientific sectors, through the development of methods on controlling and manipulating atoms, molecules and light, or by accurate measurement and analysis of their physical properties, or by developing new methods, the atomic molecules have a certain specific nature. Plays with optical physics play an en functioning role. [82]: 1\nThe structure and physical properties of atomic physics research atomic physics. [84] [85]: 148 Atomic physics research is mainly divided into three trends. The first is to study the law of nature, which usually involves high precision measurements. The second is to understand the structure of the atom, as well as the interaction between atoms and light. The third is to study the interaction between atoms and electrons, atoms and ions. [83]: 53\nMolecular physics attempts to understand the structure and physical properties of the molecules, how to interact with molecules and molecules, and more complex substances, such as liquids, and the like. Molecular physics is a learning across physics and chemical boundaries, which are commonly used for spectroscopy, diffraction, resonance, molecular beam, mass spectrometry, and more. The main research objectives of molecular physics are: molecular shape and structure, molecular symmetry, molecular energy state, molecular optical properties and electromagnetic properties, methods of detection molecules, in the field of technology and biology and pharmaceuticals . [83]: 88 [86]: 10-13\nPhotophysics study light properties, interactions between light and substances, including light generation and detection, linear and nonlinear optical processes, spectroscopy. Optical physics content and application optical, optical engineering is very neighbor. Optical physics focusing on light of light, application optics focusing on application related technologies in other scientific fields, while optical engineering focuses on the design and development of optical devices. Some forward-looking research areas are laser, laser spectroscopy, quantum optical and quantum coherent, femtosecond optical (English: femtosecond Optics), laser cooling, laser capture, etc. [83]: 110\n\nCondensed physics [edit]\n The speed distribution data of the atomic gas, which determines a new substantive called glass-Einstein aggregation.\nMain entry: condensed physics\nThe macrodynamic properties of condensed physics research materials, such as data obtained from the density, magnetization intensity, conductivity, thermal conductivity, and the like obtained from the measurement material, can be seen for the reaction of the external effect. The interaction between the particles and the particles is the premise of known interactions, and the coagulation physics gives the analysis and the description of the multi-level subsystem to give a working frame. Condensitive physics focuses on multi-particle systems, and the aggregate state is composed of a large amount of particles, and there is a strong interaction between particles and particles. [87]: 1-3 Common aggregate states have solid state and liquid, and these objects will occur due to chemical bonds formed between the atom and atoms. A more rare coagulation state includes superfluid and glass-Einstein condensed state that occurred in very low temperature systems, [89] [90] Superconstruction in the conduction electronics in some substances, [91] in a certain Some magnetic materials inside the dominant material and the anti-ferromagnetic state that occurred in the spin of the atomic lattice. [88]: 85-87\nConservation Law and Symmetry Detailed Subject The macroscopic nature of the substance is an important concept of condensed physics. In isolated systems consisting of a large number of particles, the number of particles, energy, momentum, and charges are all conserved. In sufficient high temperature conditions, this system has high symmetry, such as rotational symmetry and translation symmetry in the free space. Assume that the temperature is reduced, a new thermodynamic steady state is condensed, which has increasing symmetry, and therefore, the symmetry will become lower and lower. [88]: 1-3\nCondensed physics originated in the development of solid physics and low temperature physics in nineteenth century, today is the largest branch of physics, with chemistry, materials science, and nanotechnology have a considerable degree of overlap. [87] [92]\n\nAstronomical physics [edit]\nMain entry: Astronomical physics\n Haber super space is one of the most profound cosmic images taken by visible light.\nAstronomical physics mainly studies the nature and structure of the universe. [93] [94] This includes stars, planets, galaxy, nebula, dark star, black hole, etc. Astronomical and Cosmology is its sister academic field, it is difficult to do it strictly. Briefly, astronomical measuring the position, exercise, photometric, etc. The nature of the overall or large scale structure, for example, the mechanism of the big explosion or universe. [95]\nSince astronomical physics is a widely learned, astronomical physics usually requires many different academic theories, such as classic mechanics, electromagnetic, statistic, quantum mechanics, relativism, particle physics, etc., these academic theories Applying to astronomical research, such as gerberans, dense double stars, large-scale structures, star kinetics, etc., often get a meaningful answer. [96] [97]\n\nRecent studies [edit]\nMore information: Unresolved physics issues\n In the field of coagulation physics, Mysner effects causes the magnet to suspend the superconductor.\nAlthough physics is one of the oldest academics, today, there are still many breakthrough epoch-study in the field of physics, such as in full swing.\nIn the field of condensed state physics, certain substances are still superconductivity above 50 k, and physical scholars do not know why this high temperature superconducting phenomenon is [98]. Many aggregate experiments are to make the spin electronics element and quantum computer components [99] [87].\nIn the field of particle physics, experimental evidence of physics after supporting standard model has begun to appear. In these results, it is more important that the microbes have a non-zero quality. This experimental results have reasonable solution to the lack of remarkable solar neutrons, that is, some microcales will be converted to the inevitable microboni of the experiment from the solar path to the earth. Physical research with quality microcanons is a very hot theory and experimental topic. It is also an important topic that identifying microcales oscillation and anti-microbiological shock, which can be substances everywhere in the universe, rather than this cosmic puzzle. Many experiments are looking for inert, micro-mousse horses. [100]\nHigh-energy large strong collision has begun to detect 14TEV energy domains, exquisite post-standard models of the particles predicted, or about 85% of the cosmic substance, these are all high-stricken collimers. Explore the goal. European Nuclear Research Organization (CERN) announced that the big strong collision has discovered Higs bolts, but the number is limited, and its nature cannot be observed in detail. In the future, the future is collected more data, such as Higs Ballonians. The frequency of the decay pipe is expected to be able to find any physical behavior that does not meet the standard model and find any different kinds of Higs. [101]\nIn the field of theoretical physics, theoretical physicians tried to unify quantum mechanics and generalized relativity theory. This study has continued for more than half a century, but it has not been satisfied with the answer. Today, several successful theories are M theory, upper string theory, circle quantum gravity. [102]: 296\nIn the field of astronomy physics, many astronomical and universe are still not found, such as ultra-high energy cosmic rays, heavy subsequentity, galaxy rotation issues, etc. [104]: 60, 187-188. [106] Some important topics are listed below: [107] [108]\n\nThe initial and fate of the universe: try to explain the big explosion, the universe microwave background, the universe expansion, the universe, the universe, the dark matter, dark energy, etc.\nHow to study the evolutionary mechanism of the universe: How does the universe evolved from a big explosion to today's vast stars? What is the initial star, how the galaxies and black holes do? How do they affect the formation of astronomers? How do various astronomers formed?\nStudy neighboring lines: whether they are suitable for living, is there yet? How can I observe more information about them?\nAlthough high-energy physics, quantum physics, astronomical physics has great breakthroughs, scientists are still a transparent, for many phenomena involving daily generations involving complex systems, chaos, turbulence, etc.. [109]: 30 [111] The phenomenon of earthquake, break, life, etc. will only occur far away from the balance, and the system appears is called a depreciation balance system (English: Far-from-Equilibrium System System ). Many physical behaviors about balancing systems or near balance systems have been known, but physicians only know the basic principles of the leading balance system.

The ancient Greece Aquary has been balanced, the objective position of the object, the center of gravity, and the object of the object in the water, etc. Aristotle also proposes the action of motion, that is, the object is not stressed, will stop.\nAfter the revival of the literary revolution, the scientific revolution raised, Galileo's free falling movement law, and Newton's three major sports laws laid the foundation of kinetic. Mechanics began to become a science. Since then, the establishment of the basic equation of the elastic mechanics and fluid mechanics makes mechanics to gradually depth from physics and independent disciplines. By early 20th century, in fluid mechanics and solid mechanics, the actual application of the actual application and the math theory, so that many new theories were found, and there was also a large number of key issues in engineering technology.\n\nClassical mechanics and quantum mechanics [edit]\nMechanics can be divided into classical mechanics and quantum mechanics.\nIf you find the time to find it, classical mechanics have been discovered earlier, starting from the three major sports laws of Newton, quantum mechanics is founded by many scientists in the 20th century.\nClassical mechanics mainly study low speed or stationary macro objects. Cople, Galileo, especially Newton is the founder of classical mechanics.\nQuantum mechanics applications are wide, but it is mainly for microscopic substances. According to the corresponding principle, quantum number of quantum number can correspond to behavioral mode in classical mechanics, so that quantum mechanics and classical mechanics will not conflict. Quantum mechanics can explain and predict a number of behaviors of molecules, atoms, and basic particles. However, for generally common giant gains, if the quantum force learns to be complex to handle interaction between particles, the gauge system is still more appropriate to treat through classical mechanics.\n\nRelativity and Newtonian Mechanics [edit]\nQuantum mechanics extends mechanics to the range other than classical mechanics, while Einstein's broad relativity and narrow relativity will also extend the mechanics of Newton and Galileo to a larger range. When the object speed is close to the light speed, the effects of the object will lead the behavior of the object due to the relativity, and the speed will not exceed the light speed. Quantum mechanics also need to be corrected with relativism, quantum field theory is the combination of quantum mechanics and narrow relativism. However, quantum field theory and broad relativity are still unable to integrate, which is a problem that the big one is hoped to overcome.\n\nClassified according to research objects [edit]\nIn mechanics, it is common to use a term \"object\". Objects may be quality point, generals, spaceboats, stars, certain fluids, some solid, some machinery or some civil buildings.\nSome branches in mechanics are also related to the \"object\" characteristics discussed. For example, the quality point is a small object, which is only considered to have a quality point in classical mechanics. The rigid body has a fixed size and size, does not allow deformation, and the quality point comparison, the rigid body increases some parameters referred to as freedom, such as the direction in space.\nObjects may also be a semi-steam having allowable deformation, such as elastomers, or no fixed shapes at all, such as fluids. These objects can be studied by classical mechanics, and quantum mechanics can also be used.\nFor example, a baseball is often analyzed using classical mechanics, and the active behavior of the atomic nuclear proton and neutron usually describes quantum mechanics.\n\nMain branch discipline [edit]\nIn physics research, it is also useful to describe the behavior of the substance, called the field. Its description and mechanical use are somewhat different, which can be divided into classical fields and quantum fields. However, in practice, the content of the field and mechanics often have a close relationship. For example, the force acting on an object is often produced because of the electromagnetic field or gravity field, and when the object is actuated for other objects, the field is often produced.

Among a giant heat steelmaking furnace, iron oxide is a compound and carbon monoxide form iron (a single texture) and another compound: carbon dioxide.\n 1931 Chemistry Laboratory\n Workbench in the Laboratory of the College of Biochemistry, Cologne University\nChemistry is a subpropedic department that studies the nature, composition, structure, and changes in the law. The object of chemical studies involve the relationship between the substance, or the association between material and energy. Conventional chemistry is often a process of contact between two or more substances and subsequent changes, that is, chemical reaction [1], or a substance to become another substance. These changes sometimes require electromagnetic waves, and among electromagnetic waves are responsible for exciting chemical effects. However, sometimes chemistry does not have to react with the substance. The relationship between the spectroscopy study material and the light, and these relationships do not involve chemical reactions. Accurately, chemical research is included in the nuclear-electronic system, including molecules, electrons, ions, atoms, and atomic groups. [2] The word \"chemistry\" is the meaning of \"changing learning\" in the literal explanation. The primary study of chemicals [3] is scientific with each other. Chemical as a broader physics is the basic science of natural science. Many people are called \"central science\", because chemistry is the core of some scientific scholars, connection physics concepts and other science, such as materials science, nanotechnology, biochemistry, etc. Students studying chemistry are called chemists. All substances in the concept of chemists are consisting of atoms or more small and small than atoms, such as electron, neutron, and protons. [4] However, the chemical reaction is carried out in the least structure of atom or atomic group. Several atoms can constitute more complex structures such as molecules, ions or crystals in a certain manner. Contemporary chemistry has developed many different learning doors, usually every chemist only specializes in one, two. Chemical, chemist in the middle school curriculum is called ordinary chemistry. General chemistry is chemical introduction. The General Chemistry Course provides a simple concept of beginners into the field, and it is not very in-depth and accurate than the professional dominance, but ordinary chemicals provide chemists' intuitive and image. Even professionalist, still use these simple concepts to explain and think about some complex knowledge.\n\ntable of Contents\n\n1 word source\n2 history\n\n2.1 Human early understanding of fire\n2.2 Alchemy\n2.3 Early chemistry\n2.4 Modernization\n\n\n3 contemporary chemistry\n4 basic concept\n\n4.1 atom\n4.2 element\n4.3 substances\n\n4.3.1 Name Method\n\n\n4.4 molecule\n4.5 ions and salts\n4.6 acid alkaline\n4.7 Oxidation\n4.8 chemicals\n4.9 compound\n4.10 mole and substance\n4.11 chemistry bond\n4.12 molecular weight\n4.13 Physical Characteristics\n4.14 Chemical Reaction\n4.15 balance\n4.16 energy\n4.17 Chemical Law\n4.18 Chemical Industry\n\n\n5 subject classification\n6 See\n7 Notes and References\n\n7.1 References\n\n\n8 external connection\n\n\nWord source [edit]\nThe language of \"chemistry\" in English has a variety of statements. One statement is considered to be named \"Alchemy\". The word \"alchemy\" from the English \"Alkemie\" and \"Al-Kimia\" in ancient French language, meaning \"The Art of Transformation\". The word \"Kimia\" in Arabic is derived from Greek. There is also another saying that \"Chemistr\" in English Y \"The word\" k\u0113me \"in the Egypt is meaning\" Earth \".\nIn China, the term \"chemistry\" first appeared in the 2007 Mohai Library published journal \"Liuhe talk\" [5]. Weili Yatai mentioned Wang Hao recorded the word \"chemistry\" from Dai De Sheng, in his diary [6] [7]. The term \"chemical\" in Chinese is generally considered to be invented by Xu Shou translation of the book \"Chemical Approach\" book.\nThe term \"chemistry\" is introduced to Japan, replacing the translation of the original Japanese [8] [5].\n\nHistory [edit]\nMain entry: chemistry history\nSee: Chemical Year Table\nHuman early understanding [edit]\nThe earliest chemistry should be considered by human pairs. For the people at the time, the fire can turn an object into another object, so it has become the most interesting research at the time. If there is no fire, human beings will not find the refining method of iron and glass.\n\nAlchemy [edit]\nMain entry: alchemy\nHumans have discovered this valuable metal of gold, many people transfer research how to turn other substances into gold. From 300 years to 1500 BC, alchemists have studied how to convert some inexpensive metals into gold, thus accumulating the extraction and treatment of metals. Observation and technology. Some alchemist's main work is to manufacture drugs, and China is also an alchemy. Before 2000, humans have widely used gold, silver, mercury, copper, iron and bronze. The human civilization at the time had certain achievements in ceramics, dyeing, brewing, paper, gunpowder, etc., in technical experience, the understanding of material changes has been observed and delivered.\n\nEarly chemistry [edit]\n Gormile\nEarly chemists collected many different substances. Before the 17th century, chemical achievements were not large (the aggregate, alchemy), including more accomplished, such as Robert Yishe. In 1750, chemistry still has mysterious colors and dominates for incorrect theories. Until 1773, Antoan Lauren Deca proposed the quality of quality conservation, and explained the combustion phenomenon with an oxidation reducing reaction, overthrew the \"intersection of the medieval\", only opened the path of modernization; he Therefore, it is respected as \"the father of chemistry\". Then Dalton integrates chemical knowledge at the time and proposes an epoch-called atom with its own experiment. Since then, some chemists have discovered various chemical elements, and later the door Lev has established an elemental cycle to make the chemical vision more complete. In 1901, the chemist Nobel settled the Nobel Chemical Award in its heritage to express contributors in the chemical field.\n\nModern chemistry [edit]\nModern chemistry begins in quantum mechanics that flourish in the early 20th century. The essence of the quantum mechanics in the introduction of the quantum mechanics to describe the linear superposition of the wave function. The discovery of protons, neutrons, and electrons, enabling chemistry to actually understand chemical reactions from atomic scale. Quantum mechanics and electronics have enabled many new instruments to explore and analyze the structure and components of the compound, such as spectrometers, chromatographs, nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometers.\n\nContemporary chemistry [edit]\n People who are doing experiment\nContemporary chemistry is roughly divided into four universal gates, and there are many extension of subgramation and application chemistry.\nThe four universities are mainly:\n\nPhysical chemistry is a chemical door of chemical principles from physical perspective, which can be described as the principles of modern chemistry. Physician focuses on how the molecules form structures, dynamic changes, molecular spectroscopy, as well as basic problems such as balance states, involving thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, etc. Important physical fields. Generally speaking, physical chemistry is the most accurate numerical value in the four universities and the rigorous theoretical architecture.\nAnalysis of chemical development analyzes material ingredients, structural and amounts, enabling chemical components to qualitative or quantify, and chemical structures are determined. From analysis, analytical chemistry can also be divided into chemical analysis and instrument analysis. Analytical chemistry is one of the most basic training of chemists. The training of chemists in experimental technologies and basic knowledge is hard to analyze chemistry. Contemporary analytical chemical focused instrument analysis, commonly used instrument analysis methods have the following: spectroscopy (such as ultraviolet spectrophotometry, infrared spectroscopy, atomic emission spectroscopy, atomic absorption spectrometry, X-ray diffraction method, Raman spectroscopy, etc. ), Chromatography, such as thin layer chromatography, gas chromatography, liquid chromatography, electrophoresis, etc.), electrochemical analysis (such as voltammetry, electroluminescence, conductance analysis, etc.), mass spectrometry, energy spectrum Method.\nOrganic chemistry has chemical doors of compounds composed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur and other elements. Organic chemistry mainly studies the synthesis pathways and methods, institutions and physical properties of organic compounds. Due to the application of organic chemical heights and a long history of development, it is usually seen by the Proan public as a synonym of contemporary chemistry. The development of organic synthesis and new response pathways, the development of drugs, natural materials, biological and material polymons, is extremely important, which has a great impact on chemical industry.\nThe chemical field of the inorganic chemical organic compound is found in the chemical field of compounds, the synthesis pathways, mechanisms and physical properties of the compounds, the most common molecular system, is a metal compound. There are often overlap, and even have a unusable trend in organic and inorganic chemistry. Organic metal chemistry is a chemistry in combination with organic and inorganic.\nOther extensions and applications:\n\n Potonder, a biochemical common experimental instrument\nTheoretical Chemistry From Physics Theory to explain the various chemical phenomena.\nCalculate chemistry due to the complexity of molecular systems, molecules, dynamics, structures, often unable to calculate quantum mechanics. Therefore, chemistry provides various simple calculation methods to predict and assist the experimental results. The Personal Nobel Prize has been affirmed, such as the Density Function Method of Nobel Chemical Award in 1998.\nBiochemistry is a discipline that studies the chemical reactions and interactions of the biology, which is used to study the structure and function of each component (eg, protein, carbohydrate, lipid, nucleic acid, and other biomolecules). Biochemistry is widely used in the research of various chemical properties of proteins, in particular to enzymatic reactions.\nThermochemistry is to study chemistry, enthalpy, entropy, and state functions of thermodynamics to describe and predict the stability of chemical substances and chemical reactions.\nElectrochemistry is a scientific academic door to studying various chemical effects caused by electricity due to electricity or willing to generate electricity in operation. Various batteries in life are electrochemical research results.\nPhotochemical studies various chemicals, chemical reaction changes after irradiation of various frequency rays.\nHow to use chemical substances in pharmaceutical chemicals to change the effect of the agent and make medical effects. It is actually a few chemistry, including organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, biochemistry, physics, and several science doors that are not chemical, including: combination of pharmacy, molecular biology and statistical.\nQuantum chemical quantum mechanics and other pure theoretical means to explain various chemical phenomena.\nNuclear chemistry studies how different atomic particles go together, form an atomic core, and study how the substances in an atomic core changes.\nRadiation chemistry is a branch of chemistry to study a subject of substances involved in chemical reactions or chemical responses with radioisotopes. For example, a variety of proteins or hormones are labeled with iodine radioisotop 125i to detect the concentration of the corresponding substances in serum specimens by radiological immunoassay techniques.\nThe chemicals of space chemistry have analyzed their ingredients, and the structure is different from the substances on the earth.\nAtmospheric chemistry is a study on the atmospheric layer of the Earth atmosphere and other planets. Atmospheric chemistry will study what chemical reaction in the way of environmental changes is an important branch discipline of atmospheric science.\nEnvironmental chemical research chemicals enter different natural environment, after physics, chemistry, and biological reactions, whether the product formed is harmful to human body and ecology.\nHow to reduce pollution from the chemical angle.\nInformation chemistry uses computers to solve chemical problems.\nThe chemical properties of various substances in the geochemical study of the earth chemistry, explaining their configuration.\nFeatures and refining techniques of oil and gas from chemical perspective.\nPolymer chemistry is relatively large, that is, polymer, such as how the foaming gum is made and some characteristics. High molecular chemistry will also study how many molecules are combined into a polymer.\nSuper molecular chemistry research is a variety of chemical bonds outside the covalent bond, for example: hydrogen bond, Van Dew Hua, and hydrophobic effect.\nBasic concept [edit]\nAtom [edit]\nMain entry: atom\nOne atom is a particle composed of an atomic core and a negative charge electron (called nuclear external electron), which is generally the minimum scale category of chemical studies. The nuclear nuclei is usually composed of protons and neutrons. Unlike the usual physical concept, a single proton is considered to be a 1H (\u6c15) atomic nucleus in the chemical field, that is, the atomic nucleus will inevitably contain protons, but may not contain neutron.\nThe electron with negative charge, proton tape positive charge, and the number of charge balances, so that the entire atom is electrically neutral. When the number of nuclear extracted electrons is different from the nucleus of the nucleus, ions are formed. It is generally considered to be one of the atoms.\n\n Structure of helium atoms\nElement [edit]\nMain entry: chemical elements\nThe same atoms with the same proton number are called \"elements\". For example, all atoms in the hydrogen are only one proton. This concept is changed. It is also possible: All hexagonal atoms in all nuclear nuclei are carbon, and there are ninety-dollars in all nuclear nuclei are uranium. Elements also have another definition, that is, all materials that cannot be decomposed by chemical methods are elements.\nIn such a variety of methods of enumerating elements, most common and most convenient is the elements periodic table. The periodic table is arranged in accordance with the atomic order, and the atomic order is the number of protons in one atom. Because of this strange arrangement, the elements of the row, whether the same straight, the same rampant is still nearby, have some substantially fixed relationship.\nThe same element may have a lot of different nuclides. Their number of protons is the same and the number of neutrons is different, and the chemical properties are the same. However, due to their difference in neutron, there is a different nuclear stability, and some nuclides have radioactivity. Different kits of the same element occupy the same position in the element cycle table, so different nucleosides of the same element are mutual alternative. For example, 1H (\u6c15) and 2H (deuterium) mutual mutory isotope.\n\n Element cycle table\nMaterial [edit]\nMain entry: chemical\nChemicals refer to an object that determines its chemical composition and its chemical properties [9]. In strict, mixed compounds, elements, etc., can not be considered chemicals, can only be said to be chemical or chemicals. Most of our daily life encounters chemicals are mixtures, such as air, alloys, biological products.\n\nName method [edit]\nMain entry: chemical nomenclature\nThe nomenclature of the substance is the most stringent ring in the chemical language. As long ago, the title of the compound was determined by its discovery, so that naming difficulties and confusion. Now we are most commonly used or international pure and application chemical federation (IUPAC) naming methods. It uses a naming system to let all compounds have a unique name and code. Organic compounds are named after organic naming [10] system; inorganic compounds are named after system named [11] system. Through the chemical index service (Chemical Abstracts Service), we can easily find the nature, characteristics, naming and structure of each compound through the CAS Registry Number.\n\nMolecule [edit]\nMain entry: molecule\n A molecular structure formula describes a chemical bond and its position in which the atom connected in it is, a molecular structure of paclitaxel is\nOne molecule is the most basic structure of the compound, and the chemical method is not unfolded. Most of the molecules consist of two or more atoms, but there are some special examples, such as helium molecules, only one atom. These atoms, if more than one, is combined by chemical bonds.\n\nIons and salt [edit]\nMain entry: ion\nIons are charged substances, which can be lost or electronically formed by atom or molecules. Positive ions (such as sodium ions Na +) and negative ions (e.g., chloride CL-) can become a charge neutral salt (e.g., salt NaCl). Some ions are composed of several atoms, while they do not separate, such as phosphate ions (PO43-), ammonium ions (NH4 +). The ion of the gas phase is generally referred to as a plasma.\n\nAcid alkaline [edit]\nMain entry: acid base theory\nThe substance can be classified as an acid or a base. Usually we have several theories of acid base classification definition. Among them, the easiest import of Arrhenius Theory, it believes: acid is a substance that is capable of ionizing hydrate ions in water; while the opposite base is ionized in water to ionure ions . BR\u00d8NSTED-LOWRY ACID-Base THEORY is considered to be a substance that can give other substance hydrogen ions in a chemical reaction; and the base is a substance that can obtain hydrogen ions. The third theory is called the Lewis Acid-Base Theory, which is based on the formation of a chemical bond. Louis Theory believes that acid is a pair of electrons in the formation of bonds; and the base is a pair of electrons to other substances in the process of forming a bond. Therefore, if a substance may be acidic for different acid-base theories, it is a base in another theory.\nThe measurement method of acidity is mainly two types: the first is that Arezus definition is the most commonly used pH, which is determined by measuring the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution to determine the size of the acidity. Its calculation method is pH = -LOG10 [H +], that is, the pH is equal to the negative of the hydrogen ion concentration (at 10). It can therefore be said that there is a higher concentration of hydrogen ion solution, the lower the pH, and the acid is stronger. The second is Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry definition, that is, acid-to-regular (KA), which measures the ability of the substance as acid as acid to give hydrogen ions. Therefore, the stronger the acidity, its Ka is higher, and the tendency to give hydrogen ions. Similarly we can use POH instead of pH, KB instead of KA, will express alkaline strength.\n\nOxidation [edit]\nMain entry: redox reduction\nThe concept of redox reduction and the ability of a substance atomic acquisition or the ability to electronically. The ability of the substance has oxidative other substances is becoming oxidative, and this substance is becoming an oxidant (Oxidizing Agents) or as an oxide. An oxidant can remove electrons from other substances. Correspondingly, the substance having other substances is referred to as reducing reducing agent (Reducing Agen) TS) or become a reducing. A reducing reagent can be transmitted to other substances electrons and oxidize itself. It is precisely because of its \"given\" other substance electrons, it is also known as the supplier electronic matter. The nature of the redox reduction is related to the oxidation number - in fact, the true or acquired electron does not exist. Therefore, the oxidation process is defined as increasing the number of oxidation, and the principle is reduced by the number of oxidation.\nSimply, the oxidation reaction refers to the reductant to lose electrons, and the coincide is rising; and the reduction reaction is referred to as electrons, but the chemical price is lowered. Oxidation and reduction reactions must be carried out simultaneously.\n\nChemical [edit]\nChemicals generally refer to the substances that have indeed chemical structure and chemical compositions, so they are also known as chemicals. They may be elements, compounds or mixtures. In daily life, most of what we will encounter is a mixture, such as an alloy.\n\nCompound [edit]\nMain entry: compound\n Crystallization of a sodium chloride (salt)\nCompounds are some substances that are combined with a fixed ratio of different elements. The proportion of ingredients determine its chemical properties. For example, water is combined with hydrogen in two to two, and the three atoms constituting the water molecules constitute 104.5 degrees. Changes between different compounds and elements are referred to as chemical reactions.\n\nMoore and substances [edit]\nMain entry: Moore (unit)\nMoore (English: Mole, only in Taiwan \"Moore\" one word) is an international unit of the material, the symbol is mol. 1 mole is the number of basic particles and 12 grams of carbon-12 (\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n\n\n{\\ DisplayStyle {} _ {6} ^ {12} \\! {\\ mbox {c}}}\n\nThe amount of a system substance containing the number of atoms contained. When using molar, the basic particles should be specified, which may be molecular, atom, ion, electron or other basic particles, or a particular assembly of a basic particle. The number of basic particles contained in the molar material is equal to the Avo Gado constant, the symbol is NA, the value is 6.0214129 \u00d7 1023, and 6.02 \u00d7 1023 is often taken.\nThe molecular weight and molecular weight of a substance is in terms of using international units, and the value is equal.\n\nChemical bond [edit]\nMain entry: chemistry\n Atomic electronics and molecular tracks\nChemical bonds refer to the force of mutual action between the particles of the molecule or material, wherein the particles may be atoms, ions or molecules. The physical essence of the chemical bond is derived from the electrostatic force between particles and particles, and quantum mechanics means that the wave function linear superposition of the atomic electrons. Chemical bonds are one of the most important concepts of chemistry, and the physiotheoretical nature is established by Lenas Bown. The chemist can simply express the chemical bond and avoid the complexity of quantum mechanics, classify the chemical bond into covalent bonds, ionys, and metal bonds, and weaker bonds such as hydrogen bonds and more special coordination interactions. Regardless of the classification, its physical essence is the same.\n\nMolecular strength [edit]\nMolecular interstitational force is the force between different molecules, mainly hydrogen bonds, Van Dew Huawei, hydrophilic effect / hydrophobic effect, this force is better than chemical, easy to open or recombine, but is a molecular spatial arrangement and architecture The important role is one of the important research directions of modern chemistry.\n\nPhysical characteristics [edit]\n The water in the sand is put on the beach, which is the physical characteristics of water and sand.\nSubstances are sometimes liquid, sometimes the solid, sometimes gas, which is called a substance. Whether a substance is soft, translucent, and it is a refractive index, which is the physical characteristics of a substance. In summary, physical properties are characteristics that can be disconnected by a substance without chemistry.\n\n\nChemical reaction [edit]\nMain entry: chemical reactors: chemical changes\n Hydrogen chloride is chemically reactive to form ammonium chloride\nChemical reactions, also known as chemical changes is a process of transition to another substance, involving transfer, formation or disappearance of chemical bonds in molecules. Changes in chemical reaction can be combined with many independent molecules, and a larger molecule can be unpubged into a lot of separate small molecules, even in the same molecule, even if the number of atoms does not change, but still Composition of chemical reactions.\nChemical changes, also known as the chemical reaction is a process of transition to another substance, involving the exchange, formation or disappearance of the atom's exchange and chemical bonds in the molecule. Changes in chemical changes can only make many independent molecules, and a larger molecule can be opened to a lot of separate small molecules, even with an atomic movement in the same molecule, even if the number of atoms has not changed, but still Component chemical changes.\n\nBalance [edit]\nMain entry: chemical balance\nAlthough the balance concept is widely used in the fields of science, in chemistry, chemical balance refers to a variety of different states in chemical components, such as in a mixture of several compounds that can react with each other, or when the substance can When there is more than one kind of phase.\nEven if there is a constant chemical composition, chemicals in balancing systems are generally not in a static state; the molecules of these substances continue to react, thereby generating dynamic balance. Therefore, chemical balance describes a state in which parameters such as chemical components remain unchanged over time.\n\nEnergy [edit]\nChemical law [edit]\nMain entry: chemical law\nThe conservation of chemical reactions must meet the law of physical conservation, and the reaction should be compliant before and after:\n\nQuality Conservation Law: A chemical reaction occurs, and the total quality of the substance will not change.\nEnergy Conservation Law: The sum of energy generated by the chemical reaction is not changed, but the energy form varies in accordance with the reaction mode. Lead three important concepts: balance, thermodynamics, kinetics.\nCharge Conservation Law: The amount of charge before and after chemical reaction should be conserved.\nAvo Gado Law\nBill - Lamber Law\nYoshihe Purchase (1662, pressure and volume)\nCharlie Law (1787, volume and temperature)\nFik diffusion law\nGaid Lusak Law (1809, pressure and temperature)\nHenry Law\nHerx Law\nDependency law\nBimi law\nRaul Law: The ideal solution is proportional to the molecular ratio of each component of each component of each component in the solution, and the proportional coefficient is equal to the vapor of each component. Pressure. (One of the basic laws of physical chemistry)\nChemical industry [edit]\nMain entry: chemical industry\nChemical Industry (Chemical) is an important part of contemporary economic activity. The 50-year-old chemical manufacturer sold a total of $ 587 billion in 2004, of which 8.1% is occupied, including 2.1% of R & D costs [12]\n\nSubject classification [edit]\nInorganic chemistry is chemically studied in inorganic compounds.\nElement chemistry\nInorganic synthetic chemistry is mainly constructed by a wide variety of inorganic reactions.\nOrganic chemistry is the structure, nature, and prepared disciplines of organic compounds, also known as chemicals of carbon compounds.\nOrganic Metal Chemistry is a branch course in organic chemistry and inorganic chemistry, and studies organometallic compounds containing metal (including metal) and carbon atom-bonded organometallic compounds, their chemical reactions, synthesis and other issues.\nOrganic synthetic chemistry\nNatural organic chemistry\nAnalytical chemistry is to develop analytical material components, structural and quantity methods, engeting chemical components to be qualitatively or quantitative, and chemical structures are determined.\nAccording to the analysis target, it can be divided into qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis.\nQualitative analysis Main task is to determine the component of the substance\nQuantitative analysis requires analysis of the content of each component in the substance\nAccording to the analysis, it can be divided into chemical analysis and instrument analysis.\nChemical analysis\nInstrument analysis is to use the physical method of the instrument to measure the physical and chemical properties of the substance, and experimentally change to determine its chemical composition, elemental content, and even chemical structures.\nBiochemistry is a discipline in the chemical process in the graduate, often referred to as biochemical.\nMaterial Chemistry (Materials Science or Material Engineering) is a multidisciplinary area, involving material properties and its application in various science and engineering. It is a scientific study of the study of the preparation or processing of the material, the microstructure of the material and the macro performance of the material.\nNuclear chemistry is also known as nuclear chemistry, research atomic (stability and radioactivity), and one subject, nature, structure, separation, and identification.\nPhysical chemistry is a discipline of the principles, laws and methods of chemical behavior from physical perspectives, which can be described as the principles of modern chemistry.\nTheoretical chemistry uses non-experimental estimates to explain or predict the various phenomena of compounds. In recent years, theoretical chemistry mainly includes quantum chemistry, that is, to apply quantum mechanics to solve chemical problems.\nQuantum chemistry is a discipline for the application of quantum mechanics to study chemical problems.\nStructural chemistry is a discipline studying atomic, molecular and crystal structure and relationship between structural and performance. In recent decades, this discipline has developed rapidly. The structure of chemical ideas not only penetrates all kinds of chemical branch disciplines, but also applied in technology, materials, materials, mine, geology.\nOther, such as radiation analysis, isotope chemistry, radiation chemistry, nuclear fuel, reactor and fission chemistry, geochemistry, marine chemistry, atmospheric chemistry, environmental chemistry, cosmochemistry, intertrochemistry, drug chemistry, neurochemistry, agricultural chemistry, oil Chemical, wood chemistry, soil chemistry, coal chemistry, food chemistry, chemical geography, celestial chemistry, rock chemistry, spatial chemistry and colloides and interface chemistry, etc.\n\nSee [edit]\n\n\nChemical theme\n.mw-parser-output .refbegin {font-size: 90%; margin-bottom: 0.5em} .mw-parser-output .refbegin-henging-indeents> ul {list-style-type: none; margin-left: 0} .mw-parser-output .refbegin-henging-indents> ul> li, .mw-parser-output .refbegin-henging-indeft: 0; padding-left: 3.2em; Text -indent: -3.2em; list-style: none} .mw-paser-output .refbegin-100 {font-size: 100%}\nNobel Chemistry Award\nElement list\nchemical industry\nChemical substance list\nChemical language list\nElement cycle table\nchemist\nIsotope list\nChemical basic topic list\nComparison of chemistry and physics\n\nNotes and References [edit]\n\n\n^ Chemistry (n.d.).

It uses methods such as mathematics, physics and chemistry to explain the celestial body between the universe, including planets, satellites, comets, stars, galaxies, etc., and various phenomena, such as supernock explosions, gamma Radial, universe microwave background radiation, etc. In general, any phenomenon from the earth atmospheric layer is a research range of astronomy.\nPhysical cosmology is closely related to astronomy, but it depends on the universe as an overall study. [1]\nAstronomy has an ancient history. Self-text records, Babylon, Ancient Greece, Indian astronomy, ancient Egyptian astronomy, Nubia, Iran, China, Mayan, and many ancient American civilizations have a detailed observation record on night sky.\nAstronomy has also involved in the history of celestial measurement, astronomical navigation, observing astronomy and calendar, today, is generally synonymous with the geometric physics. [2]\nIn the 20th century, astronomy gradually divided into two branches of observations astronomy and theoretical astronomy. Observing astronomy is mainly analyzed by the observation data of the celestial body, and then analyzes the basic physical principles; theoretical astronomy is developed to analyze the computer model and analysis model for analytical day. The two complement each other, theory can explain the observation results, and observations can be confirmed.\nUnlike many modern science categories, astronomy still has a more active amateur community. Amateur astronomers have an important role in the development of astronomy, especially in discovering and observing a short astronomical astronomy of comets.\n\ntable of Contents\n\n1 language source\n2 history\n\n2.1 Scientific Revolution\n\n\n3 observation astronomy\n\n3.1 Radio Astronomy\n3.2 Infrared Astronomy\n3.3 Visible Guang Tianxue\n3.4 UV Astronomy\n3.5 x-ray astronomy\n3.6 gamma ray astronomy\n3.7 Not in electromagnetic radiation observation\n3.8 Mechanical Mechanics and Mechanics\n\n\n4 Theory Astronomy\n5 specific branch\n\n5.1 Sun Astronomy\n5.2 Planetary Science\n5.3 Stepping Astronomy\n5.4 Galaxy Astronomy\n5.5 galaxy astronomy\n5.6 Physical Cosmology\n\n\n6 interdisciplinary research\n7 Amoughing Day Literature\n8 days of literature illegal mystery\n9 See\n10 References\n11 book\n12 external connection\n\n\nSource [edit]\nThe term \"astronomy\" in Chinese appeared in \"Yi Chuan\". \"Yijing \u00b7 \u5366 \u00b7 \u5f56\u5f56\": \"Just soft, astronomy; civilization, humanities, observation, time change; watching humanities, \u5316 \u6210 \u5929\u4e0b.\" \"\" \" The phenomenon or the shape, \"astronomy\" refers to nature. [3] [4]\n\nHistory [edit]\nMain entry: the history of astronomy\nMore information: Archaeological astronomy and astronomer list\n 17th century star chart, Dutch mapper Frederick De Wit (English: Frederik DE WIT)\nEarly day literature can only predict the beef eye visible. Some ancient cultural buildings may have a huge building that may have an astronomical observations, in addition to the ceremony, it can also be used to judge the date of the season, farming and the length of the year. [5]\nPrior to the inventions of telescopes, people can only use the naked eye to observe the night sky. In Meso Namia, ancient Greece, Persia, India, China, Ancient Egypt and Central America, people began to build an observatory and think of the essence of the universe. Early day literature is mainly based on record stars and planets in the heavens, today this category is called celestial measurement. On the basis of these observations, the philosophical idea of \u200b\u200bthe movement of the planet is started, the status of the sun and the moon in the universe. Many cultures regard the earth as the center of the universe, and the sun and the moon are rotated around the ground. [6]\nBabylon is the earliest cultural and scientific methods of researching the cultures of the sky, which focuses on the astronomical research of other cultures in the future. [7] For example, Babylonian It is found that the monster will occur periodically, and they call the sassa. [8]\n\n The first 3 to the first 2nd century ancient Greek equatorial day, today Afghan Ai-Hanum (English: Alexandria on the Oxus unearthed\nThe Babylonian research sky is then ancient Greek culture. Ancient Greek astronomy is characterized by rationality, reality-based approaches to explain astronomy. [9] The first century BC, Alisaks estimated to estimate the size and distance of the sun and the moon, published \"The Size of Sun Month\" (Ancient Greek: \u03c0\u03b5\u1f76\u1f76 \u03bc\u1f00\u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u1ff6\u1ff6\u1ff6 \u03c9\u03c9\u1f76\u1f76\u1f00\u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u1f76\u1f76\u03c9\u03c9\u03c9\u1f21\u1f21\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u1f76 \u03c3\u03b5\u03bb\u03ae\u03b7\u03b7))) One, and the first time Propose the sun of the sun. [10] In the first 2nd century BC, Xipchas found the difference in the year, and estimated the size and distance of the moon, invented the world's earliest astronomical instrument - stars, [11] also compiled 1020 stars Detail of a star table. [12] Antique Tella Mechanical (about 150 to 80 years) is an analog computer that can calculate the exact position of Sun Moon Planet on a certain day. Such a complex astronomical instrument, waiting until the 14th century European invented the mechanical astronomical clock, it appeared again. [13]\nDuring the medieval period (until the 13th century), European astronomy was stagnant. At the same time, astronomical astronomical in Islamic world and other cultures flourish (see Islamic Astronomy in Activities). At the beginning of the 9th century, the earliest observatory in Islamic world. [14] [16] In 1994, Persian Tianxians' A Zuo Fei found the largest cluster of the star in this star group and recorded in the \"Book of Stars\". [17] The supernova Sn 1006, 1006 years, is a history of the highest celestial event, such as the high-asterity of the Star, Egypt, Arabian, Ali Ibre, Rid, English: Ali IBN Ridwan, and Chinese astronomers have recorded. There is also a big contribution to astronomy in the Islamic world: Batani, Thabit (English: TH\u0101bit Ibn Qurra), Abu Mashar, Buni, Al - Sauerry (English: Ab\u016b ish\u0101q ibr\u0101h\u012bm Al- Zarq\u0101l\u012b, Al-Birjandi, and Malaga Observatory (English: Maragheh Observatory) and the Rusbeck Observatory (English: UluGH BEG), and more. The Islamic astronomers are naming stars during this period, there are still many universal in Western. [18] [19] Archaeologists believe that the building remains found in the Dajin Babwe and Tingbucku [20] are likely to be an observatory. [twenty one]\n\nScience revolution [edit]\n Galileo sketch of the moon. He found that the moon surface is covered with irregular mountains.\n Early European map, about 1000 years\nDuring the Renaissance, Nikola, Nikola, proposed the sun. Galileo Galilele and Johannes Cape will further improve the daily heart on the basis of Copernico. Galileo saw the heavenly body by the telescope, found that the moon surface was covered with irregular mountains, not a smooth. In 1610, Galileo found four satellites of Jupiter, which is a major blow to the ground. [twenty two]\nJohannes Cape is the earliest discontinuation of scientific laws that correctly explain the day heart, but he can't explain the scientific principle behind these laws. [23] After that, Izak Newton made the law of physical strength and extravaratory law, and founded the operation of the planet. The reflected telescope is also invented by Newton. [twenty two]\nBritish astronomers John Flemstad compilation compilation compilation of more than 3,000 stars. [24] With the increase in the size and quality of the telescope, astronomers have discovered more utensils and astronomical phenomena. French astronomers Nikla Loui Lakay's star table contains nearly 10,000 Nantian stars. William Herch compiled the nebula, the star group star Table, and found the seventh planet Tianwangxing in 1781. This is the first new planet that has been discovered since ancient times. [25] In 1838, Friedrich William Besell used the principle of parallax to measure Tianjin's distance, which was the distance between the first successful measurement. [26]\nIn the 18th to 19th centuries, Li Anner Ou La, Alexys Claude Claude, let Sherang Daren Bell study the three-body problems, making more accurate predictions on the operation of moon and planets. Joseph Lagranda and Piehr - Simon Lapus On this basis, the quality of their quality is calculated from the orbital disturbance of satellite and planets. [27]\nAfter new technologies such as spectrometers and astronomical photography, astronomy has a fast development. From 1814 to 15 years, Joseph Fake and the spectra of the sun were observed by about 600 spectries. Gustav Kirhof explained in 1859 that these lines were produced by different chemical elements. People find that the star is actually similar to the sun, but there is only different temperatures, quality and size. [18]\nIn the 20th century, scientists realized that the Galaxy in the Earth is a separate galaxy, and there are other galaxies in the Galaxy. These galasses are far from the Galaxy, and scientists find that the universe is expanding. [28] The singularity of the singular star is discovered, such as a gear, pulse star, a flaw and electric wavestorming. Theoretical astronomers provide black holes, neutrons and other celestial bodies to explain these observations. Physical cosmology is also booming in the 20th century, and the big explosive theory has been fully supported by universe microwave background radiation, Hubble Law and the abundance of cosmic chemical element. The launch of space telescope means that scientists can observe the universe by a portion that is generally covered by the atmosphere. In 2016, the Lei Dienity Gravity Wave Observatory announced the first time to directly detect gravitational waves from the black hole collision, launched an era of gravity wave as an astronomical observation.\n\nObserving astronomy [edit]\nMain entry: observing astronomy\nLight, or even electromagnetic radiation is the main observation pathway of humanity to the sky. [29] Observation Astronomical in different fields can be divided according to the region of electromagnetic spectrum, and some wavelengths can be observed from the surface of the Earth, and some of them must be effectively observed outside the high altitude or even in the Earth atmosphere.\n\nEmission astronomy [edit]\n Very large antenna array in New Mexico, USA is a radio telescope\nMain entry: radio astronomy\nThe radio astronomy is observed using electromagnetic radiation having a wavelength of about 1 mm. [30] and other types of observation astronomy areas are different, and radio waves observed by radio astronomy can be considered wave, rather than individual photons, so relatively short wavelength radiation is more easily determined to determine the velocity and phase. [30]\nAlthough the thermal radiation of the celestial self also emits radio waves, most of the radio waves are synchronous radiation, that is, the radiation that is emitted when moving in the magnetic field. Further, some lines generated by the interstellar gases are also within the wavelength range of radio waves, especially hydrogen 21cm lines. [31] [30]\nThe celestial bodies that can observe through radio waves include superflow stars, intersecting stars, and active galaxies. [31] [30]\n\nInfrared astronomy [edit]\nMain entry: infrared astronomy\n Chile's Athama's large millimeter wave / sub-millimeter wave array (ALMA) is one of the highest earthquames in Earth [32]\nInfrared astronomy conducts an astronomical observation through infrared radiation, such radiation has a longer wavelength than red light, located outside the observation range of human naked eye. Infrared astronomy can be the most effective observation temperature, and it is impossible to issue a visible light, such as the planet, the star surrounding plate, and the light-shaped nebula. The wavelength of infrared radiation is more visible, so it can penetrate the dust cloud that can penetrate the visible light, which helps to study the young stars and galaxies in the depth of the molecular cloud. For example, the WAN-Dome Infrared Tour Detection Satellite (Wise) has successfully observed the original star in multiple galays and the stars in the stars. [33] [34] In addition to the infrared light of visible light, most of the infrared radiation will be absorbed by the earth atmospheric layer; the atmosphere itself also produces strong infrared radiation, further affecting observations. Therefore, the infrared observatory must be built in a low sea level, low humidity, even as a satellite to space. [35] Certain molecules have strong lines in the infrared radiation range, which helps to study the chemical composition of the celestial body, such as the water contained in the comet. [36]\n\nVisible Guang Tianxue [edit]\n The starry telescope (left) and the Kaek Observatory (middle) on the Mao Naki volcanic (middle) are observed in near infrared and visible light. NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (right) is only available in near-infrared scope.\nMain entry: Visible Guang Tianxue\nSelf arrive, human beings are visible to visible light astronomical observations with meat eyes. The earliest observations are recorded in drawing. At the end of the 19th century, people began photography of the sky. Modern astronomical photography techniques generally use digital detectors, particularly photosensitive coupling elements (CCDs). Although the wavelength range of visible light is about 4000 \u00e5 to 7000 \u00e5 (i.e., 400 nm to 700 nm), [37] However, the visible light photographic apparatus can also be used to observe a portion of the near-UV and near-infrared rays.\n\nUV astronomy [edit]\nMain entry: UV Astronomy\nUV astronomy is observed using ultraviolet radiation between 100 to 3200 \u00e5 (10 to 320 nm). Such radiation will be absorbed by the earth atmospheric layer, so observations can only be carried out in the atmosphere or space. Ultraviolet Astronomy is best suited for the study of high-temperature blue stars (OB) that launches ultraviolet rays, including blue stars other than the Galaxy system, as well as planetary nebula, super new star sites, etc. However, ultraviolet rays will be absorbed by Starcraft, so the data taken must be calibrated by other methods. [30]\n\nX-ray astronomy [edit]\nMain entry: X-ray astronomy\n X-ray jets emitted in large quality black holes, found by the US Space Delta Changdera X-ray observatory\nX-ray astronomy observes the beam in X-ray. The X-rays in the universe come from synchronous radiation (radiation emitted by electrons around the magnetic field line), the temperature of the thermal radiation emitted by the temperature above 1 million Kelvin (see the radiation) and the temperature above 1 million Kelvin Heat radiation emitted by dense gas (see black body radiation). The celestial body of the X-ray is: X-ray joint, pulse star, supernova remains, elliptical stars, galaxies and active galaxy. Since the X-ray is absorbed by the Earth atmosphere, X-ray observations must be carried out with high altitude balloons (English: high-altitude balloon, rockets or X-ray astronomical satellites. [30]\n\nGamma radio astronomy [edit]\nMain entry: Gamma radio astronomy\nGamma ray astronomy observed is the shortest radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum. Gamma rays can be observed by a satellite or atmospheric Chekenkov telescope such as the Comptton Gamma rays (English: Iact). [30] The Chekenkov telescope does not directly detect gamma rays, but the visible light generated when the atmospheric absorption gamma rays are observed. [38]\nGamma ray violent is suddenly emitting gamma rays, and duration is not equal from several milliseconds to several thousand seconds, and most gamma ray sources belong to this class. Only one formed gamma ray source is a persistent source, including pulse stars, neutron stars and active galaxies, etc. may be black holes. [30]\n\nFields that do not observe electromagnetic radiation [edit]\nIn addition to electromagnetic radiation, it is also possible to study the heaven by some other methods.\nMedium-beam astronomy utilizes the implantation of microme detectors to measure the flow of microme. Such facilities include Russian gallium experiments (English: Sage (Russian American Gallium Experiment) (Sage) (Sage) (Sage) (Sage) (Sage) (Sage) (SAGEX, Super Garanga Detector, etc. The majority of the large number of neutralizes from the Earth are from the sun, but they have also detected 24 medium inertis from the Sn 1987A supernova. [30] Cosmic rays consist of extremely high energy particles (nucleus), which decay or absorbed during entering the Earth atmosphere, producing a series of derivative particles. Today's Observatory can study the cosmic rays by detecting such particles. [39] The future of neutron detector capabilities will increase, which is expected to detect particles from cosmic rays impact atmosphere. [30]\nGravitational Wave Astronomy Research Through Observing Gravity Rod to study the distant massive celestial body, it is an emerging astronomical field. The Lei Dienity Level Availability Wave Observatory is a running gravitational wave detector, which detected the first gravitational wave in history on September 14, 2015, and the signal originates from double black holes. [40] In 2017, LIGO and room interferometers co-explored the first gravitational wave from double neutrons (GW170817). [41]\nScientists can study the same celestial body with different methods such as electromagnetic radiation, neutron and gravity waves, and this approach is called multi-message astronomy (English: Multi-Messenger Astronomy). [42] [43]\n\nNatural measurement and celestial mechanics [edit]\nMain entry: celestial measurement and celestial mechanics\n NGC 6357 stars and nebula\nAstronomy and all the oldest areas in all sciences are measurements for each celestial position. In history, the location of the day, the moon, the planet, the star, and there is an astronomical navigation and formula.\nIn the 18th century, astronomers developed a perfect gravitational perturbation theory with a precisely measured planetary location, it can exceed the past and future planetary positions extremely accurately. This discipline is called an astriodynamics. Today, scientists have a large-scale tracking of near-place, and the purpose is to predict when these celestities will slightly skirt and assess the risk of collision with Earth. [44]\nThe parallax of the surrounding stars around the solar system is the starting point of the universe distance scale. After the distance from the perspective of the parallax, the various properties of the remote star can be speculated by alignment. By measuring the radial speed and self-contrast of the star, astronomers can plot the running trajectory of the gloom in the galaxy, thereby calculating the distribution of the Silver River Dark Substance. [45]\nIn 1990, astronomers began to use Doppler spectroscopy to observe the swing of stars around the solar system. This approach can be used to find some larger lines (see the outer planet detection method). [46]\n\nTheoretical Astronomy [edit]\nMain entry: theoretical astronomy\nThe research methods of theoretical astronomers include mathematical models and numerical simulations with computers, namely physics. Mathematical models generally reveal the deeper principle behind astronomical phenomena, and numerical simulations can demonstrate the phenomenon in reality. [47] [48]\n\nSpecific branch [edit]\nSun Astronomy [edit]\n Ultraviolet images of sun balls, US Space Direction Sun Transition Zone and Rioli Detector (Trace) Space Telescope\n Slovakia Lomnitzki Mountain Sun Observatory\nMain entry: the sun\nSee: Sun Telescope\nThe sun is approximately 8 light, or the astronomical unit is the most similar to the earth, the most Focus on the star. The sun is a typical body dwarf, belongs to the G2V class, with aged 4.6 billion years. [49] Although the sun is not a star star, the number of sun particles will fluctuate up and down, and every 11 years is a solar cycle. Solar particles are regions with average temperature in the sun, generally have strong magnetic field activities. [50]\nSince the main sequence, the brightness of the sun has increased by 40%, and its brightness has a periodic fluctuation, which has great influence on the climate on the earth. [51] For example, Mondi is likely to lead to a small ice stage during the medieval period. [52]\nIn structure, the solar surface that people can see is called light balls, [53] The light ball is a thin color ball, [54] there is a thin transition layer other than the color ball, and the temperature is drastically rising, until The outermost ultra-high temperature sundes. [55] The center of the sun has extremely high temperatures and pressure, enough to produce continuous nuclear fusion. The center is a radiation layer, where the plasma here transmits energy in the form of radiation. In addition to the radiation layer, the gas is transmitted to the outer layer in the form of convection. [56] Scientists believe that the magnetic field activity generated by the rollover movement of the flow-layer gas has led to the formation of sun particles. [57]\nThe sun sprayed a large amount of plasma particles from the surface, which is the so-called solar wind. The solar wind will reach the edge of the solar system - the top of the solar layer. The solar wind will interact with the geomagnetic field (magnetic layer) when passing through the Earth, and some will be trapped in the Van Allen radiation strip surrounding the earth. When the solar wind particles enter the large gas layer of the Earth in the magnetic field, a very light is generated. [58]\n\nPlanet Science [edit]\nMain entry: Planet Science and Planet Geology\nPlanetary science research objects, in addition to planets in the sun, satellite, short planets, comets, asterities, etc., but also include sun system. The scientists first observe the celestial body in the solar system through the telescope, and then through the spacecraft, there is a good understanding of the formation and evolution of the solar system itself. [59]\n\n Photo taken in Mars. A dust tornado climbed (black point) along the meteorite pit wall, left a secret trajectory. The dust tornado is a Mars atmosphere, similar to the tornado on the earth.\nFrom the inward, the solar system can be divided into internal planets, asteroids and external planets. The inner planet includes Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, all of which are planets; the worships include Jupitar, Saturn, Dynasty Stars and Neptune, all gaseous giant planets. [60] In addition to the eight planets, there is a Cibibo and Alt Clouds that may continue 1 light year.\nThe solar planet was born in the original star discharged from 46 billion years ago. After mutual attraction, collision and reconciliation, the original line of appearance gradually accumulates large blocks, and these substances slowly evolved into original planets. Most of the discrete substances of the solar wind \"blow away\", only the planets with a large quality are to retain their atmosphere. During the next subsequent bombing period, the planet continued to be severely collissed by the surplus of the solar system. The historical sites of these collisions have traces in many impact pits on the moon. Some of these original planets also collide with each other. Scientists believe that the moon is likely to be formed in such collisions. [61]\nWhen the planet reaches a certain quality, the internal substance is separated according to different densities, which is called planetary differentiation. The result of differentiation is that the center of the planet is a stone or metal core, which can be divided into solid and liquid core, and the outer layer is a mantle and a housing. Some planetary cores can generate magnetic fields to avoid the atmosphere being peeled off from the solarish. [62]\nThe reasons for the internal temperature of the planet and satellites include: the residual heat of the planet collision, the decay of radioactive materials (uranium,, aluminum-26, etc.) and the tidal force caused by other celestities. Some of the internal heat of planets and satellites are sufficient to promote geological activities such as volcanic roles, and planets and satellites with atmospheric layers are also subject to surface erosion. If the smaller celestial body is not affected by the tide force, it will cool down faster than the big celestial body. In addition to the impact of the meteorite, the geological activity of the small corners will be based on the temperature reduction. [63]\n\nStellar Astronomy [edit]\n Ant Star Cloud. The dead stars in the center of the nebula are sprayed outwardly, and the shape is highly symmetrical, and there is a significant difference from the chaotic shape of the ordinary explosion.\nMain entry: star\nSee: Sun Astronomy\nStudying stars and stars evolution will have an important significance to understand the universe. Scientists' understanding of stars comes from observation, theory, and computer simulation on the internal interior of stars. [64] The star is formed in a high density dust and gas called a dark star cloud. When the stability of the nebula is destroyed, the dust and gas will collapse under its own gravitation to form the original star. When the density and temperature of the original star core reaches a certain degree, the nuclear fusion is activated, and the star is formed. [65]\nAlmost all of the chemical elements greater than hydrogen and helium are formed in the center of the star. [64]\nThe attribute of the star depends primarily on the quality of the start: the larger the quality, the higher the brightness, the faster the process of hydrogen in its core gathering into helium. Over time, hydrogen is completely converted to, at which time the star will enter the next stage of the evolution process. The star requires a higher temperature to make the helium. The core temperature is high enough to expand the outer layer, while increasing the core density, forming a red superstar. The red superstar will quickly use the fuel, so the life is not long. A larger quality star will gradually fracture with a heavier element, and then pass through a series of evolutionary phases. [66]\nThe quality of the star determines its final destination: the star above 8 solar quality will collapse, become a supernova, [67], and the eight solar quality, the stars below the outer layer will spray the outer layer, form the planetary nebula. [68] The wreckage after the supernova explosion is a high density of neutron stars; if the star quality exceeds 3 solar quality, the ultra-new star will be a black hole. [69] The mutual revolution will have a more complex evolutionary process, for example, the white dwarf will continue to absorb the substance from its accompanying star, and ultimately can lead to a supernova explosion. [70] Planetary nebula and supernova contribute to the \"metal elements\" generated in the internal fusion of the star (all elements in astronomy, all elements other than helium) into the interstellar medium. Standing all by both, the planet system, including the solar system, is composed of a variety of elements other than hydrogen and helium. [71]\n\nGalaxy Astronomy [edit]\n Structure of the silver rings\nMain entry: Galaxy astronomy\nThe Milky Way, where the solar system is located is a rod, and it is a member of this star group. The Milky Way is composed of gas, dust, stars, etc., these celestial celestial circulation around the center of the silver river and is bound by mutual gravity. The solar system is located on the outer side of a spiral arm of the Milky Way, so the Milky Way has a large part of the dust, and it is not easy to observe.\nThe Milky Way is a rod-shaped toner called nuclear ball. Scientists believe that there is a large-quality black hole in the top of the nuclear ball. From the nuclear balls, four main spiral arms are radiated outwards to the outer end, and the stars here are very active, including more first star stars. These structures are basically on the same plane, and there is a flat spherical silver, which mainly contains a larger second star star, containing hundreds of spherical clusters. [72]\nThe space between the stars and the stars is full of low-density substances called Star Intercoin. The molecular cloud composed of hydrogen is a region where the star is born, the density is relatively high. High-density star core or dark star clouds (critical point of collapse or not, determined by the Kings length), forming the original star. [65]\nAfter the large mass stars appear, the molecular cloud is changed to an ionized hydrogen region formed by a light-emitting gas and plasma. These stars generated stellar winds and supernova explosions eventually evacuate the clouds, often leaving a number of young evacuation stars. These stars slowly dispersed, and the stars integrate into many stars in the Milky Way. [73]\nAfter studying the movement of the Milky Way and other galaxies, scientists found that ordinary visible substances were only a small part of the total quality of the galaxies. Most of the galaxy in the dark matter of the galaxy, but the essence of the dark matter is still an unsolved mystery. [74]\n\nGalaxy astronomy [edit]\n Digital blue cyclic celestial body in the figure is a plurality of repetitive images of the same galaxy. The mass of the middle yellow galax generates a gravitational lens effect, making the light from the back of the distant galaxies, causing the effect of distorting and ghosting\nMain entry: galaxy astronomy\nResearch branches of celestial ascensities outside the Galaxy system include: the formation and evolution of galaxies, galaxy classification, survey of active galaxy and galaxies and galaxies. Observations for galaxies and galaxies are important to understand the large-scale structure of the universe.\nMost of the galaxies can be divided into screw stars, elliptical stars and irregular galaxies depending on the shape. [75]\nAs the name suggests, the cross section of the elliptical star is elliptical. The stars in the galaxies are run along the random track, not a special direction. In the elliptical star, the interstellar dust has little or completely, and the area where the star is born, the stars are generally older. The elliptical star is often seen in the center of the galaxies, which is probably the product of the big star collision.\nThe spiral galax is flat, rotated in one direction, has a raised spherical or a rod, extending a plurality of spiral arms, radioson. The spiral arm is lit, filled with dust, is the area where the stars birth, of which young quality stars are blue. The periphery of the spiral galaxy is generally halo consisting of old stars. The galaxy and neighboring fairy sears are a spiral galaxy.\nThe irregular galaxies are chaos in appearance and cannot be classified as spiral or elliptical galaxy. There are quarter galaxies in the universe belong to this class. The shape of the confusion is likely to be the result of gravitational disturbance.\nThe active galaxy will make huge energy, but these energy does not come from its stars, dust or gases, but from its dense core. Scientists believe that the oversized mass black hole in the galaxy center issues a large amount of radiation after the inhalation material, forming a active galaxy. The electric wave star is a large number of radio waves and exudes a huge gas structure of a feather or leaf shape. Other active galaxies will make a short wavelength of high energy radiation, such as the West Frax, class, and a torch. The class is a horizontal sky that is observed in the universe. [76]\nThe universe consists of the structure of the galaxies and galaxies. The largest galaxies are collectively called a super star group. The material in the universe forms a fibrous structure and the Great Wall in the maximum scale, and it is a huge void.

See also: {{Human Evolution History}} and {Life Evolution History}}\nMain entry: physical cosmology\n Hambsi\nThe study of cosmology is the entire universe. The physical cosmologist has a deep understanding of the opening and evolution of the universe by observing the large-scale structure of the universe. The core idea of \u200b\u200bmodern cosmology is the big explosive theory: the universe was born 138 billion years ago, since it continues to expand it so far. [78] [79] In 1965, scientists found that the universe microwave background radiation has laid a large explosion observation basis. [79]\nThe universe has experienced multiple development phases during expansion. Cosmists guess that the universe has initially had a fast universe, making the initial conditions of fluctuations to homogenize. Then the nuclear syndrome has produced various nuclear nucleus of the early universe (see the nuclear universe year of the year). [79]\nAt this time, the universe is filled with ions, and the photons cannot penetrate. Until the neutral atom formation, space becomes \"transparent\". For the first time, it is not blocked to penetrate the space, so far, it is still free in the universe to form a universe microwave background. It is quite a period of time, because the stars have not yet been formed, the universe is a dark. [80]\nThe material mass density of different regions has a minor difference, and the substance thus began to polymerize, forming a class structure in each scale. A substance with high density becomes a gas cloud and the earliest star - the third star star. These high-quality stars have stimulated re-ionization processes and manufactured many heavy elements in the early universe. Heavy elements become light elements after the decay, allowing the nuclear synthesis cycle to continue. [81]\nUnder the action of gravity, the substance forms a large-scale fibrous structure and huge void. Gas and dust gradually gathered to form an early galaxy. These galaxies have continuously incorporated more substances and forms a galaxies and galaxies to form a super star group. [82]\nThe presence of dark matter and dark energy has a decisive role in the structure of the universe. The two grouped, accounting for 96% of the quality of the universe. Therefore, scientists are trying to explore the physical principles behind them. [83]\n\nInterdisciplinary research [edit]\nAstronomical and Tianshi physics have close interdisciplinary relationships with other scientific fields. Archaeological Astronomy uses archeology and human evidence to study the roles and status of ancient or traditional astronomy in culture. [84] The origin, evolution, and distribution of the biological system in the universe, and special attention to the existence of the export organisms, how people can detect these lives. [85] Mechanism Statistics (English: Astrostatistics) uses statistical methods to analyze an unbeatable astronomical observation data. [86]\nThe Formation and Reaction of Chemical Substances in the Universe. [87] Cosmic Chemistry specializes in studying the distribution, sources of chemical substances in the solar system, and changes in isotope ratios. [88]\nAstronomical Identification Science (English: Forensic AstronomY) Uses astronomical knowledge, answer law, history, such as verifying the date of shooting photos or confirming the creative time of astronomical artwork.\n\nAmateur day literature [edit]\nMain entry: amateur days literature\n Amateur astronomers can build observations in their own and hold the starry banquet. Figure is located at Stellafane Astronomy Club in Vermont, USA\nAstronomy is in many scientific fields, among universal participation areas. [89]\nAmateur astronomers can observe a variety of celestial and astronomy, and some will even build observations themselves. The most popular observations include: day, month, major planets, asteroids, comets, meteor shots, stars and stars, galaxics, nebula, etc. Amateur Astronomy Club is distributed around the world, and some will provide members with a variety of help, from the construction of equipment and even 110 in the Messien Table (a total of 400) or the Herchur directory (total of 400).\nAstronomical photography is an amateur day literature Branch. Many amateur astronomers will choose to observe a certain type of celestial or a certain astronomical phenomenon. [90] [91]\nMost of the amateur astronomers are observed within visible light, but there are also a small portion of the wavelength other than visible light, including an infrared filter on a conventional astronomical telescope, or using a radio telescope. Carl Caski began to observe the wavelength of radio in the 1930s, and created amateur radio astronomy. Amateur astronomers can not only use their own equipment, but also the professional radio astronomical telescope that is open to amateur. [92] [93]\nUnlike most modern sciences, amateur is still a major contribution to astronomy. For example, they increase the measurement accuracy of the asteroid track through the mask method, discover new comets, and do regular observations on the star. With the improvement of digital technology, amatessine photography has also made great progress. [94] [95] [96]\n\nAstronomical Unknown Mystery [Edit]\nSee: Unresolved physics issues\nDespite the amazing development of astronomy, humans have changed the earth-shaped changes to the universe cognition, but there is still some important astronomical unsolved mystery today. To answer these puzzles, it is possible to need new ground or space observation instruments, and even new developments in theory and experimentation.\n\nWhere is the star quality distribution? Why is an astronomian observed the same initial quality function regardless of the initial conditions? [97] The birth process of the stars and planets is to be more in-depth.\nIs there any other living body in the universe? Is there any other wisdom? If there is, how should I solve the Fermi paradox? Confirming the existence of organisms outside the earth, there is a vital meaning of many scientific and philosophical issues. [98] [99] The solar system is flat, or there is no just?\nWhat is the essence of dark matter and dark energy? The two have decisive roles in the development of the universe, but humans are still in nature and without knowing. [100] What is the ultimate fate of the universe? [101]\nHow is the first batch of galaxies formed? [102] How is the oversized quality black hole formed? [103]\nWhere is the super high energy cosmic ray come from? [104]\nWhy is the lithium element in the universe, why is it more than four times higher than the big explosive model?

See \"Western astrology\" on common as \"constellation\".\n Frederick De Wit in the constellation map drawn in 1670\nThe constellation refers to the star combination of a group of groups. Since ancient times, humans linked the star of the three five complexes with the characters or instruments in their myth, and the integrated consisters of these hazards were \"constellation.\" The constellation is almost a means of determining the orientation of the sky in all civilizations, and it is quite wide in the area of \u200b\u200bnavigation. The division of constellation is completely artificial, and different civilizations are not the same for their division and naming. The constellation has not been unified and set, until 1930, the International Astronomical Federation is divided into 88 formal constellations in an accurate border in the exact border to make the sky in a particular constellation with the precise border. Most of these official constellations are based on the ancient Greek traditional constellation of the medieval. In contrast, there are some combinations that are widely circulated but are not recognized as a stars of official constellations, such as Beidou Qixing (see Star Recent Model).\nIn the three-dimensional universe, these stars do not have actual relationships, but they are similar to the position on the ball shell of the whole ball, and in fact, they may be far apart. If we are in another solar system in the Galaxy, we will see the stars will be completely different. Since ancient times, people are very interested in the arranging and shape of the stars, and naturally link some locations similar to the constellation.\n\ntable of Contents\n\n1 meaning and application of 1 constellation\n2 constellation origins\n\n2.1 West\n2.2 China\n2.3 India\n2.4 Arab World\n\n\n3 constellation and celestial naming\n\n3.1 Naming of ancient constellations\n3.2 Named of Modern Constellation\n3.3 Star naming\n3.4 Naming of deep space celestial body\n\n\nClassification of 4 constellations\n\n4.1 Liangxing Constellation\n4.2 Dark Cloud Constellation\n\n\n5 modern constellation evolution\n\n5.1 Ptlei Constellation\n5.2 Modern Eighty-eight Stars\n5.3 Constellations that are no longer used\n\n\n6 constellation movement and identification\n\n6.1 Sports of the constellation\n6.2 identification of the constellation\n\n\n7 constellation culture and art\n\n7.1 star chart\n7.2 Astronomical Constellation and Astrology Constellation\n\n\n8 ginseng\n9 note\n10 reference\n11 external connection\n\n11.1 overview of the constellation and its celestial body\n11.2 Observation and Identification\n\n\n\n\nSignificance and application of the constellation [edit]\n.

[Note 1] Du Fu, \"Give Guardian\"\nThe landing of stars or constellations is often used in ancient navigation and time determination. The ancient Egypt was determined by the day of the day, and the ancient technology of the azimuth of the azimuth was still saved by the ancient technology of the position of the position in some areas. [Part 1] The literary image of the constellation and its own representative also often appears in the works of literati.\nAlthough the importance of the constellation is relatively low in modern times, the constellation does not lose its charm for the night sky. Through its fascinating legend, the constellation has played an extremely important role in the popularity of astronomy. [Note 2] When a significant major sky occurs, astronomers, popular science workers and media will always set off an astronomical boom between society, especially young people. [Participation 3] [Part 10]\n\nThe origin of the constellation [edit]\n John Waves Drawing on the star map drawn in 1782, the figure is shown in the figure.\nIn order to facilitate research and observation of many stars in the sky, people divide the stars into several areas, each district is a constellation. It is difficult to say that human beings start with consciousness of constellations, such astronomical knowledge is far from being seen before there is a historical record. [Part 5] The name of the constellation is likely to source the sailor in the early navigation. [Part 6] Among the civilizations of different regions, the origin of the constellation may be completely different, but with the expansion and interaction of the civilization, the culture of the constellation also includes a fusion process.\n\nWestern [edit]\nIn the 270th BC, 47 constellations were mentioned in the \"object\" written by Greek poets [Note 3] [Part 2]. The star area recorded from the \"object\" is known that due to the difference in the year, the South Pole in the book is inconsistent with the current South Pole, according to this, it can be inferred that the book recorded in BC is 2000 before BC. Starry sky [Note 4] At the same time, the blank area recorded in the stars indicates that the observer should be nearly 35 \u00b0 to 36 \u00b0 north latitude. [Part 7] Some people think that the tricks are divided into constellations originated from the Babylonian Babylon and the Summel period, Greece and Egypt. It may be introduced from the region. [Part 8]\nIn \"Jobs\", a few constellations of Big Bear, hunter [refer to Niksi, the twelve generation, the landline, the land, the land, the land, the land, Scorpio and the Snake \" Participate 10]. The ancient Greek poet Homer and Hessea also mentioned the big bear, the hunter and the stars (at that time, the stars were seen as a separate constellation, not part of the Taurus) [Part 2] [Part 7] And Babylon in the same period has recorded the twelfth constellation with the wedge text. [11]\nTo the second century of the AD, Toller's recorded 1022 stars in 48 stars in his \"Astronomy Dacheng\", which is also the prototype of modern constellations. [Part 8] After many astronomers fill new constellations in the idle of Toller; 1603 Bay, 1690 Hevie, 1752 laci, in the past two centuries for the NANDA name. [Part 10]\n\nChina [edit]\n A Tang Dynasty in Dunhuang Mogao Grottoes, existing in the British Museum [Part 10]\nSee: Star Officer, Sanlu, Four Eagles and Twenty Eighteen\nAncient China is divided into the sky in ancient China. The earliest book is the history of Sima Qian, the official book, which recorded 91 star officials, a total of more than 500 stars [ginseng 12]. At 283 appearances in the Sui Dynasty, there have been 283 officials, which belong to one of three or twenty-eighth. Three is the three areas divided into the Arctic Sky, which is Zi Wei, Taishi and Tianshi, and is divided into four elephants next to the Huangdao and the orbic equator, four elephants will be subdivided. In seven regions, it is known as twenty-eighth. In ancient Chinese ancient times, because the moon rotates around the earth a week, it is about the month, so it is called \"booth\" or \"\" every day. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, due to the influence of the West, Xu Guangqi's \"Chongzhen Book\" referred to European astronomical data to 23 of the Nanji Star District.\nThere is different opinions on the symptoms of the stars to three \u57a3, four elephants and twenty-eighth accommodation [ginseng 13]. During the Republic of China, Ju Lu, Gao Lu, who believed in the \"Star Imposion\" in the \"Star Impation\", and then four elections, the two eighth nights [ginseng 14]. The astronomer Chen, who has served as the first curator of Beijing Tianwen Pavilion, who believes in his work earlier, and then divided into twenty-eight-bedroom, and the three is final, and points out the name of the three \u57a3 \"in the Sui Dynasty Tiange \"only, the shape of the three \u57a3 twenty-eight booths also formed in parallel with [Part 15].\nIn the early days of the week, some of the bistees of the 23rd accommodation have been found in the Spring and Autumn Warring States Period. Related to the records of the twenty-eighth and four elephants, the earliest seen in \"Historical\". The academic circles have many differences on the origin and location of the twenty-eighth. [Part 16] [Part 17] Traditionally, the beginning of China's Twenty-eight-studded system was the earliest from eight to the first sixth century BC. [Part 18] In 1978, archaeologists were painted in the tomb of the Tomb of the Tomb of Hubei Suizhou, unearthed, painted with twenty-eighth images, which was the earliest found to date about twenty-eighth cums. [Participation 19]\nThe ancient China is set to the middle official, and the twenty-eight-bedroom is actually subdivided from four elections. The two-year-old star zone is called the outer official, that is, \"Zhongguan + Four Embrand\", This is only one of the Chinese ancient China. In addition, there is also a \"five-beast + middle official + outer official\" divided into seven regions into seven regions, divided into 11 ways of \"Nine Wild [Note 5] + Middle Official + External Officials\" [Participation 20], only the \"middle official + four icon\" division is spread widely.\n\nIndia [edit]\nSee: Twenty-seven\nIndians' twenty-eighth (\u0928\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0924\u094d\u0930, Nakshatra, means \"moon station\") to China's twenty-eighth poetment, scholars believe that both the same start. [Part 21] Madler, Madler, Schlegel, Schlegel, Xincheng Xinzang and other people advocate that the twenty-eighth category originated in China; Weber, Yan John, Gold Most (KINZEL), King SMILL and EDKIN, etc. Promoting India's origin.\nDifferent from China's twenty-eight hunts, India's twenty-eighth accommodation has replaced China's twenty-eighth category, replacing the sedation in China's twenty-eighth. [Part 2] The start of the two is the end (\u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e, chitr\u0101), but the start of India's twenty-eighth accommodation is changed to Husu (\u0915\u0943\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0915\u093e, Krittik\u0101). According to the ancient classical records, rooms and walls in India, they also have a bisteland for 27 cums, or if there is also a minus weaver, they are consistent with China. [Part 23] [Part 24] The total names of the twenty-seventh place have emerged in \"Sanshan San\".\n\nArab world [edit]\n Alfelled the fairy seat.\nAfter the 9th century AD, the Ptle Magnograph was transmitted to the Arab world. Toller's work \"Astronomical Dacheng\" is translated into Arabic, named \"To Dad\". Al Sufei wrote \"Hengxing Book\" (\u0643\u0643\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0643\u0643\u0643\u0627\u0643\u0643 \u0627\u062b\u062b\u0627\u0628\u0629\u0629), one of the three masterpieces known as Islamic observation astronomy. [Part 25] Today's common star names, most names come from Arabic. [Part 26]\n\nName of the constellation and celestial body [edit]\nName of ancient constellation [edit]\nBecause the ancient civilization is relatively isolated, in different cultures, the pattern consisting of stars is given the same image. For example, Beidou Seven Stars in the ancient Greece's tail; Chinese people think that it is a pot of wine; the British think it is a plow of farming; the southern part of France believes it is a pan; Ponni Indians It is considered to be a patient on the stretcher; Maya believes that it is seven macaw; the Indian people think it is a seven wise people; the Romans are considered a seven cow. [Part 8] [Part 10]\nThe ancient China Ancient official system reflects the social system in the world, the name of the official from the emperor, the court temple, military camping, farming hunting and other aspects. This reflects the \"Heaven and Earth\" of the Ancient Culture of China and the Thought of \"Heaven and Man\". [11]\nThe names of the constellation in the Western constellation system come from the characters and animals in Greek mythology, and to Nadangji District in Greece, John Bayer is named in the sea and the biological noun from the sea and the sea. After the French astronomer Niola Louis Laki named 13 bright stars in the name of the scientific device and instrument (there is an exception \"mountain case\"). [Participation 6]\n\nModern constellation naming [edit]\n88 constellations commonly used in modern constellations Including 14 human images, 9 kinds of birds, 2 insects, 19 land animals, 10 kinds of water organisms, 2 half-horse monsters and 29 non-organisms; hair, giant snake, dragon, fly horses, rivers The sum of the species is more than one image in some constellations). [Part 8]\nThe official name of the modern constellation is used by Latin [Part 9], which spells fixed, but the pronunciation varies from person to person. [Part 27] In English, the constellation is also used in \"Latin + English\" nickname, such as South Fish, is called \"Piscis Austrinus the Southern Fish\". [Part 27] At the first Astronomical Federation of Astronomy in Rome, the Third Committee submitted a resolution of 3 letters of abbreviation symbols (such as \"PSC\", ie, Pisces), and obtained . [Part 28] [Part 2] [Part 30]\n\nStar naming [edit]\nMain entry: star naming, Bayer naming method and Franist Stellar Nomenade\nThere is no single star naming system in academic. [Part 31] The brighter star is basically based on the constellations they are, using a Bayer nomenclature or the Franist star naming method. Such as semi-horsema \u03b1 (Bayer Name Method), Swan 61 (Franist Stellar Name Method). There are also some stars to use the starry naming method, such as Tianqin Rat RR, etc. The stars that are unable to see for the naked eye, generally not naming according to their constellation unless it forms a two-star or associate system with a brighter star. These things that need to be seen through the telescope typically use their names in a particular star table.\nSome bright stars have the common names from Latin, Greece or Arabia, [Participation 31], such as \u03b1 AQL, generally referred to in English as \"Altair\", and in Chinese, \"Cowherd Star\". In fact, if you are named in accordance with the constellation, this star should be called \"Original \u03b1\" (English) or \"River Drum 2\" (Chinese). \"Tianying\" and \"river drum\" are the Western constellation and Chinese officials.\n\nNaming of deep space [edit]\nAlthough deep space celestial (nearsighted, galaxy) turns together with the measis, deep space celestial body is not commonly named. [Part 32] They generally add a letter such as M, NGC, IC before the number number, represent Messi Jexing Table, the New Year Table of the Star Cloud Star, index a star table. For significant deep spaces, there is sometimes more common names, such as M42 located in the Orion, often called the Orion nebula; M45 in ancient Chinese star is called a star stars. [Participation 33]\n\nClassification of the constellation [edit]\nThe constellation referred to in most civilizations refers to the \"bright star constellation\" composed of bright stars or some more deep spaces, but some civilization will also define \"dark cloud constellation\" through dark areas in the sky. .\n\n\u661f \u661f [edit]\nMain entry: constellation family\nModern Eighty-eight constellations can generally be simply divided into Northern Constellation, Huangdao Constellation, Nantian Constellation; sometimes it will be independent of the Equator constellation. By finding the center of each constellation, the coordinates of this point are calculated. According to the mound coordinate system, the position of each point contains two counts of red and decline. If the necklitude of the middle point is positive, that is, the point is located in the northern hemisphere of the measp. The corresponding constellation is the Northern constellation; if Naka is negative, the intermediate point is located in the south hemisphere, indicating that the corresponding constellation is Nantian constellation. These constelors can further determine their quadrants by Reduce: Time to 24 hours, the intermediate point of the constellation is from 0 to 6, and it belongs to Q1, 6 to 12 when it belongs to Q2, 12 to 18. It belongs to Q4 to 0 when it is Q3, 18. [Note 6]\nSometimes it will also be divided into the constellation in different regions. These constellation families are used in the group's most important constellation, Huang Dao, mythology, and the heavenly aquarium and create John Bayer, Nicholas Lakay. . There are 8 star families: Big Bear (10), Huang Dao (13), Yingxian (9), Wusai (17), Hunter (5), Aquarium (9), Bayer (11) and Lava (15) In parentheses are the number of modern constellations in the family. [Participation 34]\n\nCloud constellation [edit]\n Constellation defined by the dark cloud: \"\u9e38\u9e4b\" on the sky. Coal Pack The nebula forms a head, the South Crusades are here, and Scorpio is located on the left.\nWhen the conditions on the earth can make the dark spots in the central area of \u200b\u200bthe Milky Way to proceed with shadows on the ground, some cultures have seen the shape of these dark spots, and called \"dark cloud constellation\", this is different from the definition of the bright star. Constellation. The silhouette of the dark spots in the Milky Way is more obvious and easy to see in the southern hemisphere. In Inca Civilization, it is believed that dark areas or dark clubs in the Milky Way are like animals, and they are used to track seasonal replacement [Part 35]. Australian indigenous people also have a description of the dark cloud. The most famous is \"\u9e38\u9e4b in the sky\", its head is made of coal bag; in the Legend of the Ande, this dark spot constitutes a camel. [Participation 1]\n\nModern constellation change [edit]\n The constellation is actually projected from the star seen on the earth.\n50 of the modern constellations came from Ptle Magno, 12 by John Bayer named in 1603, 7 by John Hevien Named in 1690, 14 by Nicholas Lakay in 1763 name. By 1922, the International Astronomical Society decided to divide 88 constellations all day and set up the Third Committee of the Belgian astronomer Eugess Delgot (IAU Commsion 3); 1930, the International Astronomical Society officially defined The boundaries of these constelors. [Part 28] After this, any star (except for the sun), the nebula, the galaxy belongs to a particular constellation. [Part 8]\nIn modern 88 constellations, the brightest constellation is the South Cross; it can be seen that the most star of the star is half a horsepight, 6 and more the number of stars are 101; the largest constellation is a long snake seat, 1302.844 square degree, accounting for 3.158% of the sky; the smallest area of \u200b\u200bthe southern cross is only 68.447 square degrees. [Part 36] The giant snake holder is the only discontinuous constellation, which is divided by the snake seat, and the ends.\n\nPtalei constellation [edit]\nSee: Zodiac\nThe international general constellation is based on the 48 constellations contained in the \"Astronomical Dacheng\", which is the \"Astronomical Dacheng\" of the 2nd Century, which is called the Ptalei constellation. All constellations remain in modern constellations in modern constellations except that the southern sessile is separated from the southern vessel. The Ptle Magnoche mainly inherits the star table of the Greek astronomer in the 2nd century BC, which also cited the observation records of Babylon, 200 years before 700 BC. [Participation 37]\nThe Ptlei stars include 48 constellations. Among them, the twelve classical zodiac constellations are marked with light blue; the snake is until 1930, the officially confirmed Huangdao constellation.

Finally, they did not have adopted a formal constellation, a more famous one as a quadrant set (now part of the shepherd, quadrant meter meteor shower name).

The figure shows the changes in the star zone between 1,5000 - BC in 15,000 BC. Use 3D glasses (red / green or red / blue) to see better results\nThe constellation looks as the heavens is caused by the motion of the earth, which is more significant to the earth's rotation and publicity. Due to the global rotation, the starry sky is turned around the sky every day; the Star is also slowly changed with the seasonal changes. After a year, the starry sky is almost consistent with the starry sky before a year. The global rotating axis of the earth is called a long period of time, with a cycle of approximately 25,765. This motion causes the Arctic drift in the star background, which is called the year in astronomy. The rough observation of the constellation can ignore this movement within a short period of time.\nThe stars are doing high speed movement. The movement of the star can be broken down into the radial speed of the two connecting directions and the vertical self, where it will change the position of the star in the stars. Since the star distance is too far, it is generally considered that the position of the star on the sky is fixed [Note 16].\nDue to the position of the sun and the planet, the position of the globe is not fixed, they are cyclically thirteen constellations on the zodiac. In terms of accountating, it is often described in the way \"Mercury is located in Scorpio\". However, it is only twelve constellations on the astrology and is all of them.\n\nConstellation Identification [edit]\n The arch is a polar rotation around the north. Among them, the Bugou Seven Stars and the lattice of the fairy is the important symbol of the northern hemisphere to identify the starry sky.\nThe constellation is a sailor for a long time, traveler as an important sign of the identification direction. With the development of technology, the role of constellations for direction recognition is gradually weakened, but the spacecraft still determines its own position and navigation by identifying bright stars [Part 43]. For starry lovers, the recognition of the constellation is often identified for the bright star.\nIn the northern hemisphere, the Polaris of Coughing is the most important basis in the direction of the stars. As can be seen from the mound coordinate system, the height of the Arctic Star is consistent with the local latitude. However, in fact, because of the Northern Polaris is not bright, people usually use Beidou Qixing to find the Arctic Star, thereby determining the direction. You can find the Northern Polar with the scoop (\u03b2 to \u03b1) of the Beidou. In the case where the accuracy is not high, the direction of the Arctic Star is located in the north. In the low latitude area of \u200b\u200bthe Northern Hemisphere [Note 17], Beidou will fall below the horizon, at which time it can determine the position of the Arctic star according to the \"M\" (or \"W\") shaped fairy.\nOnce the Arctic Star and any other stars are identified, the entire starry sky can be identified through the relative position of the star. In order to facilitate memory, people usually look for the big corner of the shepherd seat by Beidou Seven Stars, the end of the chamber, the house, the room \u03b1). [Part 31] In different seasons, it is also possible to position significant features in other stars, such as bright hunter, light hunter, Big Oro, Little Dog, Taurus, Yushu, or Even Leo, Nautilus You can find the fairy seat, Yingxian, South Fish, etc., and the summer triangle is the most prone to the summer star air, you can find the Swan, Tianqin Rock, Tianying Station at this time. , Horses, Scorpio, Tianlong Blocks, etc.\nThe constellation near Nantian is more zero, distributed a lot of small constellations, and very small stars, many areas do not even have a brighter star, know more difficult [refers to 44]. In addition, Nantian did not have an indication star like Arctic stars, so Nantian is often extended by the Cross (South Cross \u03b3) and the Cross (South Cross \u03b1) in the South Cross (South Cross \u03b1) to determine [Note 18]. At the same time, the south gate of the semi-horsema and the half-horses alpha) and the horseshopper \u03b2), the old man of the boat (the base \u03b1), the boat of the Bojiang Radi (\u03b1 \u03b1) is identifying the Southern Hemisphere Important reference.\n\nConstellation culture and art [edit]\nStar Map [edit]\n Arch of the Orion Sad District. As can be seen from the legend, the stars are brighter, the greater the black circles indicating.\nThe star map is formed in the view position of the star or other celestial body on the mound, and information such as the orientation, brightness and morphology can be identified by the star map [Part 45]. In general, modern star charts will indicate the reference lines such as Red Territory, Ningwei, Huangdao, and the calendar used. The star map is often drawn, and the simple constellation or image is adjusted.\n\nAstronomical Constellation and Astrology Constellation [edit]\nSee: Barnam effect\nThe Twelve Star Palace of the Xiyang astronomical is a position using the \"constellation\", from the relative position of the earth and the sun, observing the interaction of the solar star operation, to divination or statistics to determine how human fate and personality have affected the study. [Note 19]\nAlthough the thirteen zodiac constellations in astronomy have a year in the middle of the middle of the spring (or the sun) [Note 20], now the astronomical constellation and the Western Astrology Starting period (the creation of the new Babylon dynasty, 626 bc) has already The difference between about 36.85 \u00b0 can be inferred that the definition of 12 constellations is earlier. Therefore, the Supreme Palace used by Western Astrology is not a year-on-year problem, which is the starting point of the first palace Aries. [Note 21] Western astrology is usually divided into two pseudo-hears, English: SideReal and Tropical Astrology, but pseudo-heraldian is only based on each of the middle gas generations.

The disciplines usually study the earth with physical, geographical, geological, meteorology, mathematics, chemistry, and biological perspective. It is closely related to human life. The gold ornaments and diamonds wearing in people are mineral resources from the earth; sand, stone, cement used in the house, also from the earth; the fish and shrimp, most Since the ocean; the changes in temperature affect the life; the operation of the celestial body is also affecting us. Therefore, earth science is a very foundation, very important discipline. Earth science is wide, covering geology, oceanography, meteorology and astronomy. Geology is to explore the history of Earth, including its evolution and distribution of various miners, rocks, and minerals; oceanography is studying seawater sports, seawater physics and chemical nature and seawatum; meteorology is analyzing atmosphere Composition, constructing, and motion; and the development of the earth, the formation of the solar system and the movement of the celestial body, the evolution of the universe, all of which are astronomical research. Taking meteorite hitting the earth as an example: high temperature and high pressure impact Earth's results, it is bound to cause changes in terrain and geology; flying dust particles in the atmosphere will obscure the sun, atmospheric and seawater temperatures. Therefore, it seems a simple astronomical event, causing changes in geology, weather, and ocean, which can be seen in various fields, and ring-ring.\n\ntable of Contents\n\n1 subject characteristics\n\n1.1 emphasizing field surveys or observations\n1.2 Time and space scale\n1.3 Pay attention to regionality\n1.4 Integration\n\n\n2 research field\n\n2.1 Earth Circle\n2.2 Types of field\n\n\n3 Earth Science Branch\n\n3.1 Geographical Science\n3.2 Geological Science\n3.3 Geochemistry\n3.4 Geophysics\n3.5 Ocean Science\n3.6 Atmospheric Science\n3.7 Space Science\n3.8 Astronomy\n3.9 Earth Biology\n3.10 system\n\n\n4 See\n5 reference\n6 external connection\n\n\nDiscipline characteristics [edit]\n Rocks also belong to the scope of Earth's science, the picture shows Nanzhu Island in Fujian, China\nEarth science has focused on field surveys, spatial space, emphasizes geographical characteristics and major integration, and is described below:\n\nEmphasize field surveys or observations [edit]\nWild surveys or observations are the primary work of the study of Earth's science, investigate the distribution of rock formations, record weather changes, observe the tide landing and observation stars, moon, solar, etc., are wild surveys.

Therefore, the field survey is the most basic work of the earth science.\nSome nature changes, the time is long, and the impact is wide. If the scholar wants to simulate the phenomenon of nature in the laboratory, it is greatly limited. So they often investigate outdoors, the time required for it is usually very long.\n\nSpatial and space scale range [edit]\nEarth science explores a wide range of spatial spaces, and the weather phenomenon between the surface is turned between, and the time unit used is small, seconds; while the goalball from the birth to the process of extinction, the time is billions of years, The scale is from seconds, points, and even hundreds of millions of years, all have an example. In electron microscopy, the distance between the atoms between the mineral crystals is preferably represented by \u00e5, but the distance between the galaxies can be much more than millions of light years. It can be seen that the range covered by the spatial scale is also ignorant.\n\nPay attention to regionality [edit]\nEarth science has a very strong geographicality, such as Taiwan because it is between the first Ocean Pacific and the world's first main land, so the weather changes multi-end. The weather in mainland China is relatively stable.\n\nIntegration [edit]\nEarth Science is a discipline of \"Shangbao Astronomy, Looks Geographical\", the land that is stepped on by people, the air breathed, and the ocean that we live is closely related to the stars, the moon, the sun, and the whole universe. Both are the objects of research. Scientists use a variety of theories to study the earth, for example, mathematics help calculate the movement trajectory of comets , The size of the movement and seismic of the gas group; physics is used to study the gravity field of the Earth, the gravity of the star, the movement or the moving movement; by chemical knowledge, the chemical composition of the rock can be analyzed; the principle of biology, Help to understand the meaning of fossils, and then establish a structure of the evolution. So the earth science is an integrated discipline.\n\nResearch field [edit]\nEarth circle [edit]\n\nEarth science is generally divided into four areas: rock circles (geo: geosphere), water circles, large air circles and biospheres; respectively correspond to rocks, water, air and life of the earth. In addition, there is also a snow ring (corresponding to ice), part of the aqueous ring; the soil circle (corresponding to the soil) is the outermost layer of the rock circle.\n\nField type [edit]\nLife evolution history check -4500 --- 4000 --- 3500 --- 3000 --- 2500 --- 2000 --- 1500 --- 1000 --- 500 --0 - Water single cell biochant action Eukaryotic biometric biometric animal mild animal dinosaur bird mammal moisture plant quilt plant primate \u2190 Earth (-4540) \u2190 Earlorate water \u2190 The earliest life \u2190 The earliest oxygen \u2190 Atmospheric oxygen \u2190 Oxyoxidation \u2190 The earliest plants \u2190 Reliable reproduction \u2190 Eddikara bio group \u2190 Han Wu Ji big outbreak \u2190 Four feet \u2190 The earliest \u733f \u733f \u751f \u5143 \u5143 \u592a \u592a \u592a \u53e4 \u53e4 \u53e4Ice can be clicked (Million Years) (see also: Human evolution history and natural evolution\nNatural geography covers geomorphology, soil learning, water literature, meteorology, climatology and biological geography [1].\nGeology mainly studies the status and evolution of the earth's crust (rock circle), main branch disciplines include mineralogics, rockology, geochemistry, geomorphology, ancient biology, formation, structural geology, engineering geology and sedimentary [2] [3].\nGeophysics and earth measuring primarily studied the shape of the Earth (English: figure of the Earth), force, and magnetic field and gravity field of the earth. Geophysicists explore the earth's intra nuclear, mantle structure, and seismic activity of rock circles [3] [4] [5]. Major branch disciplines include earth dynamics, geomagnetic, structural physics, seismology and exploration geophysics.\nSoil science covers the outermost layer (soil rings) formed by the ground shells. The main branch disciplines include soil learning and soil ecology [6].\nEcology, covering interactions between biology and natural environments. This area distinguishes planetary science in Earth Sciences and other solar systems, and Earth is the only planet that is known to have lives.\nHydrochrology and Oceanography (and Lake Mode) study the movement, distribution and quality of water in the geochenewater circle, mainly branch disciplines include ground water literature (English: Surface-Water Hydroge), hydrological meteorology (English: hydrometeorology), hydrological geology Learn [7], physics oceanography, marine chemistry (English: chemical oceanography) and marine biology.\nThe glacier is covered with ice on the earth (ice and snow ring).\nAtmospheric scientific research surface to the earth atmospheric layer between the bulk layer (higher than about 1000 km).

It is completed in 1815 and is the earliest national geological map, as well as the most accurate geological map of that era. [7]\nMain entry: Geological history\nThe study of the substance component of the Earth can be traced back to the work of the ancient Greek Thaivlastos \"PERI Lith\". During the ancient Roman Times, Old Principe described some of the commonly used minerals and metals and the correct explanation of amber source.\nSome modern scholars (such as the Philin Hudson Garrison (English: Fielding Hudson Garrison) believed that modern geology began in the medieval Islamic world. [8] Bunny is one of the earliest Muslim Geology (English: Geography In Medieval Islam), his works have the earliest story of Indian geological (English: Geology of India), proposing the Indian sub-continent once a ocean Human assumption. [9] Islamic scholars Iben West Double the formation, earthquake cause, and the topic of other modern geography give a detailed explanation, which provides the foundation for the development of future geology. [10] [11] In China, Shen Kuo (1031-1095) proposed the falseness of land formation. He saw it in a mountain from a hundred kilometers away from the ocean, in a geological formation with seashell biological fossils. As a result, he is inferred that the land is formed by the erosion of the mountains and deposition of the silt. [12]\nIt used to scattered the knowledge of geology ago. About this knowledge, such as some knowledge of metal, clay, coal and salt from the ground, have long been known for miners and related people, and natural philosophers are mostly separated from these practices, independently form their own thinkatives. Geological theory.\nGeology began to become an independent science in the 18th century and reached a mature stage in the early 19th century.\nThis period of 1790 to 1830 is called \"heroic age of geology\". During this period, people have done a lot of work in examining minerals and fossils contained in rock formations and rock formations [13] [14]. At this stage, due to the restrictions of observation, research conditions, mainly with rock circles as research objects, and relatively deeper parts under water circles, atmospheres, biospheres and rock circles, and space geology involving other planets and satellites.\n. A major progressive manifestation of the working method is classified by rock formations in accordance with the content of fossil.\nThere are three famous arguments in the history of geological schools.\nIt is a dispute between the anory and the theory of fire, which happened to the end of the 18th century. The focus of the argument is that the theory of rock formation, one party represents the German scientist Abraham Gotto Vernna, emphasizes the role of water in the rock process; the other is representative of Scotland scientists, emphasizing the role of fire. Nowadays, the rocks are mainly composed of three major categories. In addition to the deposition rocks and fires of water, there is a type of metamorite. The hydrated process and the fire have played an important role in the formation of rocks.\nIts two for disasters and gradients (also known as averaging), in the early 19th century. The scholars who have changed the change in disaster have believed that many big disasters have happened in the history of the earth, and the disaster has caused the extinction of the old species and the new species. The scholars who have gradually changed views believe that the driving force of species evolution comes from a weak geological role in the long-term accumulation of the Earth evolution, and it can also occur without relying on large disasters.\nThe third argument is the dispute between fixedness and activity. Fixed alarm said that the location of the crust is never changed, and its movement is mainly moving. Traditional ground slots, platform learning is a fixed atrial. The activity aptitude said that the movement of the crust is mainly based on horizontal movement, although the vertical movement exists, but is derived from the level of horizontal movement (such as the horizontal extrusion of the two flops). With the development of the sector structure, the theory has gradually been recognized by scholars.\n\nBranch Discipline [edit]\n Geological time sign\n.mw-parser-output .div-col {margin-top: 0.3em; Column-width: 30em; Column-count: 2} .mw-parser-output .div-col-small {font-size: 90%} .div-col-rules {color #aaa} .mw-parser-output .div-col DL, .MW-PARSER-OUTPUT.DIV-COL OL, .MW-PARSER -Output .div-col UL {margin-top: 0} .mw-parser-output .div-col li, .mw-parser-output .div-col DD {page-break-inside: Avoid; Break-inside: Avoid-column}\nBasic subjects\nmineralogy\nPetrology\nDeposit\nGeochemistry\nGeological history (English: Geology History of Earth)\nAncient biologics\nFormation\nHistorical geology\nAncient geography\nGeological age\nRegional Geology (English: Regional Geology)\nAstronomical geology\nEarth deep geology\nApplied geology\nHydrological geology\nEngineering geology\nMilitary engineering geology\nEnvironmental geology\nDisaster geology\nMetal mineral quality\nNon-metallic mineralization\nPetroleum geology\nCoal geology\nFind exploration geology\nMine Geology (English: Mining Geology)\nother\nGeophysical exploration\nGeochemical exploration\nMining engineering\nMathematical geology\nFourth Ji Ji Geology\nGlacier Geology (Ancient Glacier)\nCosmic Geology (Space Geology)\nTexture geology\nMarine geology\nSeismic geology\nVolcanic geology\nPre-cold military geology\nAgricultural geology\nDynamic geology\nExperimental geology\nField geology\nIsotope Geology (English: Isotope Geochemistry)\nMoon\nMilitary geology\nTrack geology\nStrati geology\nSubmarine geology\nSurface geology\nEngineering geology\n\nClassic books [edit]\nGeological principle (can be used as geological illustration with modern change in its biology)\nReference [edit]\nQuote [edit]\n\n\n^ Bahlburg, Heinrich; Breitkreuz, Christof.

Modern biology is a large andcompatible area, composed of many branches and branch disciplines. However, although the scope of biology is wide, some general and unified concepts have allocated all learning and research, integrating it into a single, coherent field. In general, the organism is the basic unit of life as the basic unit of life, and the gene is the genetic basic unit, and evolution is the engine of the synthesis and creation of the new species [2]. Today, people also understand that all organisms survive to consume and convert energy, regulate the in vivo environment to maintain stable and important life conditions [3]. Biology Branch Discipline is defined by the size of the biological object, and the method of studying them is defined by the method of using: biochemistry examines the basic chemistry of life; molecular biology research between biomolecular molecules; botany studies of plant biology; Biology examines the basic components of all life, cells; physiological examination, organs, and organisms of organs of organizers, organs of organisms, physics and chemical function; evolutionary biology investigated the diversity of life; and ecology How to interact in its environment. In the end, it is possible to achieve the treatment of genetic diseases, improve crop yield, improve human life, protect the environment.

In 1802, the French Museum La Mark raised this noun.\n\nModern biology foundation [edit]\nThe five foundations of modern biology are also the main research direction: [7]\n\nCytology [edit]\n The nucleus of human cancer cells is dyed in blue (especially DNA). The cells in the center and the right are in the interval, so the entire cell nuclear is marked. The cells on the left are undergoing mitosis and its DNA is agglomerated.\nMain entry: Cytology\nCytology said that cells are the basic unit of organisms, and all organisms are composed of one to a plurality of cells and cell secretion (eg, external skeleton). All cells were produced by other cells by cell division. The multi-cell organism starts from a single cell from a fertilized egg, and then gradually divides into individual cells, and the cells are also a basic unit of the pathology (English: pathological process). [8]. In addition, the phenomenon of energy transfer between cells is referred to as metabolism, and the cells contain genetic information (DNA), which are also transmitted to other cells during cell division.\n\nEvolution [edit]\nMain entry: evolution\nModern biology believes that life is evolved, all known creatures have a common origin. Evolution Theory is assumed that all earth-lived and extinct creatures come from a common origin or one Gene data bank. All creatures of all the best in the world appear in about 35 billion years ago [9].\nAt present, there is an evolution of evolutionary evidence, and the academic community generally believes that evolution is the fact, not just theory or hypothesis, and there is a strong scientific consensus, anything other than the species or humans outside the evolution. The origin of the origin is not supported. The vast majority of scientific community and academic groups believe that the evolution is the only theory that can fully meet the phenomenon observed in biology, ancient biological, molecular biology, genetics, anthropology, and other fields. [10] [11] [12] [13] A Gale Pusher in 1991 shows that only about 5% of scientists (including other scientists other than the biology field) think that they are creators. . [15] [16] As of now, there is no discussion on evolutionary papers, and the scientific and medical period search engine PubMed is ranked. [17]\n\nGenetics [edit]\n The side of the side depicts the hybrid cross between 2 pea plants and the hybrid cross between white flowers (b).\nMain entry: Genetics\nThe gene is a basic unit of biometric genetics, and the gene corresponds to a specific region of DNA, which affects a certain part or a certain one of the organisms in a particular manner. All organisms from bacteria to animals have the ability to replicate DNA, and the ability to produce protein. Cells transcribed the gene of DNA into corresponding ribonucleic acid (RNA), and then ribosome translated RNA into a string of proteins consisting of amine acid. Genetic passwords converted from RNA to amine acids are the same in most organisms, but some organisms still have a little difference. For example, if the human corresponding insulin DNA is placed in plants, insulin [18] can also be produced.\n\nIn vivo balance [edit]\n The hormones in many endocrine systems are controlled by the negative feedback system, such as the sugar corticoids secreted by the adrenal adrenal. Under-sustaining Promotel Adrenal Prostatin Releases (CRH), CRH will secrete adenpropine (ACTH), while ACTH can secrete glucocorticoids such as cortisol. Glucocorticoids not only make the body have corresponding reactions, but also reduced the secretion of the lower-looking and brain pituitary, so as long as the glucocorticoid has reached a certain amount, it will not continue secretion. [19]\nMain entry: Balance in vivo\nIn vivo balance: Balance is an open system that can be adjusted by many dynamic balanced dynamic balanced dynamic balance, so that its inherent situation is maintained in a stable state. All organisms, whether single cells or multi-cell organisms, have a balanced mechanism [20].\n\nOne system is to maintain dynamic balance, and effectively adjust, requires ability to detect disturbances and respond to disturbances. After detecting disturbances, the biological system will generally respond to a negatively controlled manner. That is, by adjusting the conditions of the system, try to reduce the influence of disturbances. As if the blood glucose concentration in the animal is too low, it will release glucagon to increase blood glucose [21].\nEnergy [edit]\nA live organism is dependent on the continuous input of energy. The organisms are chemically reacted to extract energy from the food to maintain physical functions and establish new cells. In the above reaction, molecules that form food chemicals play two important roles. First, some of these molecules can produce energy by chemical reactions in the biology. Second, some can form a new molecular structure in the biomolecule.\nBiomery responsible for introducing energy into the ecosystem is called producers or self-nutrient organisms. Almost all these organisms were originally drawn from the sun. [twenty two]\n\nResearch overview [edit]\nBiologists have a lot of research, so there are many research fields. E.g:\n\nOf atomic and molecules: molecular biology, biochemistry, structural biology.\nCellular: cell biology, microbiology, viral.\nMulti-cells: physiology, developmental biology, histology.\nMacroous: ecology, evolutionary biology.\nBiology itself has continued to develop rapidly, and more and more related integration with other disciplines. A major reason is that molecular biology is in modern times, and finally leads to the order of human gene sequences to complete [23]. Thus, in order to interpret the huge number of gene information, genomics have been promoted. In order to explore the interaction of genes and proteins, a proteomic solution [24] is created. These new research areas help solve problems such as diseases, food, environmental ecology. Its research information and accumulation of massive research data require new computer algorithms to process [25].\n\nStructure [edit]\nBasic structure of cell biological animal cell animal cells:\nNuclear benevolence\nNuclear nuclear\nRibosome\nVesicle\nRough endometric network\nGolgi\nCytoskeleton\nLight surface\nMitochondrial\nSputum\nCytoplasmic matrix\nDissolution\nThe central body\nCell membrane\n\nMain entry: molecular biology, cell biology, genetics and developmental biology\nMolecular biology is a biological study of molecular levels [26]. Other fields of biology overlap, especially genetics and biochemistry. Molecular biology focuses on understanding the interaction between various systems within a cell [27], including DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis and learning these interactions [28].\nCell biological studies of cell structure and physiological properties, including their behavior, interaction, and environments.\nAnatomy is in the form of a macroscopic structure, such as organ and organ system [29].\nGenetics is scientific with mutation of genes, genetic and organisms [30] [31].\n\nPhysiology [edit]\nMain entry: physiology and anatomy\nEvolution [edit]\nMain entry: Evolutional biology, evolution, social biology, nature selection and modern comprehensive theory\nClassification and naming [edit]\nMain entry: biological classification\nCategory: Biology to species classification, from top to 8 levels. Any species also has its location and name at these 8 levels.\nThey are regio, a relationship (RegN), Divisio or PHYLUM, ClassIS, (ORDO), Branch (SPECIES), SPECIES [32].\n\nName: All species have their own unique students, globally recognized (except for academic classification disputes), not due to regional or countries.\nDouble list is a named method, English is binomial nomenclature. It gives each species two words, the preammers are the genus name, and the post is its kind of small name (species, and the two are called. In addition to the first letter, the rest of the letters should be lowercase. Latin is generally used, or in other language words, add the latin hybrid suffix. For example, China has recently discovered the dinosaur, some scientific names are done in Chinese Pinyin.\nSome species must be subsequently divided into subspecies because of the environmental isolation or mutation. In order to facilitate the difference, the scientific community gave a set of three laws in the subcommination design, English is Trinomial Nomenclature.\n\nEcology and environment [edit]\nMain entry: ecology, animal behavior, behavior and biological geography\nScientific study of the relationship between biology and its environment [33]. The environment includes biological environment and non-biological environments, and the biological environment refers to the relationship between biological species and interior of the species. Non-biological environments include natural conditions: soil, rock, water, air, temperature, humidity, etc. [34].\n\nResearch method [edit]\nBiologists often use observations and experimental methods for the study of life phenomena, usually in both ways.\n\nIt is observed that the physical properties of the organism will be described. It is usually observed and described in the first shape and behavior, and then observes the organism anatomy by means of the optical instrument. Observing is a variety of, some observations are also observed; static observations also have dynamic observations; there are different kinds of comparative observations.\nThe experiment is that people have changed some conditions to observe the changes and reactions of organisms, to explore the internal causal relationship between life, and is a method of understanding life activities.\nThe experimental method is human intervention, controlling the object being studied, and the effects of the subject have been studied by this intervention and control. In the 17th century, the earliest biology experiment has emerged, such as the British physiologist William Harvei on the blood circulation, Yang Boptista Fan Haiermont's experiment of the willow growth. In the 19th century, physics, chemistry is mature, biological experiments have a solid foundation, and thus the first is physiology, then bacterial and biochemistry have become a clear experimental discipline. In the 1980s, the experimental method was further applied to disciplines such as embryory, cytology and genetics.\n\nSystem method: System science originates from the original theory, the mechanical theory, the proposed organism, comprehensive philosophy, from Klod Bernard and Walter Braford Caman (English: Walter Bradford Cannon) reveals the organism Steady state, Nobet Vaja and William Ross Aisby (English: William Ross Ashby) Control Theory of Carl Ludwig von Belta Lang's general system, the earliest established Systematic psychology, systematic ecology, system physiology, etc. have established and developed, and systematicism and biology, system biology, etc. in the 1970-180s were published. From the information of Claude Shannon to the dissipative structure theory of Iria Primei, regarding life as a self-organizing system. Cell biology, biology and molecular biology development, Manfred Agang propose cells, molecular levels to explore the supercircum (English: hypercycle (chemistry)) theory.\nUnresolved biology basic problem [edit]\nMain entry: Unresolved biological problems\nAlthough we have made profound progress in the understanding of the basic process of life in recent decades, some basic problems still have not been resolved. For example, one of the mainly unresolved issues of biology is gender main adaptive functions, and especially in eukaryotic organisms, its key process, decay split and homologous recombination. One point of view believes that gender is mainly developing into an adaptation to increase genetic diversity (see Resources, such as [35] [36]). Another point of view is that sex is an adaptive DNA repair to germ cell line DNA promotes accurate DNA repair, and increase genetic diversity is mainly possible to see a useful product from the long run. [37] (See Severed Reproductive Evolution).\nAnother basic unresolved problem in biology is an aging biological basis. Currently, there is no fundamental reason for aging. The theory of various competition in aging # aging theory [39].\n\nBiology major branch [edit]\nThese are the main branches of biology [40] [41]:\n\nZoology: Animal physiology, anatomy, embryology, neurobiology, developmental biology, insect, animal behavior, histology.\nBotany: Simple learning door classification can be divided into [42]:\nApplication Body: Agriculture (or agronomy), gardening, flowers, plant breeding, forest, plant pathology, etc.\nPure science (botany): Plant classification, plant physiology, plant morphology, plant anatomy, plant geography, genetics, ecology, algae, etc.\nMicrobiology, Medical and Immunology: Microbiology, Immunology, Hematology, bacteriology, virological, infectious diseases, toxicology, radiology, cancer biology.\nBiochemistry areas: biochemistry, protein mechanics, sugar, lipid chemistry, metabolic chemistry.\nEvolution and Ecology: Ancient biological study, evolution, evolutionary biology, social biology, classification, systematic taxonomy, ecology, biological distribution.\nModern biotechnology sectors: biotechnology, genetic engineering, enzyme engineering, bioengineering, metabolic engineering, genetic physics, synthetic biology.\nCells and molecular biology: cytology, molecular biology, genetics, epigenetic genetics, neurobiology.\nBiological and physics areas: biophysics, structural biology, anticipation optics, medical engineering.\nBiological and information areas: biomarology, biological information, system biology.\nEnvironmental and biological areas: Atmospheric Biology, Biological Geography, Marine Biology, Freshwater Biology, Earth Biology.\nAtlas [edit]\n\n\n\n\nAnimals - BOS Primigenius Taurus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlant - normal wheat (Triticum)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFungi - sheep bacterium\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStramenopila / algae - brown algae\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBacteria - Gemmatimonas Aurantiaca (- = 1 \u03bcm)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBacteria - thoria\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirus-gamma phage\n\n\n\n\nReference [edit]\nQuote [edit]\n\n\n^ Aquarena Wetlands Project Glossary of Terms.

The narrow medical treatment is only the treatment of disease, but it also says that prevent medicine is the first medicine, clinical medicine is the second medicine, rehabilitation medicine is the third medicine. The science of medicine is the theory and discovery of basic medicine, such as biochemistry, physiology, microbiology, anatomical, pathological, pharmacology, statistical, epidemiology, nutrition, etc. to treat disease and promotion. However, medicine also has a side of humanities and art, but it is concerned not only the human organs and disease, but is health and life. \"Physiology - Psychology - Social Mode\" is a widely accepted theory, and other \"care of physiological psychological spiritual society\", \"all people, whole team, full, family medical\" is also an important theory of modern medicine. With the transformation of medical model, medical humanities have received more and more attention. Medical ethics is the most widely known one is the four-first principle methodology: \"Independent, good, not harm, justice\".\nIn human society, medicine has already had thousands of years. Modern medicine originated in Europe after the 17th-century scientific revolution, with scientific processes and methods for medical treatment, research and verification. The large direction of the research is included in basic medicine, clinical medicine, inspection medicine, preventive medicine, health medicine, rehabilitation medicine, etc. Medicine developed before modern medicine, known as traditional medicine; traditional medicine continues to exist in the form of alternative medicine in modern medicine, or research in modern medical science methods.\nModern medicine is based on natural science, making scientific analysis and clinical analysis of pathology, pharmacology, epidemiology, etc. of life and physical changes. The development of modern medicine has benefited from the achievements of industrial civilization and effective use of scientific and technological development, which makes it enriched in the research and application of testing, medical and surgery. Modern medicine in surgery, organ transplantation, epidemic control, vaccine and immunization, gene and stem cell research, animal experiment, new drug development and medical engineering, etc., there is an important impact in contemporary human health and per capita life [3].\n\ntable of Contents\n\n1 words\n2 medical history\n3 branch\n\n3.1 Basic Science\n\n\n4 education\n\n4.1 USA and Canada\n4.2 British Federal Area\n4.3 China\n4.4 Japan\n4.5 Argentina\n\n\n5 modern medical challenge\n6 ethics\n7 See\n8 reference\n9 extension reading\n10 external connection\n\n\nResignation [edit]\nThe explanation of the word \"doctor\" in \"Say Wen\" is: \"Governance and doctors are also. \u6bb9, viciousness; the doctor is native.

(October 21, 2013)\n Doctor is treating patient, Paris, France.\nMain entry: medical history\nIn most cultures, the earliest medicine is to use some experience to prove effective substances, such as some plants (herbs), animal medicines and minerals.\nThe latter people constantly add-to-death on the basis of this medical book, gradually forming the later \"Yellow Emperor's Internal Classics\" and \"Yellow Emperor\", and I wish you a pure medical medicine to form later Chinese medicine. . The \"Yellow Emperor's Internal Classics\" proposed a preventive medical care for the disease and health care in the disease.\nThere are some knowledge of medicine and dental health in the Harda River Basin during the Harda (3300 BC).\nIn ancient Egypt, people have recorded many medical literatures, such as Kahun paper text (2000-800 BC), Smith paper (1700 BC) and Ebers (eBers) paper Grass Wen (1500 BC). Among them, Smith paper recorded the spasm and meningums caused by the brain, which is the first record of the brain in the world [5]. The medical records of Cuba Babylon civilization can be traced back to 2000 BC.\nSince William Harvey, the blood circulation theory is marked as the beginning of modern medicine. Today, there are many new technological methods that have been continuously added to the medicine and produce biomedical engineering, medical imaging, nano-medicinal branches.\n\nBranch [edit]\n Modern hospital internal equipment\nMedical branches include:\n\nMedical basic science\nMedical specialist\nInterdisciplinary field\nBasic science [edit]\nAnatomy is the study of biomerics, which is the opposite of cell biology and histology, and is a microstructure of research objects.\nBiochemical study chemistry, especially the structure and function of chemicals in biology.\nStudy on the structure and function of biomechanics in the perspective of biomechanical mechanics.\nBiometric statistics is to apply statistical applications in the biological field. In planning, evaluation, and interpretation of medical research, there is a need for biological statistics. Biometric statistics are also the foundation of epidemiology and empirical medicine.\nBiological physics uses physical and physicochemistry to study biological systems.\nCell biological studies of biological cells.\n Louis Bastide and his laboratory\nDevelopment and formation of embryonic research organs.\nEndocrine study of hormones and their effects on the body.\nThe population statistics of the disease process of epidemiology, including epidemic research, and research on other diseases.\nGenetics study genes and their roles in the genetic.\nOrganizations using microscopy, electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry.\nImmunology research immune system, including the immune system of congenital and late days.\nMedical physics is to apply physical law in medicine.\nMicrobiology is a research on microbial, including native animals, bacteria, fungi and viruses.\nMolecular biology is a molecular related study on genetic replication, transcription, and translation.\nNeuroscience is the science related to the nervous system. It is mainly biological and physiology of the brain and spinal cord. Some relevant clinical specialists include neurological, neurosurgery and psychiatry.\nNutrition is the effect of studying diet on health and disease and decides the most appropriate diet. The hospital's nutrient treatment is carried out by the nutritionist.

Students who intend to report must first take the bachelor's course, unlimited field, but the scientific category is recommended (because such students can prove that they have certain scientific knowledge before reading medicine). During the first undergraduate course, students also need to complete a series of medicine, the United States called \"Pre-Health Science Course\" and completed and passed the course test. Apply for the course of medical schools. The application process is also relatively comparable, self-recommended letter and recommended letter averaging. [6] After completing the course and passing the local medical practice exam, it can formally become a doctor and can continue to promote the selection of specialist and master's degree and doctoral degree.\n\nBritish Federal Area [edit]\nIn these areas, medicine is open to high school graduates. Students participate in local college entrance examination after graduating from high school, and can apply for medical school courses after all conditions. The medical undergraduate course in these areas is generally five years to six years. After obtaining the academic academic degree in the internal and foreign academic degree, it is necessary to work in the hospital for one year, and can continue to promote the selection of specialists and the master's degree and doctoral degree.\n\nChina [edit]\nThe Song Dynasty, Song Yuanjia, 20th Years (443), Tai Medical Due to Qin Chengzu created related medical education institutions, the earliest medical school in human history [7]. In the 6th century AD, Sui Dynasty improved the medical education institution, and named the \"Tai Medical Department\", the department is divided into medical, the medicine is two, the doctor's order is the highest official position, the assistant, the subject, the doctor, medicine Garden, Ph.D. True, Dr. Massage, Wishing Dr. Ban, at most than 580 people in school teachers in school [7].\nIn the first year of the Datong (947), the Liao Jun entered, \"\u5bc5, Jin Zhuang, \u5ad4 \u5ad4, \u5ba6 \u5ba6, square skill, hundred work, illustration, illustration, stone, copper, Ming Tang, Too Changle spectrum, Zhanterong County, halogen books, rules and armors, and I will send it to Beijing [8]. \"In the beginning, Khitan doctor was in full care, and the life of the translation of the party was in the book. It is all the people to practice, although the people also know the medical treatment.\" In order to learn Han Medical, Liaoning Zong people translators \" The book \"book and brings medical development in Liao Dynasty [9]. There is no clear record of the establishment of official medical education institutions in the historical book of the Liao Dynasty. [10].\nIn 1894, Li Hongzhang played to Tianjin General Hospital to attach Western Medical Tang (also known as Beiyang Medical Tang), which is China's earliest Western medicine school [11]. Early China's medical academic system is mainly to copy Japanese models, and hire teachers from Japan, the construction industry is 4 years, and the university undergraduate level [11]. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, a large number of Chinese students went to Japan. In 1902, 3 of 272 international students in Japan were studying medicine [12]. In 1903, the Beijing University of Science and Technology, \"Selecting Students Outdoor, Dear Specializing in the Choice of Hearing\", and there are 1 people in 31 people in Japan [12]. In 1904, the number of medical students reached 23 people in the school [12].\nIn 1912, Cai Yuanpei, the Temporary Government Education of the Republic of China, promulgated \"university order\", one of the 7 points of medical department as part of the medical department as a text, reason, law, merchants, agriculture, and effort [11]. 103 subjects of medical curriculums, is the largest number of courses, and the construction period is the preparatory age for 3 years, university 4 years. In 1917, the Ministry of Education of the Northern Government issued the \"Amendment of University Order\", which stipulates that there are universities in the two sections, and the establishment of one of the five sections of law, medical, agriculture, work, and merchants, etc., such as medical department. the University. In 1922, the Ministry of Education of the Northern Government issued a \"new school system\" in the United States to learn from the United States. The medical practice of medical preparation and medical specialist is 3 years. Medical undergraduate construction is 5 years. In 1935, the Ministry of National Government issued the \"Interim Subject Table of Medicine\" and made a unified requirement for the academic and curriculum systems in medical institutions. In 1941, it was changed to 6 years of medical undergraduate industry and stipulated two phased exams after the course of a specific academic year. This system has been used as the founding of the People's Republic of China.\nIn October 1951, the Administration of the People's Republic of China promulgated the \"Decision on Reform\", and began to develop a large number of medical practitioners in the three-year-old medical system in the preserved six-year sectic system [11]. In 1955, the medical specialist and undergraduate professional construction is unified to 3 years, 5 years, and directly cultivated high school graduates, short school education and cultivation becomes a special talent with application-oriented medical and health technology. From 1988, China The Ministry of Education of the People's Republic officially begins to trial seven-year clinical medical profession. In 1997, the State Council's degree committee approved the implementation of clinical medical professionals. In 1998, the Ministry of Education and the State Council of the State Council will re-positioned the seven-year medical education training target in the Master of Clinical Medicine. By 1998, medical professionally adjusted to 8 major categories of 16 majors, learned from three, four, five, six, seven, and eight-year-old.\nAccording to the definition of the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, the level of medical, basic medicine, clinical medicine, stomatics, public health and preventive medicine, Chinese medicine, Chinese and Western medicine, pharmacy, Chinese medicine, special medicine, medical technology ( Can teach Medics, Science degree, nursing.\n\nJapan [edit]\nIn 1876, Japan followed the European countries, such as Germany, the United Kingdom, established the National Institute of Medicine, Medical University and Medical College, headed by the Imperial University [13]. Beginning in 1945, it was adjusted by the United States, Japan adjusted the original 50 medical schools (including the university affiliated specialist ministry). In 1950, the old universities and upgraded schools were changed to Xinchui University Medical College and 46 Medical University, and significantly cut the number of enrollment. During this period (1946), no matter the new system, it is 8 years of the old medical institution. From 1970, Japanese medical colleges have developed rapidly and reached 80 in 1981 (National 43, public 8, private 29) [13].\n\nArgentina [edit]\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, Argentina created the first medical school, including the University of Buenos Aires Aires Alex, China and 1877 University Medical College [14]. In 1958, the University School of Medicine, Salvador, and two private medical schools in Cordova Catholic College.\nArgentina has a total of 29 medical schools, 10 of which are located in Buenos Aires, the capital, and other largest cities in the internal province [14]. The course settings in all medical schools are six years, including three-year basic discipline study, two-year clinical discipline learning and one-year internship, a slight difference between the schools in the form of specific implementation. Since 2000, Argentina's medical schools need to pass the National University Evaluation and Certified Certification Certification. The full-time teachers in the Medical College are most basic subject researchers, which are subject to other national sectors under the National Science and Technology Research Committee (CONICET) or government management.\n\nModern medicine challenge [edit]\nMany confirmed diseases such as aging, death, AIDS and cancer are still the challenge of the medical community [15] [16].\n\nEthics [edit]\nMedical ethics is some moral principles that need to be observed in medical work. Medical ethics include clinical applications, as well as their history and their philosophies and sociology. The most widely known is the four basic principles: \"Independent, Good Good, Do Not Harness, Justice\" [17]. The following is the six principles of contemporary medical ethics [18]:\n\nAutonomous: The patient has the right to refuse medical or choose its medical approach.\nGood (English: Beneficnce (Ethics): Doctors should pay attention to the best interests of the patient.\nJustice (English: Justice (Ethics)): Focus on the distribution of rare medical resources, and fair allocation resources.\nDo not harm (English: primum non nocere): Try to minimize unnecessary harm of medical processes.\nIntegrity: After the Taski Medicinal Test and Second War of the United States, after the trial of the twelve German physicians (English: doctors' Trial), the informed consent (in knowing the agreement decisions after all facts) The concept is increasingly valued.\nConfidentiality: There is a confidential responsibility for the patient's condition.\nThe moral principles described above are not used to process the processing method in a particular situation, but provide an available architecture for some contradictions in medical treatment. Sometimes two moral principles may conflict, and the results may be two difficulties in morality (English: Dilemma) or crisis. Sometimes the two difficulties in medical ethics have no good treatment, sometimes medical groups (hospitals and medical staff) values \u200b\u200band patients, patients with patients, and even most non-medical groups have conflicts. Sometimes there may be a valuable conflict between medical service providers or between the patient's families. For example, when the patient refuses to accept blood transfusion, the autonomous and good-ended ethics has conflict. Before there is Ai Dynasty, the general processing method is priority, regardless of whether or not to tell the truth.\n\nSee [edit]\nVeterinary Science\nPrognosis\nDisease list\nmedical instruments\nPatient safety\nReference [edit]\n\n\n^ Oxford English Dictionary (Page Archive Backup, Save Internet Archive) Definition of \"Medicine\"\n\n^ Modern Chinese Dictionary (7th Edition).

Pharmacology is mainly scientific research in biomedical, and pharmacy mainly uses pharmacological knowledge to provide patients with higher quality medical treatment and services. The former is a scientific research, the latter is clinical. In addition, the concept of pharmacy and pharmaceutics is often confused. Pharmaceuticals are a branch of pharmacy, only to study some of the pharmaceutical part, and pharmacy itself is a clinical practice of various medical knowledge. In some areas (such as Hong Kong), the word \"pharmacy\" in Chinese is usually referred to as \"pharmacy\".\nAt present, the meaning of pharmacy includes pharmacy science, pharmaceutical occupation, pharmacy, etc.\nPharmaceutical main study of drugs, artillery, traits, role, analysis, identification, deployment, production, storage, and search (including synthetic) new drugs. The main task is to continuously provide more effective drugs and improve the quality of drugs, ensure the safety of medication, and treat or cure the patient with the smallest injury and maximum.\n\nSee [edit]\n\n\nPharmacological theme\nMedical theme\nPharmacist\nmedicine\nPharmaceutical\nExternal link [edit]\n\n\n\nWiki Shared Resources related multimedia resources: pharmacy\nCheck the branch of biomolecularly organized bio molecules \u00b7 Inorganic compound list \u00b7 Organic compound list \u00b7 Element cycle table Physical chemistry\nElectrochemical\nThermochemistry\nChemical thermodynamics\nColloidal chemistry\nSurface science\nSpectroscopy\nStructural chemistry / crystallography\nChemical physics\nChemical kinetics\nFlying second chemistry\nQuantum Chemistry\nPhotochemistry\nNuclear chemistry\nOrganic chemistry\nBiochemistry\nBiological organic chemistry\nChemical born\nClinical chemistry\nNeurochemistry\nBiological physics\nmolecular biology\nStereochemistry\nPhysical organic chemistry\nOrganic reaction\nInverse analysis\nAsymmetric synthesis\nFull synthesis / semi-synthesis\nPharmaceutical chemistry\nFullere chemistry\nhigh polymer chemistry\nPetrochemistry\ninorganic chemistry\nCoordination Chemistry\nMagnetochemistry\nOrganic metal chemistry\nBiological inorganic chemistry\nBiological organic metal chemistry\nAtomic typical chemistry\nCrystallography\nSolid chemistry\nMetallurgy\nmaterial science\nanalytical chemistry\nInstrumental Analysis\nElectrochemical analysis\nSpectrum method\nIR\nRaman\nUV-VIS\nNMR\nMass spectrometry\nEI\nICP\nMaldi\nChromatography\nGC\nHPLC\nFlying second chemistry\nCrystallography\nCharacterize\nOther chemistry\nNuclear chemistry\nChemistry\nRadiochemistry\nRadiochemistry\nNatural chemistry / cosmic chemistry\nGeochemistry\nEnvironmental Chemistry\nAtmospheric chemistry\nMarine Chemistry (English: Ocean Chemistry)\nCoal chemistry\nPetrochemistry\nFood chemistry\nAgricultural chemistry\nChemical education\nForensic Chemistry (English: Forensic Chemistry)\nNanochemistry\nSlemnacochemistry\nChemical synthesis\ngreen Chemistry\nClick to chemistry\nCombination chemistry\nCalculation chemistry\nTheoretical chemistry\nWet chemistry\nSee\nChemistry history\nChemical year\nElement discovery history\nNobel Chemistry Award\nCentral Science\nchemical reaction\ncatalytic\nchemical element\nCompound\natom\nmolecular\nion\nChemical bond\n\nChemistry classification\nChemical theme\n Share resource\n Topic\n\nCheck the drug metabolic mechanics\nAdme: ADME: Absorption (English: Absorption (Pharmacokinetics))\nDistribution (English: Distribution (Pharmacology))\nmetabolism\nExclusion (Clear Rate (English: Clearance (Pharmacology)))\nLoad dose (English: loading dose)\nDistributed volume (initial (English: Initial Volume Of Distribution)\nFusion rate (English: rate of infusion)\nCompartment (English: Compartment (Pharmacokinetics))\nBiological equivalent (English: bioequivalence)\nbioavailability\nEffect (English: OnSet of Action)\nBihypertension\nPlasma protein binding\nTasty Time (LD50, ED50 (English: Effective Dose (Pharmacology), TD50)\nTreatment index\nPharmacodynamics\nToxicity (neurotoxicity)\nDose - reaction relationship (English: dose-response rateship) (effectiveness, titer strength)\nAnti-microbial drug effect (English: antimicrobial pharmacodynamics): minimum antibacterial concentration\nAntibacterial drug\nMinimum bactericidal concentration (English: minimum bactericidal concessration)\nSterilization\nExcited and antagonism\nActuator: anti-agonist\nIrreversible\nPart of an agonist\nSuper agonist\nPhysiological agonist (English: Physiology Agonism and Antagonism)\nAntagonist: Competitive antagonist\nInverse antagonist\nPhysiological antagonist (English: Physiology Agonism and antagonism)\nOther: Combination (English: molecular binding)\nAffinity\nBinding selectivity (English: binding selection)\nFeatures Selective (English: functional selection)\nother\nDrug resistance: Quick tolerance (English: tachyphylaxis)\nDrugability: antibiotic resistance\nMulti-drug resistance (English: Multiple Drug Resistance)\nRelated fields / subsembling\nGenetic Pharmacology (English: Pharmacogenetics)\nPharmaceutical genomics\nNeuropathics (English: Neuropsychopharmacology) (Neuropharmacology (English: Neuropharmacology), Psychotyma (English: Psychopharmacology)\n\nSpecification control\nAAT: 300054520\nGnd: 4045705-9\nLCCN: SH85100603\nNDL: 00574198\n\nThis is a small work related to pharmacy.

He published in 1948, \"Life Problem\", a general sign system, general sign system. Betarangfi proposed the open system theory of biological development, and established the first river for the theory of biological evolution.\nFor life and non-life, the average person has an intuitive feeling of distinguishing between them. The former is an open system that requires constant and environmental exchange energy and information, while the latter's stability needs and environmental isolation, the can maintain its independence, such as pure oxygen, once released into the air, immediately mixed with other gases. Therefore, there is a significant difference in life and non-life. The concept of thermodynamic physicist Buri Province proposes negative entropy corresponding information, information disciating the metrics, the Austrian theory physicist Schr\u00f6dinger \"What is life? - Physical concept of live cells \"propose the negative entropy principle of life, Puli Gaojin proposes the self-organizing theory of energy dissipation structure from physics, thereby architectural bridges of physics and biology.\n\nEurope and the United States [edit]\nOu Wen Razlo and Budapest Club issued a generalized evolutionary theory and established magazines such as \"Generalized Evolution\", \"General Evolutionary Theory Research\", thus establishing a universal system self-organizing theory system.

In Western languages, the cryptography is derived from Greek Krypt\u00f3s \"hidden\" and written with Gr\u00e1phein. Classical cryptography main attention information confidential and written, and corresponding to its corresponding deciphering method. Modern cryptography does not focus on information confidentiality, while also involving information integrity verification (message verification code), unrecognizable sex (digital signature), and attacks generated from internal and external in distributed calculations All information security issues. The important difference between classical cryptography and modern cryptography is that classical cryptography and decipherment usually rely on the creation of designers and hostile creativity and techniques. As a practical art, there is no clear definition of password. Modern cryptography originated in a large number of related theories in the late 20th century, which made modern cryptography have become a science that can be rigorously learned.\nCryptography is the branch of mathematics and computer science, and its principle has a large number of information theory. The famous cipher Scholar Ronald Lee Vistone explained: \"The cryptography is about how to communicate in the environment in which the enemy is present,\" from the perspective of engineering, this is equivalent to password and pure math difference. The development of cryptographics promotes computer science, especially those used by computers and network security, such as access control and information confidentiality. Cryptology has been applied in daily life: including wafer cards, computer users, etc., computer users, etc., including automatic tellers.\n\ntable of Contents\n\n1 term\n\n1.1 symmetric gold key encryption\n1.2 public key encryption\n1.3 number signature\n\n\n2 History of cryptography and password analysis\n\n2.1 classic cryptography\n2.2 Medieval to Second World War\n\n2.2.1 Queen of Mary in Scotland\n2.2.2 First World War\n2.2.3 Second World War\n\n\n2.3 modern cryptography\n\n\n3 modern cryptography\n\n3.1 public key cryptography\n3.2 Password analysis\n3.3 Cryptography\n3.4 Password Protocol\n\n\n4 legal issues related to cryptography\n\n4.1 ban\n4.2 Export control\n4.3 US National Security Agency involved\n4.4 Digital Wisdom Property Rights Management\n\n\n5 reference\n6 external connection\n7 See\n\n\nTerminology [edit]\nUntil modern, cryptography almost specifically referred to the algorithm: converting normal information (plaintext) into a process of difficult to understand (ciphertext); decision algorithm is the opposite process: converted back to express text by secret text; These two algorithms are generally encrypted and decrypted simultaneously.\nThe specific operation of the addendal density is determined by two parts: one is an algorithm and the other is a key. The key is a secret parameter for the addition of the reinforcement algorithm, usually only the communicationr has. Historically, the key is usually used directly in the addendum without authentication or integrity test.\nThe password protocol is a communication protocol using password technology. Modern cryptographers think more about the traditional plus cue algorithm, the password protocol is also the same, and the two are two major issues of cryptography. In English, \"Cryptography\" and \"Cryptology\" can represent cryptography, and the former is also known as cryptography. But more rigorously, the former refers to the use of password technology, and the latter refers to the study of the password, including cryptography and password analysis. Password analysis is to study how to crack the passwordologies. However, in actual use, it is usually called cryptographic (ie, Cryptography), and does not distinguish between its meaning.\nEncoding: It refers to the specific plaintext replaced by codeword (English: Code Word). For example, replace \"Apple Pie\" (Attack At Dawn). The encoding is no longer used in rigorous cryptography, which has a more clear meaning in the principle of information or communication.\nIn Chinese speaking, the personal account password used by computer systems or networks is often known as cryptographic, although the pass code is also a scope of cryptography, but the golden key known in the academic pass code and cryptography is not The same, even between the two is often closely connected.\n\nSymmetric gold key encryption [edit]\nSymmetric gold key encryption is a cryptographic method in cryptography, is to convert one of the numbers, letters, or only string random letters, a secret key to change the text or letters inside the message in a specific manner, such as replacing the relative position For example, Hello turns to Lohel. As long as the sender is known to the recipient know the secret key, they can encrypt and decrypt and use this information.\n\nPublic key encryption [edit]\nThe public key encryption (also known as asymmetric encryption) is a cryptographic method, a non-symmetric pocket, refers to a pair of encrypted pockets and decrypted pockets, and a user is obtained using an encrypted pocket encryption. Information, only the user's decryption key can be decrypted. If you know one, you can't calculate another one. Therefore, if one of the key is disclosed, it is not harm to another. Therefore, the open gold key is the public key; the non-disclosed key is a private key.\n\nDigital signature [edit]\nDigital signature (also known as public key number, electronic signature) is a kind of signature that is written on paper, but the technical implementation of public key encryption domains, for identifying digital information. On the Internet, we can use the \"digit signature\" to confirm. Digital signature is a unique value. If the public key can be verified, then we can determine the correctness of the corresponding public key, and the number-bit signature has both dual attributes: \"Confirmability\" and \"undispire (No handwriting expert verification) \".\n\nHistory of cryptography and password analysis [edit]\nMain entry: password history\nMany physical devices are used to assist in encryption, such as the codes of the ancient Greek Sparta, which is a cylinder that assists the replacement method, which can mobilize the order of the letters in the information, use the strip to wind a wooden bar, put the letter Displacement, the recipient should use the same diameter wooden stick to get the restore. In the European Middle Ages, the password bar (English: cipher grille) is used in a certain type of intraoperative.\nAfter the multi-character encryption method, more auxiliary tools appear, such as the Bordi-invented cryptographic disk, Tritmius inventive table method, and Jefferson, the US President Tomb Mas Jefferson Invention Disc (English: Jefferson Disk) (BAZERES (English: Bazeries) is approximately independently invented in 1900).\nIn the early 20th century, multiple plus decryption machines were invented and registered, including the most famous rotor (English: Rotor Machines), the Second World War German, alias \"Mystery\" cipher (Ennigma The cryptographue machine), its encryption method is the best design for breaking the test at the time after the First World War.\nThe early 20th century biography essentially considers the linguistic model. Since then, the center of gravity, now cryptography uses a large number of mathematics, including information theory, calculating complexity theory, statistics, combination, abstract algebra, and numerical theory. Cipher is also a branch of engineering, but it is different from other, because it must face a smart and malicious opponent, most other projects require only malicious natural power. The connection between cryptography and quantum physics is also a hot study.\n\nClassic cryptography [edit]\nMain entry: classic password\nPrior to modern times, cryptography only considers the confidentiality of the message: How to convert an understandable message into an unhappy message, and make the person with secret messages can respond to back, but the lack of secret messages or eavesdroppers cannot Interpretation. In recent decades, this area has been extended to cover identity certification (or claims), message integrity check, digital signature, interaction certificate, security and multi-party calculation.\nThe ancient Chinese Zhou Chao Bing Book \"Sixty. \"Dragon\" recorded the use of cryptography, the \"\u9634\u7b26\" and \"Yin Book\" recorded Zhou Wu Wang asked Jiang Zi to the way of fighting with the main communication:\n\n\nToo public: \"The Lord and will, there is a licking, all eight, etc., there is a big victory of the enemy, long one foot. The break of the army will be the same, the fortress is nine-inch. Campaign is the same, long eight inches. The enemy is far away, and it is seven inch. The police hold down the inch, long six inch. Please ask the grain person to be five inch. The defeat army will be the same, long four inch. Failure martial arts compass, long three inch The privacy makes the line, if you think, if you think, the leaking is all. The eight accords, the main secrets, so the textbooks, do not vent the middle and foreign knowing. Although the enemy is holy, don't know. \"\nWu Wang asked Taikong: \"...\" can't be clear; the same is Liaoyuan, the words are unreasonable. What is it? \"\nToo public: \"All the shackles, use books, don't need. The Lord will be asked by the book, and the book is all right and then left, three, one, one, book For three. Sanfa, a known person, three people, people operate one point, phase transceiver, do not know, this is a blind book. Although the enemy is a holy, don't know. \"\n\n\nThe phenonis is a different message and instructions to express different messages and instructions with eight-ordered, which can be regarded as alternatives (English: substitude), transforming information into a symbol that the enemy can't understand. As for the Chinese book, the shift method is used, and the book is divided into three, divided into three people, and the three books will be reroute to get the restore.\nEntering the Song Dynasty and defined encryption method.\nIn fact, in the presen, secret letters have been used in war. The \"Parers\" of Western \"The Father of History\", which records some of the earliest secret letters. In the first 5th century BC, Greek City Bang was against slavery and aggression, and many conflicts and wars occurred with Persian. In the first 480 days of Xiyuan, Persian secretly knocked the strong army, ready to launch a raid to Athens and Sparta. The Greek Dimlatus (English: Demaratus) saw this assembly in Susak in Persian, using a layer of wax covering the word on the wooden board, sent and told the Greek Persian. Finally, the Persian Navy covers the Salamy Bay (English: Salamis Bay) near Athens.\nIt is said that Spartan commander sent a belt to the front line: [1]\nKgdeinpklrijlfgoklmnisojntvwg\nAfter the commander got, wrap it on a wooden stick and got the clear text \"Kill King\" as follows:\nKgdeinpklrijlfgoklmnisojntvwg\nThat is, one letter is taken every 4. Other letters are interference. But this legend has not been confirmed because the story occurs in Greece and Persia, but the secret text is English.\nSince most people do not know word, the earliest secret written is only used in paper pen or equivalents. As literacy rate is improved, it will begin to need real cryptography. The most classic two encryption skills are:\n\nTransposition password (English: Transposition cipher): Reissue alphabetical order, such as \"Help ME\" into \"EHPL EM\";\nAlternative password: Systematically convert a group of letters into other letters or symbols, such as \"Fly AtCe\" becomes \"GMZ Bu PODF\" (for each letter with the next letter).\nThese two simple ways are not sufficient to provide sufficient confidentiality. The Caesar password is the most classic alternative, according to the emperor of the ancient Roman Emperor, in the communication with the distant general, each letter is replaced in the back of the three-graphic alphabet.\nEncryption is designed to ensure the secret of communication, such as spy, military general, diplomatic communication, and also have religious applications. For example, early Christians use cryptography to blur the parties they write to avoid persecution. 666 or some earlier manuscripts on the 616th of the New Testament Bible reveals the number of beasts referred to, often used to distinguish the ancient Rome Emperor Nero, who is persecuted by Christians. There is also a documentary of some Hebrew passwords in history. Ancient India is also mentioned in the classics to communicate with the password. In ancient times, Hirodo Described the message to hide the message with invisible ink, mamma or digital watermarks with invisible ink, regaming or digital watermark.\nIn addition to being applied to the military, the \"Want\" 4 of the Western Yuan 4th Century Brahman scholar (English: Vatsyayana) is mentioned in the \"Want\" 4 of the book. Article 45 of the book is a secret letter (English: Mlecchita-Vikalpa) to help women conceal the relationship between them and love. One of the methods is to pair the letters casually, such as in the Roman alphabet, you can draw the following table:\n\n\n\nA\nB\nC\nDi\nE\nFly\nG\nHide\nI\nJ\nK\nL\nM\n\n\nZ\nY\nX\nW\nV\nU\nT\nS\nR\nQi\nP\nO\nN\n\nThe cryptography generated by the classic encryption method is easy to leak about the statistics on the plaintext, which is actually very easy to crack in modern views. The Arabs will mention that if you want to crack encrypted information, you can calculate the frequency of each letter in an article at least one, and count the frequency of each symbol in the encrypted letter, and then For example, this is the predecessor of frequency analysis, and there will be almost all such passwords are cracked immediately. But classic cryptography has not disappeared now, often in the riddle (see password map (English: cryptogram)). This analytical method is also used in archeology in addition to the coding method. This decryption method is used when cracked ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.\n\nMedieval to the Second World War [edit]\nAll passwords in essence are still harmful to the above-mentioned critical laws, until Abundated invented multi-letter encryption law (English: Polyalphabetic Cipher) in 1467, Abordy's innovation is different parts of the message. The code, he also invented the first automatic encrypler, a wheel that implements some of the idea. Multi-character encryption method is the most typical example of Virginia encryption: encryption reuses a keyword, which letter replaces the end of the key to which letter to the keyword. Despite this, the multi-letter encryption method is still partially harmful by frequency analysis, but this is discovered by Charles Babery until the middle of the nineteenth century.\nMore modern examples of famous examples of Medieval Scotland Mary, the First World War Germany's Zimmerman Telegraph and the \"Enny Mima\" of the Second World War.\n\nMary of Scotland [edit]\nWestern Yuan 1578, The Queen Mary was restored by Elizabeth. On January 6, 1586, Mary received a batch of secret letters and learned about Anthony Babington. Anthony and a few people with the party in a conspiracy to rescue Mary and plan to thorns the Queen of Elizabeth. Their letters are converted to a password and hide the wooden plug in the beer barrel to hide the eyes and ears. However, it was intercepted, replicated, and failed from the General Minister Walsingham, and cracked the letter by Philip Van Marnix. After the letters crack, Huaxing Han's handwriting of Philhami Ji Mary is induced by Antoni action, and the rebellious person is a net, tried and dedicated to Mary Queen. The problem is to use a fragile encryption method to make a false safety illusion: Anthony is too confident on their communication methods, making his encryption method too simple and easily crackd from the enemy.\n\nFirst World War [edit]\nOn August 25, 1914, Germany's Magdeburg cruiser (Magdeburg) was stranded in Finland, and Russia searched for many German documents and two electrical codebooks. He was sent to the UK \"No. 40 Room (ROOM 40) performs password analysis. At the same time, the inventions of the radio have also made interception secrets such as connecting. Since Germany has been cut when the cable to the United States is started at the beginning of the war, Germany borrows the US submarine cable power report to Washington, but the cable has passed the UK, January 17, 1917, was \"40 Room 40\" Intercept. On February 23, the same year, the secret content was uncovered, and the content refers to the \"unrestricted submarine war\" in Germany, including the submarine attack, including neutrality, including neutrality. In order to prevent the United States, the United States has been grouped, Germany recommends that Mexican invaded the United States and promises to help Mexico will take the Texas, New Mexico and Arizona Sanzhou from the United States. Germany also wants to convince Japan to jointly attack the United States, Germany will provide military and funding assistance. After the secret is uncovered, the United States declared war in Germany on April 16.\n\nSecond World War [edit]\nGermany learned the lessons of the first war, developing an encryption method that replaces the human hand. The Arthur Scherbius invented the \"Mystery\" (Enigma, Enny Mima Debut) for military and commercial. \"Mystery\" is mainly composed of keyboard, encoder, and light board. The three sets of encoders, coupled with the connector and other parts, the possibility of 100 billion codes. In 1925, \"Mystery\" began a series of production. In 20 years, the German military has purchased more than 30,000 \"mystery\", which is also difficult to fill \"No. 40 House\" and become an important tool for Germany in the second war. Poland is located in the east of Germany, the west of Russia, has been threatened, so the Polish Cryptography is established to obtain intelligence. Poland is an espionage from Hans-THILO Schmidt, which is interpreted by a young mathematician Marian REJEWSKI, and has been compiled by a year. In the 1930s, the \"Bomba\" (Bomba) was produced and gradually understood \"Mystery\" technology.\nIn December 1938, Germany strengthened the safety of \"mystery\", which made Poland lost information. \"Mystery\" has become the core of Hitler lightning strategy, and the encrypted alignment of the daily changes maintains a powerful and fast attack. On April 27, 1939, Germany was revoked with Poland, Poland, Poland had to decide to share the \"bomb\" ideas and English, method to solve new \"mystery\". On September 1, 1939, Germany infunded Poland and the war broke out. After the UK received the decryption technology of Poland, in addition to the original language and humanists, the Room 40 has also added mathematicians and scientists, and later, Government Code and Cipher School, 5 years The number of people increased to 7,000. From 1940 to 1942, it was a knocked and decrypted pulling war, and successful decoding provided a lot of valuable information. For example, in 1940, the German attack Denmark and Norway, and the air raid intelligence was obtained in advance in Battle of Britain, and many crises were resolved. But \"Mystery\" is not completely crackdown, plus \"mystery\" has a lot of networks, and Germany has always accounted for the wind in the Atlantic campaign. Finally, the Britain captured the \"Mystery\" cryptographic book on the German submarine in the action of \"Jihapping\", cracked the \"Mystery\". The British hides this thing in a variety of false means, lests from Germany to change the password again, and plan to destroy the German replenishment line and shorten the duration of the Atlantic campaign.\n\nModern cryptography [edit]\nThe development of computer and electronics after the Second World War has contributed to a more complex password, and the computer can encrypt any binary information, which is no longer limited to writing text, and it is eliminated by linguistics. Most computer encryption is on the two-in-binding string, and do not directly act directly on traditional alphanuces as classic cryptography. However, the computer also promoted the development of critical analysis and offset the advantages of certain encryption methods. However, excellent encryption law remains ahead, usually good encryption law is quite efficient (fast and useful resources), and cracking it requires many levels of resources, making it impossible to break.\nAlthough frequency analysis is very effective, it is often useful to encrypt the method. Do not use frequencies to crack a message, you need to know what encryption method is currently used, so it will contribute to the espionage, bribery, theft or betray. Until the nineteenth century scholars identified that the algorithm of the encryption method is not reasonable or real protection. In fact, the appropriate cryptographic mechanism (including the additional understanding method) should be safe, even if the enemy knows what is used. For a good encryption method, the secretability of the gold key should be sufficient to ensure the confidentiality of the information. This principle is first proposed by Auguste Kerckhoffs and is called Kerckhoffs' PrinciPle. Information Theory Ancestest Claude Alwood Shannon Reproduction: \"The enemy knows the system.\"\nA large number of disclosed academic research appeared in modern. This originates from the mid-1997, National Bureau of Standards, NBS; National Standard Technology Research Institute, National Standard Technology, National Standard Technology, National NATIONAL, NIST to develop digital encryption standards (DES), Whitfield Diffi and Hellman (English: Hellman) proposed pioneering papers, and publicly released RSA. From that period, cryptography became an important tool for communication, computer network, computer security, etc. Many modern password technologies depend on the difficultness of specific calculation problems, such as factorial decomposition issues or discrete logarithms. Many password technologies can be proved to be safe as long as the specific calculation problem cannot be effectively solved. In addition to a famous exception: One-time PAD, OTP, such proves is accidental rather than decisive, but is the best way to currently available.\nThe cryptographic algorithm and system designer must not only pay attention to the history of cryptography, but also must take into account the future development. For example, continuously adding computer processing speeds to enhance the speed of brute-force attacks. The potential effect of quantum calculations is already the focus of some cryptograph.\n\nModern cryptography [edit]\nModern cryptography can be roughly distinguished into several fields. Symmetric key cryptography refers to the same gold key with the transmit party and the recipient. Until 1976, this is the only public encryption method.\nResearch and Application of Modern Cryptography Pay Attention to Group Cryptography and Flow Code. Block Encryption Law In a sense, the modernization of the multi-character encryption method of Abbit. Block Encryption Method Note a block and key of the plaintext, and outputs the same size ciphertext block. Since the message is usually longer than a single block, there is a variety of ways to weave a continuous block. DES and AES are the block encryption standards approved by the US Federal Government (AES will replace DES). Despite the abolition from standards, DES is still very popular (triple data encryption algorithm deformation is still quite safe), is used in a very much application, from the automatic trading machine, email to far end access. There are also many other block encryptions that are invented, released, quality and application, there is no laxator.\nThe stream encryption method is encrypted with block encryption, and a number of any long gold key raw materials is manufactured, and the expressive sequence element or the character is combined, a bit similar to one-Time PAD. The output stream is determined according to the internal state of encryption. In some stream encryption, changes in the state of the gold key are controlled. RC4 is a fairly famous stream encryption method.\nPassword Pseudobic Functions (sometimes called message summary functions, mixed functions, have a hash function or hash function (haveh)) does not necessarily use the pocket, but related to many important password algorithms. It will input the information (usually a whole file) to output a shorter fixed length, this process is unidirectional, the reverse operation is difficult to complete, and the collision (two different inputs produce the same whispering value) The chance is very small.\nMessage Authentication Codes, MACS is very similar to the password mixture, in addition to the receiver additional secret gold key to authenticate the mixed value.\n\nPublic key cryptography [edit]\nMain entry: public key cryptography\nPublic key password, referred to as public key cryptography, but also known as a symmetric gold key passage, with respect to symmetric gold key cleavage, the biggest feature is to encrypt and decrypt different gold keys.\nIn the symmetric gold key passage, encryption and decryption use the same gold key, perhaps use different types of golden keys for different messages, but all face the puzzle of the key management. Since each pair of callors must use the golden key of his group, when the number of network members increase, the number of golden keys is increased in secondary. What is more embarrassing is that when the safe channel does not exist in both parties, how to build a common key to securely communications? If there is a channel to secure the key, you do not use the existing channel. The contradiction between this \"chicken egg, egg chicken\" is the hindrance of cryptography that cannot be applied in real world for many years.\nIn 1976, Whitfield Difi published the pioneering papers in the open key password: a pair of different values \u200b\u200bbut mathematics related gold keys, public key (public key, public key ) And privacy key (private key, private key or secret key). In the public key system, the privacy key of the public key is calculated is not feasible. Historic scholars David Kahn (English: David Kahn) describes public key passwords; \"\" The most revolutionary concept after the multi-character replacement method of literature and art. \"\nIn the public key system, the public key can be passed freely, but the private key only has the person. Typical usage is that others use public keys to encrypt the recipient, and the recipient uses its own private key to decrypt. Diffie and Hellman also show how to use the public key password to reach the Diffei Herman key exchange agreement.\nIn 1978, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Ronald Leevist, Adi Samore and Renard Ademan invents another public key system, RSA.\nUntil the 1997 public document knows that early 1970s, the Mathematician James H. Ellis (English: James H. Ellis) in British Intelligence Agency's Communications Headquarters has invented asymmetric gold key password, and Diffie -Hellman and RSA have been preceded by Malcolm J. Williamson (English: Malcolm J. Williamson) with Clifford Cocks (English: Clifford Cocks). These two oldest public key systems provide excellent encryption based, so they are used in a large number. Other public key systems are also Cramer-Shoup, El Gamal, and elliptic curve cryptography.\nIn addition to encryption, the most significant achievements of public key passwords are digital signatures. Number of signature names is the number of ordinary signatures. Their characteristics are someone who can easily manufacture, but others are difficult to counterfeit. A number of signatures can be permanently combined with the signed message and cannot be removed from the message. Digital signature generally contains two racing algorithms: one is a signature, using the private key to process the message or the message value of the message; the other is verification, using the authenticity of the public key to verify the truth. RSA and DSA are two most popular number of signature mechanisms. Number of signatures is the basis for public key infranstrungth, pki and many network security mechanisms (SSL / TLS, virtual private network, etc.).\nThe public key algorithm is mostly based on the problem of computational complexity, usually from a number of arguments. For example, RSA is derived from an integer factor decomposition problem; DSA is derived from discrete logarithms. In recent years, the fast elliptic curve cryptography is based on mathematical problems associated with elliptic curves, and is equivalent to the discrete logarithm. Since these underlying problems involve analog-to-digital multiplication or index operation, more computational resources are required relative to block encryption. Therefore, the public key system is typically a composite, containing a highly efficient symmetric gold key algorithm for encryption, and then encrypts the key used by the public key to encrypt the symmetry gold key system to enhance efficiency.\n\nPassword analysis [edit]\nMain entry: password analysis\nThe cryptographic analysis is also known as broken test. The purpose of the password analysis is to discover the weaknesses of the cryptographic mechanism, and those who are engaged in the intention of the system malicious attacker or the designer of assessing the weakness of the system. In modern, the cryptographic algorithm and agreement must be carefully checked and tested to determine their guaranteed security.\nVolkswagen general misunderstanding believes that all encryption methods can be cracked. The work of Shannon during World War II has proven that as long as the gold key is completely random, no revitalization, the external absolute confidentiality, and the message equal to the message is unlikely to crack. In addition to most encryption methods other than one secret can be cracked in violent attacks, the efforts required to crack the length of the gold key may be growing.\nThere are many ways to analyze the password analysis, so there are several categories. A common separate law is how much information is attacked. In the DIS attack, the cryptographic analyst can only access ciphertext, and the good modern cryptographic system is usually immunized to this situation. In known mandatory attacks, password analysts can access multiple plaintext, ciphertext pairs. In the selection of the plaintext attack, the cryptographic analyst can be selected for any text and be given to the corresponding ciphertext. For example, the gardening method used in Britopy in World War II. Finally, in the selection of ciphertext attacks, the cryptographic analyst can choose any ciphertext and give the corresponding plain text.\nThe cryptographic analysis of the symmetric gold key encryption is often aim to find more efficient ways than known best breaking methods. For example, cracking DES with the simplest violence, requires a known clear text and 255 decryption operation, trying nearly half possible positors. Linear Analysis Attack Method For DES 243 known apparent and 243 DES operations, it is obviously effective than violence.\nThe public key ranking algorithm is based on a variety of mathematical problems, and the most famous is integer decomposing and discrete logarithmic issues. Many public key cryptographic analysis is a numerical algorithm for studying how these calculation issues is efficiently solved. For example, it is known that the discrete logarithmic problem based on an elliptic curve is more difficult than an integer factor of an integer factor of the same key size. Therefore, in order to achieve equal safety intensity, the technique based on factor decomposition must use a longer gold key. Due to this factor, the public key cryptographic system based on the elliptic curve is gradually popular from the mid-1990s.\nWhen a pure password analysis focuses on the algorithm itself, some attacks focus on the weaknesses performed by the cryptographic device, called the sub-pass attack. If the cryptographer can access the device to execute the encryption or return password error, it may use the timing attack method to crack the password. Attackers may also study the mode and length of the message, and it is useful to report, called traffic analysis, which is quite effective for the enemy of the unit. Of course, social engineering and other attacks on personnel, social attacks and breaking motions may be the most powerful attack method.\n\nPassword learning original [edit]\nMost cryptographic theory studies are exploring password learning principles: the algorithm of basic cryptography and is related to other issues. For example, it is easy to forthbly operational unidirectional functions. In general, if you want to be secure, you must ensure that the one-way function is present. However, if the one-way function exists, it means P \u2260 NP. Since the current P and NP issues are still unsubalypse, we have no knowledge of the one-way function. If the one-way function exists, the safe quotular number generator exists with the quotient function.\nCurrently known password learning radicals provide only basic functions. Usually confidential, messaging, authentication, and undeniable. Any other functionality is a combination and extension of the basic algorithm, which is called a cryptographic system. For example, PGP, SSH, SSL / TLS, public key infrastructure, and digital signatures. Other password prototypes also have an encrypted algorithm itself, unidirectional arrangement, dark door arrangement, etc.\n\nPassword protocol [edit]\nMain entry: password protocol\nIn many cases, cryptographic techniques involve two or more parties (such as company headquarters and segment) or leaping time (such as protecting backup materials). The password protocol has been extended to a variety of topics, such as interaction prove, secret sharing, and zero knowledge, more complex e-banknotes and security multi-party calculations.\nWhen a good password system is safely failed, there are few vulnerabilities in the cryptographic prototype. Most weaknesses happen to the agreement design, the system is actually, or some people are wrong. Many cryptographic agreements have developed in non-systematic processes, rarely have a secure proof. Some formal analysis agreements are allocated on mathematical logic (such as BAN (English: BAN) logic) or the recent specific security principles, these are the themes of researchers for decades. Unfortunately, these tools are fairly cumbersome and cannot be used for complex design. How to implement and integrate cryptographics itself is a distinct area, see cryptography and safety engineering.\n\nLegal issues related to cryptography [edit]\nBoard [edit]\nCryptography has long been interested in intelligence or judicial institutions for a long time. Due to the implicitness of these units and the reduction in personal privacy after the ban, cryptography is also the focus of human rights supporters. The legal issues surrounded by cryptography have long history, especially after the high-quality password, cheap computer.\nCryptology in some countries or even the national biography is also limited. Until 1999, France still limits the use of domestic cryptography. Many countries have more stringent restrictions, such as Belarus, Kazakh, Mongolia, Pakistan, Russia, Singapore, Tunnesia, Venezuela and Vietnam.\nIn the United States, domestic use is legal, but there are still many legal conflicts. A particularly important issue is the export control of password software and hardware. Due to the important role of password analysis in the World War II, I also expect cryptography to sustain in national security, and many Western national governments strictly regulate the export of cryptography. After World War II, it was illegal to spread the encryption technology in the United States. In fact, encryption technology has been regarded as military needs, just like tanks and nuclear weapons. The situation until the personal computer and Internet network have changed. Good cryptography and bad cryptography have no difference in most users. In fact, most of the current password technologies are generally slow and easier. However, when the internet network is growing with personal computers, excellent encryption technology is gradually known. It can be seen that the export control will become an obstacle to business and research.\n\nExport control [edit]\nA number of events challenged US export norms occurred in the 1990s. One of them was the PGP encryption of Phil Zimmerman, which was released in the Internet in June 1991. After the protest of RSA Security, Zimmermann was investigated by the Ministry of Commerce and the Federal Survey. Then, Daniel Bernstein, the University of Berklai California launched a legal proceedings of the US government, with some views of the freedom of the ban. In 1995, the Bernstein V. United States (English: Bernstein V. United States) has contributed to the US Constitutional Speech Freetenance of the original code of the printed cryptographic algorithm in 1999. In 1996, 39 countries signed a Warsa Convention on the Export of Military Exports. The convention is not referred to as a short-gold key length (a symmetric pocket 56-bit element; RSA 512-bit yuan) is no longer subject to export control. From 2000, the US export password has been loose. Now, almost all Internet users can access excellent cryptography, in the browser built-in transport layer security protocol (TLS) or a security sleeve layer (SSL). Mozilla Thunderbird and Microsoft Outlook email User ends can be connected to the IMAP or POP server with a TLS and transmit encrypted email with S / MIME. Many network users don't know that their basic application has a large number of cryptographic systems. These browsers and mail programs are so popular, even trying to regulate the public's government units that use codenics to use the government units that are unable to conduct effective restrictions.\n\nUS National Security Agency involves [edit]\nAnother cryptographic dispute site is the intervention of the US National Security Agency (US National Safety Administration) in the development of encryption. The National Security Authority considered the federal standards developed as the national episode, and We included in the development of IBM. DES is developed by NSA and IBM for the combined potential analysis method, this attack is not disclosed until the late 1980s. According to STEVEN Levy, IBM re-discovered differential analysis, but was banned by NSA. This attack is disconnected from Biham and Shamir (English: Shamir). These things show that it is difficult to decide which resources or knowledge of the attacker. In 1993, NSA was involved in encrypted microcrystals CLIPPER CHIP (English: Clipper CHIP) plans in Capstone (English: Capstone). Clipper has criticized cipher scholars, one is because its encryption algorithm is listed as confidentiality, and NSA may deliberately design a weak encryption method to reach intelligence purposes; the second is the entire account violation of Kirkhof principle, due to This mechanism uses a particularly government's appointment gold key, which is difficult to protect the possibility of eavesdropping.\n\nDigital Smart property management [edit]\nDigital Wisdom Property Rights Management is also known as Digital Rights Management, DRM)\nCryptography is the core of digital smart property rights, and many technologies are applied to the use of copyright materials. In 1998, US President Bill Clinton signed several Millennium Copyright Act (Digital Millennium Copyright Act, DMCA), which clearly determined the revision or spread of criminal acts, especially some evaders. . This has caused a considerable potential impact on the cryptographic research community because any reverse decoding techniques can be used to crack DRM thus being identified as a violation of DMCA. Considering these disputes, the US Federal Investigation Bureau and the Ministry of Justice did not strictly implement DMCA. A cipher scholar Niels Ferguson (English: Niels Ferguson) has publicly stated affected by DMCA, and he will not release some research to Intel security design. The second year of Linux core, Alan Cox and Professor, Princeton University, edward felten (English: Edward Felten) have been related to this bill. Dmitry Sklyarov (English: Dmitry Sklyarov) was in violation of the bill for several months from Russia to the United States, but violated DMCA's works actually occurred in Russia, and in Russia is legal. Similar things happen in many countries. For example, the Copyright Directive made by the EU (English: Copyright Directive). In 2007, the golden key responsible for digital multi-function audio and video disc and HD DVD anti-counterfeiting is discovered and is on the Internet. At the same time, the US Film Association issues a number of non-DMCA notices, leading to a large number of Internet users, also A issue of fair use and freedom of speech is taken out.\n\nReference [edit]\n\n\n^ Wang Shuhe. \"Mathematical Romance\".

According to the former definition, it can be divided into multiped, pan the god, and the title. According to the latter, no theory, naturalism, can not be known [2], etc., is also different religious beliefs. These religious systems, including personal behavior, traditional ritual, values, world concept, classic work, worship, moral normative or social groups. Religion is a consensus and reverence of a certain system. The humanologist Clevrew Germ is claimed to complement with myths and philosophy, and religion is equivalent to a \"survival of survival\" in a human social sector. [3]\nDifferent religions may contain different elements, including but not limited to sexy, sacraging, beliefs, supernatural existence (one or more), the ultimate or superior life experience of believers or strength. The form of religion includes ceremonies, preaching, commemorative or worship, sacrifice, sacrifice, holiday, festive, funeral service, marriage service, prayer, music, art, dance, public service or other cultural form. Religion may record the origin of life, universe or other things through the sacred history, the symbolic meaning and holy land, and to express the meaning of life. In the traditional sense, faith is considered a source of religious beliefs. About 10,000 different religions around the world [4], about 84% of the population are attached to one of the world's main religions, Catholic, Christian, Islam, Hindu, Buddhism, Taoism, or different forms of folk religion [5].\nSome faith groups, especially some emerging religions, may be given a \"cult\"; however, the faithful faith group and the legitimate religious room usually have no real difference, so the current American religious course has abandoned the use of \"cult\" \"This subjective concept, replaced by neutral\" emerging religion \"concept without derogatory color [6] [7] [8], and some scholars think more about\" cult \"is a group with different dogms and rituals. Personal attack. [9] Megan Goodwin pointed out that in the general people's usage, the so-called \"cult\", in fact, is \"the religion I don't like\", so it is [10] and religious scholars Rodney Stark and William SIMS Bainbridge (The Future Of Religion) published in 1996, the next commentary At the beginning, all religions are hidden, tiny and deviated from the mainstream \"cult\". \"[11]\n\ntable of Contents\n\n1 word source\n2 definition\n3 content\n\n3.1 teachings\n3.2 Teacher\n3.3 Teach\n\n\n4 origin\n\n41,000\n4.2 Do you have a spoon\n4.3 Witchcraft\n4.4 Language Diseases\n4.5 Original God\n4.6 functionalism\n4.7 Mythical Structure\n\n\n5 criticism\n\n5.1 Religious Issue\n5.2 religious emotionism\n5.3 Religious will\n5.4 Religious end\n\n\n6 discussion\n\n6.1 ranking\n6.2 \u8bba \u8bba\n6.3 Metal\n\n\n7 influence\n\n7.1 politics\n7.2 Culture, Art\n7.3 science\n\n\n8 major religion\n\n8.1 Non-institutional religion\n8.2 Existing Institutional Religion\n8.3 Other Decidia Religion\n\n\n9 Confucian religious dispute\n10 reference\n11 extended reading\n12 See\n\n\nWord source [edit]\nIn Chinese, the words have its meaning, this is not a unified buffer word.

San Duan, the sun and the moon, watching astronomy In the case of the observation, the gods are also in the case. \"Subject,\" Zong \"said the respect and worship of the natural universe and the human ancestors of human ancestors. \"Teaching\" refers to education, feedback, inspiration, etc., which focus on expressions and dissemination of the expression of God, humanity, or a certain atrial system, which is relatively close to the word connotation of the Western Religion. Modern China often called Confucian thinking and tradition as \"holy teaching\", this \"teaching\" connotation is extremely similar to the Western Religion.\nUntil the 10th century, \"religion\" as a bobby word, first seen in the Buddhist scriptures, such as the \"Renewal Lighting\" [12]: \"I have been in the mountains, no religion, dare to be tired of the court.\" The word \"religious\", the teachings of the Buddha tradition and its disciples, and the term is narrow. However, since the Central and Western exchanges of the Chinese and Western China's academic community, and the word \"religion\" in the modern Chinese in modern Chinese, with the rise of the Chinese and Western China's academic community. The word Religion \"has a concept of general meaning; the Western Religions Study is also translated in order to religion, that is,\" religion \"is the discipline of research objects. Religious score from the earliest theology, but ultra-off the research direction with religious prejudice in traditional theology, and turning the commonality and characteristics between various religions, the essence of religion is the research direction, emphasizes the maintenance of religion. Research.\nIn Western languages, \"Religion\" is derived from the Latin Religio of the ancient Roman era. Religio is related to modern Western religion concepts, but more belongs to a spiritual concept. The ancient Roman philosophers used Relegere in its book \"The Best of God\", which would be anti-reading, meditation) or Religere (ideal as paying attention, be careful), visible to him at the time of worship It is necessary to pay attention to it. In addition, the ancient Roman Augustus Augustine is expressed by Religare and the residual relationship between people, God and the soul in the \"The Quantity of the Soul\" and the Soul of the Soul. Augustine also used RE-Eligere in \"revised\" and \"The City of God\" to express people's reparies and decisions, people need to re-considerate and choose to make well. Therefore, the word Religio is basically used in Latin to express people to sacred beliefs, obligations and worship, and the combination between the gods, which is more closely integrated with the combination of theology. The medieval Europeans have started from the perspective of theology, often with a slightly derogatory Paganism (Chinese translation as \"paganism\", but because of the lack of relevant contexts, only as a neutral word) other non-Christian beliefs such as Islam; English vocabulary Religion and its corresponding Chinese concept \"religion\" is neutral vocabulary, which can be used to refer to Christian, Islam, Buddhism, and other religions.\n\nDefinition [edit]\nReligion has a variety of definitions, most definitions tries to find balance in many extreme interpretations and unconscious expressions. Some people think that the application form and theory are defined, and some people have emphasized the factors, sensibility, intuition, and ethics.\nEastern and West also have different differences due to historical background, and religion is a translation resignation. Feng Youlan pointed out: \"Have its own meaning, you can't see a teachings in Chinese, think is religion.\" Take \"the way to serve the gods\" means, the key is \"as the\" Zong \"of the ritual site, not as the\" teaching \"of the sacrifices of Chinese humanism hindrances.\" [13]\nSociologists and anthropologists tend to think of religion as an abstract concept, meaning. This kind of abstraction is based on its own cultural development.\nThe definition of modern famous monks to religion is - \"Zong\" has: main, important, respectful three meaning. \"Teaching\" has: three meanings of education, teaching, and teaching [14].\nTaiwanese monks, the founders of the Gully, the founders, the release of the sacred, considered \"There is a person who believes that the taught is the religion.\" [15]\nIn the \"Religious Encyclopedia\", the definition of religion is like this: [16]\n\n In summary, it may be said that almost every known culture involves the religious in the above sense of a depth dimension in cultural experiences at all levels-a push, whether ill-defined or conscious, toward some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life. When more or less distinct patterns of behaviour are built around this depth dimension in a culture, this structure constitutes religion in its historically recognizable form. Religion is the organization of life around the depth dimensions of experience- Varied In Form, Completeness, and Clarity In Accordance With the environing culture. \"\n.mw-parser-output .templatequote {margin-top: 0; overflow: hidden} .mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite {line-height: 1em; text-align: left; padding-left: 2em; margin- Top: 0} .mw-parser-output .templatequote .TemplateQuotecite cite {font-size: small}\nTranslation: In summary, each known culture contains more or less religious beliefs, they or clearly try to perfectly explain this world. When some behavior is established in a particular culture, it will lay a deep historical imprint in this culture.

(June 19, 2018)\nA religion is a religion because it consists of three levels. It is a religious ideological concept and feelings (doctrine), the second is religious worship behavior and etiquette norms (tiger), three for religious faculty system and Social organization (teaching group).\n\nDemon [edit]\nThe teachings of religion are mainly divided into \"concept\" and \"experience\".\n\nType of concept\nConcept of soul\nGod concept\nDead concept\nReligious experience\nFear\nGet [Source Request] Experience Type\nReligious theory\nReligious morality\nReligious practice\nThat is, the awe of the gods is the internal factors and core of the whole religion. Therefore, \"the belief in God\" is all the fundamental of all religions. The object of religious beliefs is understood as a super natural and control natural mystery or sacred, it is regarded as the power, elf, gods, to the high god, or abstractly absolute, eternal, supreme, self There is a perimeter, an infinite existence, surpass the time and space. This belief is regarded as the origin of everything and the foundation and basis of all existence. However, all religions have the same understanding of God, it is possible to \"many and orderly\", \"single-row him\", it is possible to \"super\" or \"inner\" existent, it constitutes multi-gods, a title, single The primary god education, binary god education, etc., there is also a different temper of super population, pan the god, and all things have different mymens.\nThe interpretation of religion to the concept of \"Theology\", theology is constantly being adjusted in religious spread, historical evolution, and human progress. Theology is the maximum difference between consciousness and spontaneous religion, because theology has its theoretical and systematic, and spontaneous religion is not theological system.\n\nTeacher [edit]\nwitchcraft\nTaboo\nprayer\nSacrifice\nrepent\nWorship\nThe worship behavior of religion, etiquette norms belong to the external factors of religion. It reflects the practice of religious doctrine, and also reflects the reform of religious traditions and its social culture background. The tube is standardized, stylized, institutionalized and institutionalized, including prayers, sacrifices, sacred, etiquette, practice and ethics.\nThe teach is based on religious theoretical system, and the tutor is based on social practice activities. The former provides basis and guidance for the latter, the latter makes the mental interest in the former promotes and externalizes; the former is constantly interpretation, collection, and compiling religious classics and deepen The latter is also an empirical accumulation to determine the extent of its implementation, so the teachings and tollors produce a publicly recognized social practice in the cultural atmosphere.\n\nTeam [edit]\nReligious faculty and education system (such as: Christian church, pastoral area, Buddhist monks Garaga, representing the institutionalization and socialization of religious belief system, is the outermost shell of religion, but it is indispensable. On the one hand, the activity space is provided for religion and also gives an existence guarantee. The faculty system makes religion have visible external forms to work on society. In history, political and religion often have one or separation, reflecting the organic combination of social administrative functions and priest religious functions, indicating that the individual and secular society have both links and differences.\nThe formation of the teaching group and the faculty marks the maturity of the human belief system, enriches religious, complementing the doctrine and tongue, and highlights the uniqueness of religion and other social consciousness and social culture history. Different characteristics.\n\nOrigin [edit]\nReligion stems from the quasi-religious phenomenon, before the original religion, one of the earliest forms of human awareness activities in today's knowledge, but when there is no supernatural body concept, the object is not empty, no worship The idea, everything is fully alive, think that certain actions can affect certain phenomena or things, such as spell witchcraft, needle-piercing wooden engraved, wearing jade, etc.\nThe beast image of the old stone mural murals is covered with traces of cuttings, and it is considered to be a spell to increase hunting medals. In the tomb of Ni Ander, the mountains and other tomb, all discovered that the bones were covered with red powder and gravel, which may be a blood-colonial line, so as to ask the deceased to be stable or regenerated. When religious and god concept forms, the witchcraft spell has become a religious annex. The disciplines studying religious origins are religious anthropology, the main theory is a spoon, before, all things have spoken, witchcraft, original one, functionalism, mythological structure, and language diseases, the top four are evolution theory, The three cultural circle schools.\n\nEverything is spoken [edit]\nMain entry: Tarnance\nEverything is made by the British archaeologist Edward Burnet Taylor, and the primitive people have the concept of \"all things\" before forming religion, people feel people in the shadow, reflection, echo, breathing, sleep. There is an intangible thing within the physical body, which makes people live, and when the feelings of dreams are the most affected, when this unknown thing leaves the body, the body lost the ability, and the breathing also stops, Taylor said this Unknown things are anima. The primitive people have done all grow or activities, and they are even as anima, but modern religiousologists believe that the primitive people do not have this abstract reasoning ability, and have not found any archaeological empirics.\n\nBefore 10,000 pony [edit]\nEverything is a spoon (English: Animatism), \"Physical Actim\", \"Fantasian Worship\", is a revision of the humanologist Robert Ranulph Marett (Robert Ranulph Marett) to all things, he believes the original person At the time of the concept of \"all things\", it has a concept that it is to think that the whole world is alive. Therefore, everything in the world is also live, and it is not a premise that all things have their own independent soul, but no Find any archaeological empirical.\n\nWitchcraft [edit]\nThe witchcraft is proposed by Fraser. He believes that human spirit is developed by witchcraft to religion, and then to science. Witchcraft is a quasi-religious phenomenon. The primitive believes that witchcraft can control nature, the reason is nothing more than the proof or similar law, that is, a part of the method can affect the whole thing of the matter, or that the similar object to the subject can affect the object, but When the human beings do not believe this virtual force, the transfer is to the soothing and compassion of supernatural existence.\n\nLanguage diseases: [edit]\nLanguage Diseases said by German philosopher Max Miller, he believes that ancient Indio language abstract words, some conceptual vocabulary must give a personality link, otherwise it will not be used. The gods were originally just the name of the natural phenomenon, and later learned from the vocabulary, it caused a sense, and myth was born. In this way, the object that causes awe is gradually masked by the language, and is finally separated from the direct perception due to metaphor behavior.\n\nOriginal a God [edit]\nThe original aid is proposed by Schmit. He believes that in the oldest culture, there is the most fascinating existence, which can be seen in the nation of the North American Polar Nationality, the southeastern in Australia, so the title is the oldest humanity. Religious view, the image of God is the initial revelation from God. The future religion is degraded, and it is covered by the gods and ghosting strange.\n\nFunctionalism [edit]\nMain entry: functionalism\nThe function of functionality is first proposed by the British anthropologist, also known as a series of functional theories. He believes that religious rituals and witchcraft behavior are to meet the psychological needs of individuals, slowing their life pressure. Providing positive attitude towards life and death test, also protecting the traditions and values \u200b\u200bof tribes, which are mainly divided into biometric, mental and normative.\n\nMythology Structure: [edit]\nMythology Structure said that the french anthropologist Li Vihai, he believes that the original human soul of different places in the world has a common structure. Here is to explain the world, this common phase is a set of myths. The original power.\n\nCritique [edit]\nThis section does not provide a reference source, and the content may not be verified. (June 19, 2018)\nReligious Issue [edit]\nReligiousness Theory is to explore religions with reason, logic, it is like a double-edged sword, but also teaches teaches.\nThe anti-teacup people's view is the most prominent, first of all, he believes that if all things have caused, God should no exception, and the first cause of religion is not logically. Second He believes that science has a degree of randomness. Today, we know that quantum mechanics, chaos theory also has a certain degree of irreQibility, which indicates that natural law is likely to have a hand of God, but only constantly changing Scientific temporary conclusion. In addition, he believes that the monologist is full of \"human choice principles\", and theologist thinks that the world is like this. It is to make people survive. This is undoubted to say that people grow tall nose is for Like the truth of the glasses, the result will change the result, Russell believes that human beings are only a product of natural evolution. If God is a creator, why created a fascist party or so many terrorism? He also believes that if the non-standard depends on God, the God should not have goodness to be good, if God is good, then I have to admit that it is non-standard by the things other than God, this two difficulties Also make the title of the the the the theth.\nSwinburn is a famous rationalism. He mainly starts from \"why there is the most common natural law\". He emphasizes that many people ignore the universe does not exist, or it is always in chaotic state, so it may be very large. This universe of this high order is surprising, beyond science, and this is not due to unable to explain behind scientific, but the nature of science must finally have a certain ultimate natural law and material structure. One of this \"ultimate\" may explain is a title, because God will definitely be able to do this, order sexually in order to control nature, change nature, change nature . Evolutionary view is impossible to design in this issue, because we can't help but ask such a law, what is it? This makes us either uninterrupted, either explanation from hypotheses, rating a reasonable explanation of a monument assumption.\nFor the two kinds of rationalism (peer and related theory) from scientific, rational to interpret religion, Paul Tian Like believes that too many people think of religion is a knowledge that religious authority relying on religious authority, but he must clarify Religion and science have essentially (separated matter), it is unnecessary with science to go to the anti-education or care education, because the truth seeks in different rations, the science can be treated, and science can only be with another science phase. Fight, religion can only compete with another religion. He believes that the quantum has not been allowed to launch, and some people are used to prove the theory of creation, and they say that freedom is ridiculous. The struggle is the most strihy of evolution, and the opponents are only in the literal meaning of the Bible, and the creation of creation is scientifically, distorted.\n\nReligious emotion [edit]\nReligious emotions aim to indicate that the essence and significance of religion is not reflected in the activities and achievements of reason, and is an intuitive \"unlimited person\", the \"sacred person\" is absolutely, unconditional dependence. Schlelmach believes that critical or moral ethics to criticize religion is superficial, scientific and scientific, with the inevitability of the world, with the uniqueness of the facts, and the morality, and the morality from people, develop a responsible system Why shouldn't you do it by the ultimate authority command? Religion has a set, in general, religion is \"absolute dependence\". Through the actual limited activities, we have faced those invisible, eternal full of respect, once intuitive universe, knowing that they are small and humble, thus evogene \"for unlimited emotions\". Otto pointed out that religious classics describes the gods in a large number of vocabulary. When the conveyor concept is, the more clearly determined the religion, but religion is \"unreasonable\" (Note: Not \"rationality\" the Irrational. We only borrow vocabulary to determine the subject's properties, but this unlimited body cannot rely on them to understand, he pointed out this highest intuition-\"sacred person\" - must exclude any moral factor, this \"mystery \"The\" fear \",\" noble \"and\" energetic \".\nEmotional discussion is logical question, Schlelmah, the religious experience that does not have emotions is to talk about faith, religion, and in other words, the religious emotions can prove belief. But don't forget that if religion is \"unreasonably\", why can religious emotions demonstrate faith in causal logic? Once this proof is recognized, it recognizes that religion contains intellectual components, it must accept the critique of psyllism. Although Outo shows that the religious experience can only be seen as \"a substitute for the solution\" to approach religion, it is the closest language that describes the ultimate human beings in conjunction, but this is inevitable. The concept is able to describe religious experience. Contemporary scholars have a more study pointing that emotions need to rely on understanding or concepts, which are rational elements, rather than \"unreasonably\" proposed by non-emotions. Another religger Pan Nengberg criticizes the emotionalist to reduce religion to personal experience. Religion is only the subjective of unlimited emotions, but this subjective has no binding.\n\nReligious will [edit]\nReligious will theory from Pasca, by William James. In summary, the beliefs do not reach our choice of letter and do not believe, but analyzing risks to make bets, can use the five words of \"Belief's bet\". The premise is that God is a \"real choice\", James defines the real choice \"\" There is vital, unavoidable, have a major value \", at the moment we are in the opposite side, all have arguments, in the future I don't see some people fully support or overthrow the propositions of God, so we don't want to be committed to gain, and lose the benefits because of avoiding fallacy, and this is also very likely to make God's unhappy, and believe and do not believe it. It is a major bet. If you believe there is God's existence, gambling will get everything, if you bet, you will not lose anything, but if you don't believe in God's existence, bets Win just the victory of emotions, and bet Loss will lose your life.\nRegarding the opinion of the will, Russell criticism is \"utilitarian, subjective\", first, James only wishes to believe that the religion can get eternal life, but he didn't confirm in this proposition, it is possible to believe in hell It is also said. In addition, the devout religious, God is exactly, as a person like Mao Zedong in history, the orthodox religious person will think \"I believe in God, I am blessed\", not James, \"if Let God, you will happiness. \" The willingness of the religion will be divided into religious, sacred, and the modern businessman who is absolutely dedicated to become utilitarian will only become the best, do not explore the truth.\n\nReligious end pole [edit]\nHumans generally recognize the entire universe must be the same as one of the ultimate roots. Therefore, as the countries that are generally considered will eventually die, religion should be treated in human society, and they should also die in the ultimate inclusion and identity. in. [Source Request]\n\nDiscuss [edit]\nThis section does not provide a reference source, and the content may not be verified. (June 19, 2018)\nDue to the development of information, religious freedom, plus social economy and self-sufficiency, global integration, and Earth Village gradually formed. Dialogue between religion is not just self-survival, preaching the need for the right path, is also a way to conflict with disasters, whether it is the inter-church, or all religious rooms, more and more people put forward to talk, and all religions have their own self-position. It is the alien, multi-graphical and merger.\n\nHerism [edit]\nIt is absolutely true in many religions, and the rest is false. It has an absolute view on the truth, and this is the nature of religion. If a religion is not the only \"truth\", then It is not worthy of beliefs. In fact, any congress will naturally have an intrinsic exclusive exclusive exclusive to his religion. Orthodoxism is the orthodox position of most of the gods, they only think that their God is true God, only to be dedicated to the religion to be saved, and other religions are deemed to be non-real. When this exclusive excluding other races become racism, or to eliminate other pagans, it has become a closed religion, and there is a large-scale battle in the history of human understanding.\nAbraham (Christ religion, Jewish and Islam) have strong row of hunt, emphasizing the only true god. Christ religion (including Catholicism, Orthodox Church and new education) is a typical exclusive discipline, but part of Christ religion also proposes \"universal salvation\". So this has become a difficult problem. In addition, Christ's new teach emphasizes the \"Senses to save\", causing the reversal of his arguments to think that this is just a narrow salvation, which is not good as the beauty of the United States.\n\nMulti-therametic [edit]\nMain entry: multi-draft\nMulti-alarm advocates that all major beliefs in the world is very different, but this is just that we call God or God's equally effective understanding, experience and response. Hick believes that all religions are like the truth of \"blind\". We can't conclude that the religion is true, because the truth is likely to be completely confirmed, each religion is just \"different lights, the same light\".\nHowever, the anti-polyvoepers believe that this will undermine the essence of religion, and if other religions are also right, the religious doctrines, the Holy Society is lacking unique. The blind man is not shared in the different ends of the end, but it is all wrong, and the tail is not a representative. Unless someone can talk about the entity of the entire icon, all religious standing out of the conversation, just a pair of blinds, and it is better to say that it is wrong. In addition, anti-multi-pilot believes that Christians have to talk to Buddhists, and they have to be unknowwords, and they have unreasonable consensus. This is just a lot of blind people talking, and it is getting farther and farther.\n\nMetalism [edit]\nMergence theory standing on his theory and multi-diversity, it thinks The emperor had to have one, but other religions see the \"legal religion\", god gave the revelation of religious redemption, but other religions were mixed with the deviation of cultural differences when they accepted God, they expressed and It is better to have some religion, other religions are just some \"unknown people\". They accepted some of the ideas of some of the wrong mistakes, and orthodox believes are to correct them.\nAnti-mergers believe that this argument will merge with a very disadvantageful position, because if other religion accepts revelations, it is also possible to get the Shenge Demon Redemption, why do you want to convince them to believe in orthodial religion? \"The\" unnamed people \"is even more exciting, since everyone has God's grace, the kind of religion is the real religion? That kind is the unknown religion? This implied exclusiveness also makes both the merger two heads.\n\nImpact [edit]\n World main religious distribution\nReligion is widely existed in various countries and nations in the world.\n\nPolitics [edit]\nThis section does not provide a reference source, and the content may not be verified. (June 19, 2018)\nThe relationship between religion and politics is very complicated, and religious beliefs will affect law. Religion is also a social ideology and is part of the upper building. Historically, religion often is used as a spiritual tool for rule people. On the other hand, religion is often used as a tool for anti-oppression.\nModern in many countries, citizens have the freedom of religious beliefs, and there are only freedoms of religion, and there is a freedom of religion. Let's believe in this kind of teaching, and there is also the freedom of the kind of teaching. It is one of the basic rights of citizens. In the Middle Ages, there are many countries in the world to adopt a system of political and disclosure, and the national regime and religion are one. The leader of the religious leader is the head of the country, directly mastering the national regime; set up a single religion to become a national education, the teaching is a national law, citizens must believe And obeying, citizens do not believe in the freedom of other religions or non-beliefs, otherwise they will be considered to be \"pagan\" and persecuted. But in ancient China, due to the influence of Confucianism, citizens allow citizens to believe in the freedom of other religions, but various other religions must be included in the framework of Confucian ethics. The religion of the People's Republic of China must be one of the patriotic ideology. Marxist views believe that religion will disappear when social development into communism.\n\nCulture, art [edit]\nIn the development of religion, inevitable will be integrated with culture and art.\n\nReligious art\nReligious literature\nReligious painting\nReligious architecture\nReligious drama\nReligious dance\nReligious art\nReligious costume\nScience [edit]\nMain entry: Religion and Science\nThere are many famous scientists in history, such as Eucula and Kexi. Ferman believes that more than half of scientists have no religious beliefs (in the 1950s), and science cannot argue God does not exist. [17] Due to the many \"truth\" of religion, it is not confirmed but is said to be like the \"truth\", just the logic, the content is not really precise. According to the recent survey, scientists believe in religion is the lowest.

In some countries and regions, Confucianism (Confucius) is always considered religion, so the Confucianism (Confucius) in the form of religious form has always existed, such as in Taiwan, there is a Chinese Confucianism [19], in Indonesia, with a well church [ 20] In Hong Kong, there is also a well-collected college as a religious group.\nConfucianism has a controversy, mainly in Confucianism without the obvious ultimate goal as the general religion, but the gods have also not clear the ultimate goal. And Confucianism is based on the Han Wudi \"Since the hundreds of people, the only Confucianism\" uses political power to religion, and the Confucianism is teaching [21], so there is a political support Confucianism to absorb many folk beliefs. Related knowledge It also produces its own exclusive ritual to make it more in the form of a reload to a r believer, and there is a complete system in the Song Dynasty [22], however Christian, Islamic development is also based on the support and shaping of political power.\n\nReference [edit]\n\n\n^ Religion, Merriam-Webster Dictionary.\n\n^ Religion originated.

[1] [2] \"Stanford Philosophy Encyclopedia\" [3] Think \"belief\" is a broad term, which appears in the language expressing a variety of concepts; in the most common sense, \"Faith) and The meaning of \"trust\" is substantially the same. However, the narrative and discussion of beliefs in philosophy is almost entirely limited to the religious beliefs of God, and they are both belief in God. And usually, they are dealt with the beliefs in the Christian branches in Abrahamic Traditions, although there is no other faith.\nIn the concept of religion, the belief can be divided into two kinds of confidence and trust. [4]\nPeople who believe in religion often take belief as their confidence, they will be clearly self-evident, [5] [6]\nOthers have a tendency to believe in faith and not admit that the existence of the gods believe that belief is a creed with no evidence. [7]\nGenerally in distinguishing between beliefs and confidence, it is such an example. I said that I have one hundred yuan in my pocket. I told me to take it out. It is faith. If you believe me, it is confidence.\nBelief, it is a choice and hold of people to life, values \u200b\u200band worldviews.\nBelief, for human life, choose the value of the value, lifestyle, and human sense of life.\nBelief, whether it is objective with the object of the object of faith. Religion itself is not faithful, but the expression of faith, the form of performance is not suitable as a belief.\nBelief is generally considered to be formed by external factors. Most of them are affected by parents, social, political, religious and traditional ideology. Only the process of beliefs must be inherently responded, which takes a personal experience and pursuit of life, thereby choosing a belief that is suitable for you. [Source Request]\nBelief can be obtained, can be shaped or abandoned. Although many religions have strict restrictions on the departure of believers, according to the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, people have freedom and rights to choose religion, or choose not to believe in religion.\n\ntable of Contents\n\n1 Relationship between beliefs and beliefs\n2 criticism\n3 See\n4 reference\n\n\nRelationship between belief and belief [edit]\nSee: Belief \u00a7 Faith - believe - knowledge and belief # belief-in_and_belief-there (English: belief # belief-in_and_belief-That)\nFaith (English: Belief, Belief-That), belief is a personal judgment and choosing a truth of the authenticity of things, and the correctness of the belief depends on the personal knowledge level including reasoning.\nFaith can be described as an attitude of the correctness or not of the proposition, which is different from belief-in. Belief-IN is more closely related to the concept of trust or belief (Faith) because it usually refers to a human attitude. In many religious traditions, the central role is played, of which \"God\" is the core virtue of its believers (also known as God). [8]\n\nCriticism [edit]\nBritish philosopher and logician Nobel Literature Award winner Betland Russell wrote: [7]\n\n.mw-parser-output .templatequote {margin-top: 0; overflow: hidden} .mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite {line-height: 1em; text-align: left; padding-left: 2em; margin- Top: 0} .mw-parser-output .templatequote .TemplateQuotecite cite {font-size: small}\nChristians believe that their beliefs are good, but other faith are harmful. In any case, they also hold this view in the communist beliefs. I insist that all faith is harmful. We can define \"belief\" as a firm belief that there is no evidence. There are evidence, no one will say \"faith\". We don't say \"2 plus 2 is equal to 4\" is faith, and \"the earth is round\" is a belief. We only talk about faith when you want to use emotions. It is easy to cause conflicts with emotions, because different groups are replaced with different emotions. Christian believes in the resurrection of Jesus, the Communists believe in Marx 's value. Any of the beliefs cannot be rationally supported. Therefore, each belief has to be maintained by propaganda, and it has to pass the war if necessary. - Will Religious Faith Cure Our Troubles?\nPhilosopher Valter Arnold Cavman in his book \"The Faith of A Heretic\" defined as: a strong belief, usually expressed as the lack of sufficient evidence, can not convince every rational person's entry Trust [9].\nEvolutionary Biologist Richard Daokins criticized all the beliefs that he thinks with scientific evidence in his work \"God Illustration\". Educating children \"belief itself is a virtue\" point of view, actually is truly harmful practices. The reason why belief is especially because it does not need a reason, it does not need to argue. Irrush into the children \"Don't have a trusted faith is a virtue\", which may make them grow up to become the potential fatal weapon of the future, the Crusaders, especially in the influence of certain factors that are not difficult [10 ]. He described belief as a blind letter that has no evidence, an active process of not thinking. He pointed out that this approach will only make anyone only with personal thoughts and possible distorted perception (no need to test naturally); this approach, reducing our understanding of the natural world, There is no ability to make reliable and consistent predictions, and there is no need to comment. [11]\n1979 Nobel Physics Award Winner Steven Winberg warned people, the world needs to wake up from a long religious belief; for our scientists, anything that can be done to weaken religious beliefs should be done. In fact, this may be our greatest contribution to civilization. Religion is a cheating than profit. [12] Leg him also believes that no matter whether there is any religion, a good person will do a good job, the bad people will make a bad thing. However, if you want a good person to be a bad thing, you need a religion.

The historical period of religion is approximately 5,200 years ago (3,200 BC) starts with the inventions of the text. The prehistoric religion involves the study of religious beliefs before writing.\nToday, the word \"religion\" (English: Religion) in the Western sense, there is no obvious pre-colonial vocabulary in the non-European language outside the West. Daniel Dubson (French: Daniel Dubuisson) wrote: [1] \"Western and Religious History later in\" religion \"concept is very unique, it may only be suitable for yourself and your own History. \"Other cultures have the history of interaction in religious category, which is the interaction between the concepts of Europe's only developed in Europe [2].\n\ntable of Contents\n\n1 religious origin\n2 religious development\n\n2.1 axial era\n2.2 Medieval\n2.3 Modern\n\n\n3 major religious history\n4 See\n5 Reference\n\n\nReligious origin [edit]\nSee: Original Religion\n Prehistoric lion people statue (about 30,000 years ago)\nThe earliest evidence of religious thinking dates back to the mid-term and late in the old stone age. Archaeologists mentioned that the burial behavior of early wise people was the evidence of religious concepts as early as 300,000 years ago. Other evidence includes symbolic cultural relics from the mid-African old stone era. However, there is still controversial for the interpretation of the end of the old stone era.\nMore than the nearby archaeological evidence is less disputed, some cultural relics in the old stone era (50,000 - 13,000 BC) are usually considered by scientists to represent religious concepts. Examples of the late-state and religious beliefs include prehistoric lion people, Venorf Venus, Shawvan Cave, and Cardiy Ceremony in the Somir region.\nThe ancient Egyptian pyramid (English: Pyramid Texts) is one of the oldest religious classics in the world, approximately 2400-2300 BC [3] [4]. The text has played an important role in maintaining organized religions, and religious concepts are regulated regardless of time or locations.\n\nReligion development [edit]\nAxis era [edit]\nMain entry: axial century\nGerman philosopher Carl Yaspez is called the \"axial era\" from 900 years to the first 200 years before the history of human history. For this historical era, Yaspez said: \"The spirit of human spirit is simultaneously and independently ... and these remain the foundation of today's human beings.\" Peter Watson will summarize this period as Many of the most influential philosophical traditions of human beings, including Persian and Canaan's aid, Greece Plato, India's Jain and Buddhism, and Chinese Confucian and Taoism.\nThe historical roots of Indian Jain teaches to be traced back to the 9th century BC, with the rise of the Bar wettop, the rise of the English: Parshvanatha, and his non-violent philosophy [5] [6].\n\nMedieval [edit]\nThe main religion of contemporary world began in Eurasia, including: the Christianity of the Western world; Buddhism to East Asia's decline and the decline of the Indian sub-continent; and Islam throughout the Middle East, Central Asia, India, North Africa and some European spread.\nThe conflicts between multiple different religions occurred throughout the Middle Ages. Islamic conquered Persian, Muslims conflict with Zhurus. Arabian - Byzantine War, Cross Army, Follow the Land, Byzantine - Osman War, Christians and Muslims Conflicts; Shaman During the Mongolian battle, with Buddhists, Taoists, Muslims and Christians have conflicts; Muslim conquer India During the conflict with Hindis and Sikh.\nMany medieval religious movements emphasize mysterious, such as Christian Carterry and related sports, Spain's Jewish Mystery (Kabara), Hindu, Essence (English: Bhakti Movement) and Islam Sophie. A God has formed a clear form in Christ Christ Christ and Islam. The non-secondnate of Hindu also reached classical forms under the teachings of Adi Ji Luo.\n\nModern [edit]\n World main religious distribution map\nThe invention of the 15th century printed, played an important role in the rapid communication of religious reforms such as Martin Luther and John Galvin. The conflict of new education and the old teaching has evolved into a 30-year war in Europe in 1618 to 1648. From the 15th to the 19th century, due to the geographical discovery of Europeans, colonialism and new and old-tech conflict, Christianity spread to Saharan Africa, America, Far East and Australia. After the 18th century, especially after the French Revolution, Europe gradually became secular. From the end of the 20th century, the religious beliefs in most parts of Europe declined.\nIn the 20th century, communism in Eastern Europe and China's regime is anti-religion. There is also a wave of emerging religious movements in the 20th century, integrating many different religious elements. However, in 2000, the population of global tribute is limited (<2%). Classical world religion believers account for more than 75% of the world's population, while indigenous tribal religions fell to 4%. As of 2005, 14% of the world's population is estimated to have no religion.\n\nMain religious history [edit]\nJewish - Jewish history\nIslam - Islamic History\nChristian - Christian history\nHindu - Hindu History\nChinese Religious History\nBuddhism - Buddhist history\nTaoism - Taoist history\nFolk religion\nShaman belief\nnon-religious\nSee [edit]\nReligious annual table\nWorld religion\nReligious war\nPolitical separation\nReligious history\nEvolution of religion\nPolitical Science and Religion (English: Political Science Of Religion)\nReference [edit]\n\n\n^ Daniel Dubuisson.

The topics of religious philosophy include: God's presence or absence, God's attributes, religious and scientific associations, religion and morality, good and evil nature [1].\nReligious philosophy and religious philosophy have different philosophies, and the former is standing outside of religion. Therefore, people who study religious philosophy don't need any religious beliefs.\n\ntable of Contents\n\n1nd\n\n1.1 God's essence\n1.2 God's existence\n\n1.2.1 Argumentation of God\n1.2.2 Detecting of God does not exist\n\n\n\n\n2 religious and science\n\n2.1 compatibility\n2.2 does not compatibility\n\n\n3 religious and morality\n4 reference\n5 See\n\n\nGod [edit]\nGod's nature [edit]\nReligious philosophers have more research on God's essence, similar propositions are:\n\nWhat is God?\nGod is a (one title) or multiple (multidist theory)? In this regard, the ancient Greek philosopher Plato once thought that people should believe in a perfect until the God of God; this is a point of view that tends to be the title.\nWhat is the character of God?\nIs God or the universe?\nThe above proposition is derived from countless related philosophical thinking and paradox. For example, about several characteristics that are often used to describe a single god of Christian, will have the following related thinking:\nAll known - The Lord is often considered to be a whole, but this character threatens the freedom of humans. Suppose God is a whole, then he will inevitably know what someone will do (for example, a particular event is completed). Once God knows that someone will complete the event in the future, this person will definitely do this, because God is \"all\", so it will not be checked. However, if the human beings are free to conscious, can this person can't choose to avoid the event? Considering the recognition of God's titles, this person's free will cannot do any impact on the development of future incidents, then deny that humans have free will. So God's \"titled\" and human \"freedom will\" are contrary.\nYing Shi - The Lord is generally considered eternal, and his existence has not ended. So, there is no \"past, now and future\"? Or is God existing outside? If God is in time, God should change due to time, and how can I be eternal? If God exists in time, how do he have any exchanges in the time? Is there anything that can exist outside time?\nCharity - Is the goodness of the LORD and human understanding? The reason why good things is because God specifies that they are good, or because they are so good, God has stipulated that they are good? God is charity because he is only a charity, because no matter what he does is charity? [2] See the Watcuple Flan Distress.\n\nGod's existence [edit]\n Ancient Greek philosophers, Aristotle, proposed the concept of \"Mounted Punker\"\nMain entry: God's existence\nOne of the main topics of religious philosophy is to inference whether God exists. On this issue, many well-known philosophers have elaborated their opinions. For example, ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle has proposed that every sports object has its due fact. If we trace the causal association between objects, we will inevitably find a \"non-moving actor (English: unmoved mover\", which is the beginning of all sports or the first athlete. And this is God. [3] The following is a few famous demonstrations in the religious philosophy.\n\nThe argumentation of God [edit]\nFirst Cause Theory - Thomas Aquari, in his \"five ways\", there are some things in the world. And the consequences must have their own due practice. But these precursors will have his own cause. If we trace the cause, we will definitely find the \"first reason\", and the causal relationship cannot be unlimited. This \"first reason\" itself does not have a cause, but it is the cause of all things, and it is God. [4]\nThe ontology proves - the subject matter proves that the most famous version is proposed by philosophers. God was defined as \"A Being Than Which No Greater Can Be Conceived). If this thing does not exist, then this definition is wrong, because there is more great thing than this thing (a presence of God). So, the greatest thing in the world must exist. Because God is the greatest, he must exist. [5]\nDesign Argument - Argument from Design, also known as the TEELogical Argument. Design argument tries to launch God from the appearance of the natural world: there is a lot of things in nature seem to have been designed, such as providing visual eyes. If these things are designed, it must have a designer's existence. This designer is God. [6]\nPasca's bet - Blazuse Pasca proposed: Suppose people do bet on God's presence, then a sensible person should gamble God is existence. If God does not exist, no matter what you gambling God exist or don't exist, you will not have much loss. But if God exists, you gamble God, then you can get permanent happiness. Instead, if you gamble God does not exist in this case, you will pay a considerable price. So the people who are sensible will believe in the existence of God. [7]\nThe argumentation of God [edit]\n Philosopher Leibniz has tried to solve the problem of sin\nSin issue - God's existence and evil existence look contradictory. If a perfect God exists, he will be a whole known, all-round and full. If God is all-round, he has the ability to eliminate evil. If God is a whole, he knows the existence of evil. If God is full, he will want to eliminate evil. However, evil has always existed. If the evil and God exists, then (1) God is not a whole or (2) God is not a whole world or (3) God is not full. But God is necessarily all known, all-round and full. So God does not exist. [8]\nReligion and Science [edit]\nOverall, scientific is committed to studying the world that can be observed, and religion involves non-substances, unable to use the sensory to directly notice. History, science and religion have lived peace. In today's scientific, a religious philosopher believes that religion and science are incompatible, and the other party believes that science and religion are two separate areas and do not affect each other. [9]\n\nCompatible [edit]\nMany great scientists in history, such as Newton, Descartes, Cartier and Bacon are compatible supporters. Compatible the alarm division. A distribution believes that scientific research can make people learn more about the natural world created by God. The more you understand the mystery of the natural world, the more you can experience God's greatness and universal.\nAnother faction of compatibility believes that science and religion are two areas of interference. Scientific research is the natural world, and religion involves non-material world. Since both research areas are completely different, then there will be no contradictions and conflicts.\n\nNon-compatibility [edit]\nIncompatient thinks that science and religion are not able to be correct at the same time. If the religious belief is correct, that scientific is wrong. And if the science is correct, the religious belief is wrong. Does notachaists often raise evolution as an example. If the evolution is correct, the God of the Abraham, which is said to the God's deeds will definitely be wrong.\n\nReligion and morality [edit]\nReference [edit]\n\n\n^ Stanford University Philosophical Encyclopedia Religious Philosophy (Page Archive Backup, Save Internet Archives) (English)\n\nThe concept of the Philosophy of Stanford University (English).

Jewish inherited his father, in order to protect the customs of the kingdom; Christian inherited humanity, with no deliberation transcending death; worshiping inherited the animal, creating a real monk model (Jewish and Christianity only have a \"business\" and \"form\", even Jewish The three gods are all split), and the ancestors have reincarnation, and even don't believe in the existence of God, because of this, he is extremely desperate, and it is extremely arrogant, and willing to \"complete human body\" Challenge the sinking will of the universe, so the bald eagle and the philosophers sitting on the top (Faraha), which represent the human rights of human beings over all natural laws. Nietzsche's argument and superman said the system has been established, so that the US ultimate realism is because of his extremely light, it is directly or indirectly promoting the gods of Hitra, Nazi Party's race cleaning of Jewish cold blood. [Source Request]\nIn another point of view, the so-called \"God's appearance\", \"God's work\", it is only the human subconsciousness to refuse to carry a sense of confense and guilt, refuse to \"all things will eventually die\", with the group tacit pair The knowledge of Tacit Knowledge, Nietzsche said \"God has died\" is not just a negation of spiritualism, but hints that there will be self-evolving in the future, and no one has done it. The behavioral mode \", and the truly power will will lead to the eternal life of the whole wisdom. [Source Request]\nHowever, when he learned that the soil's unreasonable military competition, the unreasonable hatred of Shavouism, he had premonmed the familiar world will become a human purgatory, and he is completely crazy in the endless remode. And coincidentally, on April 20, the same year, Aldf Hitra, this completely born, completely excluding God's anti-hero (Anti-Hero), and he has experienced in a prisoner in Munich's coup. \"Tracing Stella is saying\" the \"spiritual three-changing\" concept described, completely understanding the super-consciousness of Jacob and God, and breaks relief of the reality of the world, and opens up the mortal self-finance. Road, and \"Human Destiny: Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomo\" Homo Deus Evolution Blueprint is somewhat by Hitra's pessimism ( Pessimistic Heroism, refers to the anti-hero never thinks that the world has a future, just to fight against the virtual and unreasonable and survived). [Source Request]\nBecause of this, \"God\" genetically bundled will inevitably appear, whether cognitive simulation, logical inorganic (integral awareness of the humanized network), or inverse logic, knowledge-based organic (complete deactivation, surpassing artificial intelligence) The form of a wise man, and that ideal \"beautiful new world\" must be extremely cruel, because when human beings are screened, it will only be completely lost after destroying these full-class intelligent flow-water humans. Humanity, only \"always live\", there is labor, and in that future, human free will gradually lost, Personality Instrumentalized, becoming the production tools operated by \"God\", and human beings unconscious The induction of China's hidden induced human or movies in 2000, such as 2013 \"I can't get it\" (HER), \"intelligent rebels\" (Ex numberina). The cruelty is that if human beings can't control artificial intelligence, this \"beautiful new world\" will naturally arrive, which is the \"God\", and this god is unrequited, only pedestrians can't understand Killing. [Source Request]\n\nDeadization [edit]\nDeceit\nThe deception process believes that God's concept originated from the primitive social period, the point of view believed that \"God\" was established by people, and all human rights could not be able to be deactivated. \"God\" is originally derived from the gods. With the social structure and cultural development, the image of God, the number of God's body and the number of gods have gradually changed, and the simple object god is converted to complication; by the gods, evolving into one It is a high-level or multi-tier class of a high-level or multi-tier class; it is also spread to the world, and the national or even widespread worldwide is converted to a deminination.\n\nmaterialize\nWith the development of society, people have the image of God, fear, fear and love, and then only a spiritual image; modern society, many things that are considered impossible, human beings have successfully realized, people have no fear God has become not terrible, and the existence of God has begun to be questioned, and some people began to become substanceism by beliefism, and some people have materialized or functionalized to God. From the field of aesthetics, philosophy, psychology, such development, \"humanity\" becomes \"inspection\" or \"definition\", \"complex\" is more difficult to be more difficult or defined, entering self-significance \"Unlimited Back\" phenomenon. Humanity is generally more embarrassed, uneasy, and there is no goal in the future.\n\nGod's image [edit]\nNature God [edit]\nNatural God stems from the later period of the original society, will not be able to resist natural body, naturally evolve into God, in the early days of the worship, direct natural body, such as fire, thunder, water, solar, etc., think that they are itself With will and life, and even even deactivate animal plants, as people have an abstract ability, the concept of Shenling is independent of the natural object gradually born.\n\nSociety [edit]\nSocial god will social phenomenon or strength, from the later period of primitive society, is the evolution of natural gods, with the development of productivity and complex, classization, people are no longer a single individual, social power It is also considered to be unacuised and unacceptable, such as God of War, Love God, God, Regional Guardian, Industry God, etc.\nSociety God has a variety of branches, can be divided into two categories: the first category is related to his own innate status (clan), can be called the clan; the second class is related to its own original identity (such as the industry), in this class The main thing is the industry god.\n\nBranch of social god [edit]\nZongzhen, related to his own clan.\nFamily god is the home of the family, usually for the ancestors of this home, the letter believes that the ancestors have become God, guarding the peace of the family and the peace of the family, and in this respect, it is a class of tribal gods, however The home god also has the functions of family division and the uniqueness of the family, and the different tribes is that the gods are small and returned.\nTribal GOD is related to the origin of tribe or tribe.

There are two main types, the first kind of religion of ancient Egypt is a semi-propagander transition period, the head is an animal, and the body is the people's gods, and the God of the full spirit is the most pleasant in ancient Greece and ancient Rome. , The gods in Zeus's gods have a human life.\n\nAbstract god [edit]\nAbstract God can refer to Jewish and Islam in the god of abstravation. Islam prohibits the imaging and \u62dc \u50cf, e.g., ancient China's concept of \"God\" is quite abstract, almost unmanned and omnipotent.\n\nGod's body [edit]\nNo God [edit]\nMain entry: no theory\nSee: Basic Consensus of Buddhism and Mahayana Buddhism\nAnonymists think that any god does not exist, such as supporters Marx.\nIn 1982, the Ven. Walpola Rahula provides a re-explanation and comes, and it is believed that \"Whether it is the Buddhist Buddhism or the Mahayana Buddhism, we don't believe this world is created by God and his will. Governance. \"\n\nInappropriate [edit]\nMain entry: inevitable\nUnfair people think that God is unknown or impossible to thoroughly understand, and is criticized by theologist. Although the letter and unfinity have not enough reasons, but the doubts of thought is represented by affirmative religion.\n\nNaturalism [edit]\nMain entry: naturalism\nSee: Brahmanism\nNaturalist claims that after God created, complete its mission, let the universe developed, and the earliest year of Christian Soxini proposed that in the Voltaic and Rousseau era, it is now micro.\n\nPan God [edit]\nMain entry: Pan God\nThe Pan God believes that God is natural, mysterious pan God believes that God is in a natural world, in short, people are a part of God, and natural pan the gods believe that nature is a way of God, in some cases, in some cases Tong, the philosopher Stunos Sand has established the most complete one.\n\nPan nature [edit]\nMain entry: Pan naturalism\nPan naturalism is a philosophical point of view of naturalism and pan the god. This point of view believes that God will incurred his own body after creating the rules of the universe and its existence. The universe and the world.\n\nInternalism [edit]\nIMMANENCE believes that God is unlikely, with super in theory, emphasizing God's innerness, emphasizing God's quiet, cycle, business (historical view), also emphasize God's mystery and non-non- Personality (Dead), seen in Buddhism's universe order, Indian chistler, Egypt, etc., the most of the people, the original religion.\n\nSuper in the next thing [edit]\nThe transcendentalism believes that God is surpassed or independent of the world, compared with the inner disclosure of the gods to the world's external, transcendence, emphasizing the enthusiasm of God, is the ultimate pointing (historical view) of history (historical view), Also emphasizes God's rationality and personality (decentness), exists in Jewish, the theory of Islam, the teachings, and the Nos.\n\nUltra-pop-up [edit]\nSuper Pofementism (PANENTHEISM) Comprehensive super in the ones and inner theory, thinking that God is itself, and there is a super-existing root base, while existing in the existence of itself is intrinsic, God is both super It is also inherent, a tendency to modern Christianology.\n\nThe quantity of God [edit]\nAttentive religion [edit]\nI don't believe that there is a high ghost, such as Buddhism believes there are all kinds of ghosts in the universe, but denying all the supreme gods, thinking that all ghosts are treated by the fruit, the Law, such as the Sandy, Leier sect, such as emerging religions It is believed that the God of traditional religion is actually a higher alien.\n\nMulti-god education [edit]\nMulti-god education begins in the later stage of the primitive society, believes in the existence of many gods, such as the main industry, the main region, the main region, and the worship can choose different gods with different situations and need to choose different gods. Multi-gods, the gods often have a class, usually have the highest primary god, and other have their own relationships.\n\nRotor to change the primary god education [edit]\nRotation of primary gods (Kathenotheism) is also called alternating primary god education, with multi-gods, the position of the main gods has not been fixed, and the primary god changes with regional or time. For example, Hindu is born in Brahma, a pivot slave, and a wet husband, like the Greek Zeus, Athena, Apollo, some Huang Emperor in the faith in some Chinese people also has a rotation concept. [4] [5]\n\nSingle master god [edit]\nA single masterpiece has a multi-god of fixed principles, a transition formation of many gods to a god. A single masterpiece is not necessarily to go to a god, such as Confucianism, and Japan.\n\nBinary god [edit]\nDualistic Religion believes that there are two opposite gods, and only good god will be selected as worship, including teaching, Nos, Moist education, etc.\n\nA god education [edit]\nA god is mainly produced in the nomadic society (Example: ancient Jewish), the most typical and famous is Abraham: Jewish, Christ, Islam.\nThere is only one of the only true gods, or \"God\", \"Father\", \"Father\", \"The Lord,\" Creator \", etc., there is often no picture, so it usually opposes idol worship, other million The authority comes from Him, and a god is not denying other spirits, such as angels, devils, etc., but they are only being created (God created) rather than creators, so non-\"true god\", and non-worship. For the respect of the only true God, it should be made separately from other spirits to avoid.\nIn Christ's religious doctrine, Jesus Christ believes as God. It is said that Jesus is a fishery (the Tao is the sacred words of God). It is a child who is in the Holy Spiritual Mary, is the Son of the Father, and the same. The two of the gods of God, that is, \"the Father, Son, the Holy Spirit\". The three of Christ religion said that in an ancient world, it succeeded in the world, but conflicts with Jewish and Islam.\nJewish and Islamic respect for the respect of the prophet, unless the worship of God, that is, the prophetism in humans, such as Jewish Moses is not God, Islamic Muhammad is not God, can only say that God's messenger, spokesperson.\n\nGod of religion [edit]\nConfucianism, Taoism, China Faith [edit]\nMain entry: Shenxian and Taoism\nConfucian Zhou Li divided the gods and genitals of God into God, and only three categories.\nThe highest level is God, including all the gods in the sky, which is the highest god (also known as the emperor, God, the emperor, God, the emperor, the old man), and the Taoism is called the Yu emperor God; his jurisdiction of the gods have a nation, The god of the moon, the god of the stars, the windmaster, etc.\nSecondly, the land is only the first, and the land gods, the gods, the national society, the township, etc., and the gods, rivers, animal and plant gods, and even the gods, the landlord, the gods, the gods, the gods and so on.

Even if you are a distinguished man, when you have a life, you will have a \"heavenly five decline\", and then fall into the wheel.\nBuddhism has denied other religions to control the natural creation of nature and the destruction of the world and the gods that can be interacted with human interaction and completely. Buddhism only believes that ghosts are very energyful, big blessings, and the life is very long, but there is no point to reach other religions, thinking that as long as it is good, it is not necessarily the sacrifice, it may become the other ghosts and ghosts, etc., worship ghosts Buddhism has defined similar ancestors worship, and believes that the god of other religions may be a senior heaven (such as a god of god, he has said that he is a saying of Tianshi, and there is also a statement of the sky, but not Buddha, still in the triple turn. There are many understandings for the definition of the idiotism. If it is opposed to all the gods, Buddhism is believed to believe the gods, but it is not worthpassing; if it is against the gods with the crew and the master, Buddhism can also be called it. The opposite side \"no the theory\". In 1982, Huaku Luo Rong Luo (English: Walpola Rahula Thero) believes: \"Whether it is the upper part of Buddhism or Mahaya Buddhism, we don't believe that this world is created and governed by God and his will.\"\nBuddhism advocates that all sentient beings have been in turn around, and reach the nirvanual realm of the people who are not indispensable. This is no longer in the reincarnation, and it doesn't matter if it is hard or not. These ghosts are also sentient beings. It is the object of Buddhism to teach cultural practice, and Buddhism believes that after the Same of many princes become Buddhas to Sakyamuni Buddha, heavenly ghosts all respect him for the top Tienie, the world, and in Buddhism. In the process of development, always accompanied the navigation of ghosts, He is called the ghosts and ghosts. There are two kinds of objects in Buddhism, one is to protect the ghosts, express tribute and gratitude to them, the other is the Buddha, Big Buddha, Arra Han, the Buddha, etc., the Buddha, etc., or their avatar (such as Maitreya Buddha). The avatar bag monk), these saints are the objects that should have, and should be a teacher, not worship, ask for bless, utilitarian objects.\nIn addition to the history of Sakyamuni Buddha, Alo Han and a few well-known monks, usually in the Han Bi Buddhism or Mahayan Buddhism is a Buddha, they are all human heroes and saints, so,, Buddhism is mainly a great man. Shengxian. The Buddha is the first respetence of the world. Although the Buddha, Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, but has been repaired by the body to be super-life and rescue, and Buddhism will deliver the Buddha in the three Buddhas. And reporting the Buddha, actually equivalent to abstract god and social god.\n\nHinduism [edit]\nMain entry: Brahma and Teven\nThe predecessor of Hindu is Brairon, is a class of multi-gods. Among them, there are three major primary gods, wet women, Brahma, and a wet slave.\n\"Brahma\" is also known as \"Brahman\", is the first God of the three major God: It is created a universe. As with Jewish, there is only one temple for Brachnya in India.\n\nGod's characteristics [edit]\nMulti-god education and deception [edit]\nMain entry: multi-god\nMain entry: Demination\nSome gods' beliefs (such as the teaching), God can be a hero or the sage when it is alive or dead, but it is not necessarily named by the name of the gods, for example, called fairy.\nIn Greek mythology, God's personality and people are similar.\n\nA god education [edit]\nMain entry: a god\nA god is thinking that there is only one of the gods that enclose everything, and there is also a variety of angels and devils in the existence of \"God\".\nBut this does not mean that it is absolutely denied that the first sages are refused to be excessive emperor, which is usually called a prophet or a saint.\n\nZushu worship [edit]\nMain entry: Zum Ling worship\nThe \"God\" in the ancestors is the soul of the ancestors, and the ancestors worship believes that the ancestors' soul still exist, and will still affect the world, and have an impact on the survival status of the children [6].\n\nPan God [edit]\nMain entry: Pan God\nPanner believes that \"God\" exists in all things in nature, there is no additional supernatural domain or spiritual power. Since the 16th century, this point of view is represented by the characters with Bruno, Sinoa, Einstein.\n\nPolitical teachion [edit]\nMain entry: Political teach\nThe political integration one refers to integrating \"political\" power and \"religion\" strength. For example, the Chinese will call the emperor to the emperor. It is the spokesperson of God, which has a gods; the West has passed the same concept. At present, Iran and Van Ganoa are a few countries in which a minority is a country.\n\nNo God [edit]\nMain entry: no theory\nThe idiotist thinks that \"God\" does not exist [7]. Another point of view of some unsoters is: 'The world consists of material, and if there is no material as a dependence, the spirit is no way to exist.

(discuss)\n Female and Fuxi\n\n\nMythical theme\nIn folklore, myth is a sacred story about human and world changes. [1] In general, \"myth\" can refer to any ancient legend, [2] express the national ideology by the form of the story. [3]\nMyth origin is from the primitive social period, and humans explain the natural phenomena through reasoning and imagination. However, since the knowledge level is very low, it is often covered with a mysterious color.\nMost of mythology is mostly superman's strength, the idealization of the understanding and wishes of the original humans.\nThe history of the primitive society of many nations is starting from mythological stories. Most of the characters in myths come from the original human figure. The hunting is relatively developed, most myths are related to hunting; the myths created by farming and developed tribes are involved in agriculture. The hero in myth is also a knife ax, the bow is a weapon. From mythology, you can see some of the people's deeds.\nWhether it is the original social nation in the earliest area of \u200b\u200bworld civilization, it is still in the nation of the primitive society in the world, and many myths they have spread are similar.\nMyth is also the primary river of literature, and it is the earliest oral essay work. For example, \"Zhuangzi \u00b7 Emperor\" said: \"Thailand, his is awkward, and it is true, one is a horse, one is a cattle.\"\nMyths have certain geographical and regional, different civilizations or nations have my own myth meanings [4].\n\ntable of Contents\n\n1 definition\n2 classification\n3 understanding of mythology\n4 origin\n\n4.1 Real Events\n4.2 Fables\n4.3 \u4eba\n4.4 Myths - Ceremony Theory\n\n\n5 purpose\n6 World Mythology\n7 more mythology\n8 fictional mythology\n9 reference\n\n9.1 Reference\n9.2 source\n\n\n10 external connection\n11 See\n\n\nDefinition [edit]\nIn academic, scholars must have a few conditions:\n\nNarrative a single event or story in the initial period of human evolution or human evolution. [5] [6] [7]\nThe adults must believe that the story is trustworthy. [5] [6] [8] [9] The inheritor knows that it is a fictional story is called \"fable\". [10]\nIt must be a collective creation of an ancient ethnic group and stream. If it is a personal creation, and there is no participation through the inheritance and the members of the masses, this story is not a myth. [5]\nAnd mythical concepts have legends and folk stories. These three words refer to different types of traditional stories. [11] Unlike myths, folk stories can happen in any time, any location; people inheriting folk stories do not treat them as real, sacred. [5] The legend is generally used as true, but the legend is generally happening within the closer event segment, the legendary world is almost the same. [5] The protagonist of the legend is generally human, mythically protagonist is generally supernatural roles. [5]\nThe three concepts of define myths, legends and folk stories, just to classify traditional stories. [12] In many cultures, there must be a clear boundary between myths and legends. [13] Some cultures only divide the traditional story into two categories: folk stories and myths. [14] Even myths and folk stories can not be completely distinguished, a nation thinks is a fictional story (folk story), may be regarded as a historical fact of another nation (myth).\n[15] [16] In fact, after a myth is lost, it is more like a folk story, such as the previous European giant, the fairy and human heroes have the gods, and it is a folk story after the Christian propagation. . [6]\n\nClassification [edit]\nMyth is roughly divided into three categories: creation myth, God's myth, hero myth. Among them, it is most important to create myth.\n\nCreating myths - telling the myth of human original period, documenting business, and institutional origins. It can also be coarsely divided into the myth of the world, the myth of human origin, and the myth of cultural origin.\nBut not to mention that every nation will have the above types, and some nationalities may talk about human origins, but they did not say the origin of cultural, but in this way, they can still summarize a common point, that is, the \"universe start\" Evolution to \"Order Rules\".\n\nGod's mythology and hero myths - is to tell the deeds of god Buddha and heroes.\nDifferent academic scope of understanding of myths [edit]\n The Nordic's gods will be old and dead, and it is responsible for the goddess of the gods to make the gods of the magic apple. Image by J. Penrose, 1890.\nThe word myth in English comes from the word Mythos, Greek, and its original text includes \"words\", \"words\", \"story\" and \"fictional story / novel\", etc .; due to its invalidity And often with the \"Road / Science\" (LOGOS) in Greece, in modern academic research, myths are often not \"false stories\", \"misunderstanding\" synonyms, in different academic research, \"myth\" term Three main uses, namely etiquette / human learning, literary usage and symbolic learning:\n\nEtiquette / human learning is a narrative of anonymous creation. It provides the world why is this now and people explain this, it is an important means to naturally become cultural, it is human trial to self-identity. An explanation, there is a cultural meaning among them.\nIn the literary theory, myth is a story or symbol of a certain eternal human truth. This eternal truth is usually a moral or aesthetic category, which has a symbolic or prototype has a cross-cultural meaning. Religion and literature have an extremely similar social function, which is to transmit this eternal truth value through the form of a story.\nSymbolics's understanding of mythology is different, it refers to a series of connected and unforgettable related concepts. The members in some cultures can understand some of the important themes for humans, myths are unconscious. Working with the body of the body to make cultural nature.\nOrigin [edit]\nReal event [edit]\nOne theory believes that myth is evolved from a real historical event. [17] [18] According to this theory, the ancient story of the ancient story has repeatedly described a history, and the characters in the story are gratiate. [17] [18] For example, some scholars believe that the myth of Fengshen, the myth of Russia is from an ancient real king. He teaches people to use sailboats, master the skill, and later spread into Fengshen. [17] Zeus is a broad king and is buried after death in Crete. [19] The ancient Greek writer in the 5th century BC He has supported this claim. [18] Greek mythologist Jishi Ros (ancient Greek: \u1f50\u03ae \u1f50\u03ae \u1f50\u03ae\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 [Euh\u0113eros], born in the first 4th century) is the most famous person who holds this theory, this kind of thought is also known as \"Jishi Ros) \". [18] [20]\n\nFable [edit]\nSome people think that myth comes from the palm. For example, the ancient Greek gods look at the interpretation and metaphor of natural phenomena, representing the sun, Puerton represents water. [18] Similar theories believe that myth is the carrier of philosophical or spiritual concept: Attendant represents wisdom and fair, representatives of Aphrodite represent the desire. [18] The 19th century Sanskan scholar Max Miler supports mythical trapping theory. He believes that myth is originally a metaphorical description of nature, and later gradually be understood by literally. For example, people often use rhetorical techniques to describe the sea \"restlessness\", and later the bodies in myths are described as violent. [twenty one]\n\n\u4eba \u5316 [edit]\nSome scholars believe that myth is the proposed manification of lifeless objects and strength. For example, the ancients worship fire, air is natural, and then gradually imagine them into gods. This theory is called \"mythopoeic thought). [22] According to this theory, the ancients often see people with no life as subjective people. [23] Therefore, they describe the natural events as the god people, these gods often have human character. These stories have formed a myth. [twenty four]\n\nMyths - Ceremony Theory [edit]\nAccording to myths - ritual theory, all the myths and ceremonies are inseparable. [25] The most extreme, all myths are the explanation of early humans on ceremonies. [26] This theory was earliered by the Bible scholar William Smith. [27] According to Smith's theory, people have nothing to do with the original ceremony and myth. Later, we forgot the original reason, try to edit some stories to explain the ceremony, and claim that the ceremony is to commemorate the incidents described in myths. [28] Anthropologist James Fraser also holds similar theory. He believes that the primitive people fell to magic, and later people lost their confidence in magic, invented my words, and said that they held the religious ceremony of the magic ceremony for appealing the gods. [29]\n\nDestination [edit]\nSome religious historians believe that one of the most important functions of myth is to build behavioral modes [30] and provide religious experience. [31] Through each other, members of the traditional society temporarily separate themselves and the current world, let the soul return to myths, thus making them more close to the sacred world. [8] [30] [32]\nIn some cases, the society will try to reproduce the scene in myth when review myth. For example, people will reproduce God's cure means used in creation, hoping to cure people who are currently sick. [33] Roland Bart also agreed with this point. He believes that modern culture also makes similar things. Due to science unable to define human morality, people still have access to a more aftern era by religious experience. Those ancient times have higher moral standards in people's minds, and the current technology era is completely different. [34]\nThe religger Joseph Campbell Defines the Myths There are four basic functions: mysterious function (make people feel the universe), scientific function (explaining the world operation mode), sociological function (support and verify social order), education function (explain humanity How to live under various conditions). [35]\nIn a culture, myths usually play four functions [36]:\n1. Digital function: can be used to explain the root cause\n2. The function of the universe: emphasizing that all things in the universe are part of a large picture\n3. Social function: Promote members of members of social norms through myths\n4. Psychological function: provide a model of personal behavior\n\nWorld myth [edit]\nFor details, please refer to mythist list, the following is listed below.\n\nChinese myth\nJapanese mythology\nKorean mythology\nVietnamese mythology\nMongolian myth\nIndian myth\nBabylon mythology\nNordic myth\nRoman mythology\nGreek mythology\nSlavic mythology\nMayan myth\nAztke myth\nEgyptian mythology\nMaori Mythology\n Tianzhao Dawei (\u30de\u30c6 \u30de\u30c6 \u30aa\u30aa\u30df \u30aa\u30aa\u30df \u30df), the goddess of the Japanese mythology.\n Indian myth goddess time.\nCompare mythology [edit]\nCompare mythology refers to comparing different myths to identify their common topics and characteristics, or the myths branches with the system, such as Mongol's myths and Turkic myths, the origins of the two are \u53e4aluna, maybe because It is produced by the nomads to communicate or separate from each other.\nPlease refer to comparative mythology for details.\n\nFictional myth [edit]\nMain entry: Fictional myth (English: mythopoeia)\nKessu mythology\n\nReference [edit]\nQuote [edit]\n\n\n^ Dundes, Introduction, P. 1\n\n^ Kirk, \"defining\", p. 57; kirk, myth, p. 74; sImpson, p. 3\n\n^ Lincoln, Bruce An Early Moment in the Discourse of \"Terrorism\":.

[1]\nArchitecture, in a broad sense, is a discipline studying architecture and its environment.\nUnder normal circumstances, as well as the original meaning as a foreign language (from Europe to Japan to China), it is more integrated with art and technology related to building design and construction. Therefore, architecture is a discipline across engineering technology and human art. Architecture art and construction technology involved, as well as construction arts as practical arts, including the practical, functional side and art, aesthetics, although there is a clear different but closely, and its parts are The specific situation is different from the building. It may be very strong and the rest in some buildings, but the situation in other buildings may be different.\nIn a narrow sense, it is a series of issues that can be appreciated by the space for appreciation of buildings, and how to establish, adjust the beautification, etc.\nIn fact, the objects studied by \"architecture\" as a special word are not only the building itself, but also the research on the requirements of the building and how to satisfy it, and research the building entities from the inconsistent process.

The current general civil work items include: energy, water conservancy and transportation facilities. In the past, all non-military useful civil engineering projects have been classified into this category, but as engineering science is increasing, there are many contents that are the scope of civil engineering have been independent.\nThe civil engineering is the purpose of improving the quality of the national life, promoting the public well-being of the nationals, and then transforming the land, rectifying the environment and the prevention of disasters. It is also related to the four major needs of the food in the country, and is closely related to the well-being of the nationals. Therefore, the civil engineering is also directly or indirectly solving the fundamental construction projects of the people's livelihood.\n\ntable of Contents\n\n1 history\n\nAncient\n1.2 modern\n1.3 modern\n\n\n2 branch\n\n2.1 Engineering Measurement\n2.2 Materials Science and Engineering\n2.3 land project\n2.4 Structure Engineering\n2.5 seismic project\n2.6 Water Conservancy Engineering\n2.7 Environmental Engineering\n2.8 Transportation Engineering\n2.9 Others\n\n\n3 See\n4 reference\n\n\nHistory [edit]\nAncient [edit]\nIt is recommended to incorporate civil buildings into this entry or chapter. (discuss)\n Built in the ancient Roman Times Gard Bridge AD 1st Century\nThe historical span of ancient civil engineering can roughly divide from the old stone era to the middle of the 17th century. The civil engineering in this period is very primitive, the building materials mainly use natural materials such as stone, hubbed, and cranes. The construction tools are also very simple ax, hammer, knife, shovel, etc., the construction facilities mainly rely on experience, no system Theory. At that time, the representative of China was Dujiangyan, which was built by Dagu, Li Bing, and the Great Wall.\n\nModern [edit]\nThe historical span of modern civil engineering is generally considered to have a total of more than 300 years from the middle of the 17th century to the Second World War. During this period, civil engineering gradually became an independent discipline. 1638 Dali scholar Galileo issued the \"Dialogue on Two New Science\", first expressing the design theory of the beam with formulas. In 1687, Newton summed up three laws and the law, laying the basis of mechanical analysis for civil engineering. On the basis of material mechanics and elastic mechanics, France's Naweed has established the tolerance of structural design in civil engineering in 1825. Since then, the civil engineering has theoretical guidance.\nIn terms of materials, the invention of Portland cement and 1867 reinforced concrete began application is a historical event in the history of civil engineering. Due to large-scale production of concrete and steel, civil engineers can use these materials to build giant and complex engineering facilities.\n\nModern [edit]\nThe rapid development of science and technology after the Second World War, making the civil engineering can rely on further development with modern science and technology. The most important civil material and building materials: concrete and steel have a large development, improvement, reliability, durability, etc. have also improved significantly.\nThe constant development of synthetic materials broaden the types of materials that can be used in construction, and more excellent in performance than past conventional materials, the application of light and high-strength new materials makes many structures that are difficult to achieve in the past can be realized.\nThe numerical analysis of the computer enables the calculation of the calculation of the past due to manual difficulty calculation and being transformed into a more accurate calculation and analysis. For example, by means of a finite element method, the software can easily solve the internal force and displacement calculation of the complicated super-static structure that is difficult to complete in the previous manure. The continuous development of structural mechanics and limited element law makes it easy and accurate to make the calculation of structural and deformation, so that the design work is greatly simplified. Computer Aided Design (CAD) applications, designers are liberated from heavy manual design. More construction machinery use, the degree of construction automation is greatly improved.\n\nBranch [edit]\nEngineering measurement [edit]\nMain entry: engineering measurement\nEngineering measurement is an application measurement principle, in various projects, such as roads, tunnels, bridges and residential, mainly to discharge the design map of the project to the scene, and the engineers are based on the position Made.\nThe structure on the design graph on the engineering drawing is very important. If the error may result in a significant loss of engineering, the cost of engineering measurement is very small, but the importance is very large.\n\nMaterials Science and Engineering [edit]\nMain entry: Materials Science\n \nThe construction process of civil engineering must use a variety of metal materials or non-metallic materials, thus closely related to material science and material engineering. Materials science itself is a cross-section discipline, involving material properties and its application in the fields of various sciences and engineering. It studies the preparation of materials or processing technology, the microstructure of the material and the mutual relationship between the material macroscopic performance. The theory involved includes application physics, solid physics and chemistry, etc .; different applications such as wood materials, structural materials, building materials, mechanical materials, refractories are derived from the combination of civil engineering.\nAs the media in recent years, the media will focus a lot of attention in Nam Science and NiM technology, the materials science have been pushed to the forefront in many universities. It is also an important part of engineering appraisal and destruction analysis.\n\nEarth Engineering [edit]\nMain entry: Earth Project\nEarth project is also known as soil engineering, geotechnical engineering, geotechnical technology, mainly studying the engineering characteristics of soil constituent substances. The Earth Engineer will study data from the mud samples and rock samples from the site, and then calculate the structure required by the construction site. Foundation, geotechnical, soil, dam, tunnel, etc. are construction projects that require earth engineers to provide soil comments.\nThe earth project can be subdivided into soil mechanics, basic engineering, engineering geology, rock mechanics and other disciplines.\n\nStructure engineering [edit]\nMain entry: structural engineering\nStructure engineering is an engineering subject of building structures under the role of analysis and design. Structural engineering is usually classified as a branch of civil engineering, but it can also be studied as an independent discipline. [1]\nStructural engineers typically participate in housing buildings and other large structures, [2], but also participate in the fields such as mechanical, medical equipment, vehicles, etc., which can affect the use and safety. Structural engineers must be designed in accordance with national or industry norms to ensure safety (such as: structures that cannot be damaged without signs), maintainability and availability (such as: housing can't have too much deformed, avoiding user discomfort ). The design of the building must be able to withstand huge loads, as well as climate change and natural disasters.\nThe structural engineering theory is based on physical law and engineering experience in structures and structures in different situations and materials. Structural design generally uses a few simple structural components to form a complex structural system. [2]\n\nSeismic Engineering [edit]\n Test earthquake impact on general buildings and basic isolation buildings [3]\nMain entry: seismic project\nThe earthquake project is also known as the earthquake engineering, which is the study of its structural behavior when the building is affected by the earthquake. It is used to reduce the damage of the building, which is a part of structure design and civil engineering. Vibration control technology and basic isolation are the strongest and most economical tools in seismic engineering.\n\nWater conservancy project [edit]\nMain entry: water conservancy project\nThe water conservancy project is to control, the general name of various project construction built and protecting the surface and the underground water resources and the environment. Natural exercise and artificial delivery and utilization of civil engineering in civil engineering. The engineering field and bridge, dam, river, canal, and flood control have closely related to the design and construction of water flow, Jiangchuan and Bahai Causeway projects, and also involve public health and environmental engineering related environmental ecology and Water category.\nThe main work of water conservancy projects is a variety of hydraulic structures, including dams and river sea embankments, water supply pipe networks and water distribution pipe networks, ecological sustainable, flood management, sediment migration, and other Soil and Water Conservation Engineering and Earth Project. Transaction.\n\nEnvironmental Engineering [edit]\n Sewage sewer\nMain entry: Environmental Engineering\nEnvironmental Engineering is a way to apply science and engineering to improve the environment (including air, water, land resources), which in turn provides human living and other organisms to provide healthy water, air, and soil, including pollution site. . We can reduce and control the negative impact on the environment via educational public, protect the environment, the establishment of good projects.\n\nTraffic engineering [edit]\nMain entry: Traffic Engineering\nTransportation is a branch in civil engineering, including road traffic, railway transportation, aviation traffic, navigation traffic, and pipeline traffic. Road traffic engineering only studies traffic on the road, specifically, it is to unify people, cars, roads, and environments in a transportation system, explore their respective and intermienal regularities and their best cooperation The road traffic is smooth, high in traffic, less traffic accidents, high transportation efficiency, low degree of public injury, saving fuel and transportation costs and environmental coordination, comfortable.\n\nOther [edit]\nMarine Engineering\nBuild project\nLands and urban plans\nSoil and water conservation project\nSee [edit]\nWork management\nReference [edit]\n\n\n^ History of Structural Engineering.

& Oldid = 65144342\" The field covered by motor engineers includes complex power systems\n A design advanced integrated circuit.\nElectrical engineering is based on physics branches such as electronics, electromagnets, covering an engineering in the field of electronic, electronic computer, power engineering, telecommunications, control engineering, signal processing, mechanical electronics. Since the second half of the 19th century, with the commercialization of telegraph, telephone, electricity in supply and use, the discipline has gradually developed into a relatively independent professional field.\nThe motor engineering covers branches in this field, but in some places, the meaning of \"Electrical Engineering\" (English: Electrical Engineering) sometimes does not include \"Electronic Engineering\" (English: Electronic Engineering). In this case, \"Electric Engineering\" refers to a power system involving a large energy (such as electricity transmission, heavy motor machinery and electric motors), and \"electronic engineering\" refers to the electronic system that handles small signals (such as computer and physical circuitry). ). [1]\nAnother difference is that the power engineer focuses on the transmission of electrical energy, and electronic engineers focus on the use of electronic signals. The range of these subsequators will sometimes overlap: For example, power electronics use power electronic components to convert and control electrical energy; another, such as smart grid detecting electrical energy suppliers and general homes' electrical use And according to it, the power consumption of the home appliance is adjusted to achieve energy, reducing loss, and enhance the reliability of transmission network. Therefore, the motor engineering also corresponds to the expertise in the field of electronics engineering.\n\ntable of Contents\n\n1 history\n\n1.1 19th century\n1.2 Modern Development\n1.3 Breakthrough - Solid State Devices and Integrated Circuits\n\n\n2 subject education\n3 employees\n4 focus on attention\n5 branch\n\n5.1 Power Electronics\n5.2 Control Engineering\n5.3 Electronic Engineering\n5.4 microelectronics\n5.5 signal processing\n5.6 Communication Engineering\n5.7 measurement\n5.8 Computer Engineering\n\n\n6 related disciplines\n7 References\n\n\nHistory [edit]\nSince the beginning of the seventeenth century, the phenomenon of electricity has become a scientific exploration topic. William Gilbert is probably one of the earliest motor engineers. He first designed an electrostatic electrostatic electrostatic electrostatic electrostatically existing in electrostatic charge, and the first clearly distinguish between magnetic and electricity, and the term \"electricity\" Name [2]. In 1775, Alexandrovolites Make a scientific experimental improvement improvement of the electricity (Electrophorus) that can be used to make static charges. In 1800, he succeeded in developing a volt pile capable of continuously generating a relatively stable current, and is the earliest chemical battery. [3] However, related studies have been officially launched until the 19th century.\n\n\n19th century [edit]\n Maiki Faracea discovered electromagnetic induction, thereby laid the foundation of electric technology.\nIn 1827, the Ohge's law proposed by Glorue Oim indicates the quantitative relationship between the current, voltage and resistance in the circuit. In 1831, Maiki Farah found electromagnetic induction. In 1873, James Maxwell integrates the previous people in the book \"Electromagnetic Unit\", and proposes the Maxwell Equation Group to open the classical electric mechanics [4].\nSince the 1830s, all kinds of efforts made to electromagnetic knowledge are finally achieved, that is, telegraph technology. In the 19th century, due to the emergence of land-line, the seabed cable and the 1390 wireless newspaper (Wireless Telegraphy), fast communication finally achieved, and the whole world's communication construction is also changed.\nIn order to ensure that it does not encounter difficulties and misunderstandings in terms of application of electromagnetic theory, it is especially necessary to develop a simple and convenient scale standard unit. Research on this area has prompted the setting and adoption of international standard units, such as volts, ampere, Coulomb, Farah and Henry. This international standard system reached a consensus in Chicago in 1893, [5] thus laid the foundation of various industries for the future progress of the standard unit system. Many countries immediately legislate to recognize that these international standards are valid. [6]\nIn these decades, motor engineering catenarily was classified as a branch field of physics. In 1882, the University of Damsta Agent University in Germany set off the world's first motor engineering professor seat. In the same year, the Physics Department of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology began to launch a bachelor's degree program in the direction of motor engineering. [7] [8] In 1883, the University of Damsta Technology established a motor system to create a university in the world. [9] In 1885, Cornell University became a university in the United States. [10] In 1885, the University of London founded the first \"motor technology department\" in the UK. The first director is John Fleming, and has changed to the motor engineering department in several years. [11] In 1886, Missouri University has also established a system of motor engineering. According to some literature, Missouri is the first American university [12] very quickly, including the University of Georgia Institute of Technology. Establishing a motor engineering system.\n\n Toma Edison built the world's first large power network\nAfter decades of development, the application field of motor engineering is sharply expanded. In 1882, Tom Mas Edison built the world's first large power network to provide a DC electricity of 110 volts to 59 people in New York Manhattan. In 1884, the Sir Charles Parsons invented the steam turbine engine. Now, the use of turbine engines conversion from a wide variety of thermal energy, with a total of 80% of the world's energy usage.\n\n\n Nikola Tesla has a transformer and induction motor that is an important device for an AC system.\nIn the late 1880, two civilized confrontations of different power transmission methods were witnessed. Original DC-current mode uses direct current to transmit electrical energy, newly occurring AC-like communication uses AC power to transmit electrical energy, this triggered a so-called \"current war\". [13] AC power generation technology is excellent in power transmission technology, especially the AC allows the use of transformers to increase or decrease (this is a large lack of direct current). In addition, the use of high voltage alternating current is greatly extended, and the transmission of electrical energy transmission is greatly expanded, and the safety and efficiency of power transmission is boosted using transformers. Due to the above advantages, the AC power supply is gradually replaced by DC power supply.\n\nModern development [edit]\nDuring the development of radio technology, many scientists and inventors have contributed to radio and electronics, respectively. In the classic experiments made in 1888, Heinrich Hertz transmits and receives radio waves of the wireless wave band using motor equipment to confirm radio waves. In 1895, Nikola Tesla was launched from the New York West Point from the New York West Point from the New York Laboratory. [14].\nAt 1897, Carl Braun began to assemble the cathode ray tube in the oscilloscope, and the cathode ray tube also became the key zero component of the television [15]. In 1904, John Fleming first invented the diode. Two years later, Robert Von Lieben and Li Decrest independently invented a vacuum tube capable of magnifying current Body (also known as \"Pragmators\") [16].\nIn 1895, Goleier Maribi further improved Hz's radio transfer method, extending the transfer distance of the wireless telecommunications number to 1.5 miles (2.4 km). In December 1901, in order to confirm that he has mastered the technology of more advanced transmission radio waves, he can not be affected by the Earth's curvature. He launched the wireless telecommunication number from the UK Cornwall launching station, crossing the Atlantic Ocean. On the other side, Canada Newfoundland St. Johns, actually received the signal, between 2,100 miles (3,400 km) between two places! [17] In 1920, Albert HULL invented a vacuum tube-magnetron that generated microwaves (Magnetron). In 1945, the PERCY SPENCER has successfully developed a microwave oven [18] [19]. In 1934, under the guidance of Harry Wimperis, the British Army began using microwave technology to develop radar in Bowdsey, and started to operate in August 1936 [20] .\nIn 1941, German scientist Kangrad Chuze showed the world's first full-featured programmatic computer, ie Z3 system. In 1943, Tommy Flowers designed and made a dummy computer, which is an unprecedented, fully utilized fixed procedures made of electronic components, can be used digital computers. [21] [22] On February 15, 1946, the US Army was developed by US Army Investment in the Second World War, in the Pioneer John Mauchly, John Iraq Under the supervision of John Eckert, it was born in Pennsylvania University. ENIAC is generally considered to be the first \"general use\" electronic computer in the world, and its invention is an important milestone in the history of modern computer development [23].\n\nExtra great breakthrough - solid-state device and integrated circuit [edit]\nIn 1947, William Xiaochli, John Pudding and Walter Bourdon, working in Bell Laboratory, invented solid state crystals. This is one of the most important inventions in the twentieth century. The electrosphate has the advantages of volume production, miniaturization, low cost, and the like, and almost all modern electronic products require electrical crystals. Because \"research and discovery of the semiconductor\", Xiaokeley, Patin and Bamon won the 1956 Nobel Physics Award.\nIn 1958, Jack Kilbe and 1959 Robert Nuis independently invented the actual circuit [24]. Applying a physical circuit technology, a large number of microelectric crystals can be integrated into a small wafer, providing a possibility for the occurrence of microprocessors. Intel Corporates Intel 4004 microprocessor in 1971 is the world's first microprocessor, which is designed with his team with his team with his team. It can perform 4-bit operations in the United States Hoff. In 1973, Intel was also designed to successfully eight-bit microprocessor Intel 8080, and an Intel 8080 was configured inside the first personal computer Altair 8800. [25] The current single large-scale integrated circuit chip can integrate more than 1,000,000 transistors. [26]\n\nSubject education [edit]\nMotor engineers usually pass through \"motor engineering\", \"electronic engineering\" or \"power electronics\" famous education. Although the focus of various degrees is different, they are mostly required to learn a series of common basic courses. Completion of schools generally take four or five years. Since the nature of the school is different, students may be granted by bachelor, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Technology (Bachelor of Applied Science) after completing the school. Journal of Bachelor Of Technology Science. Master's bachelor's degree in motor engineering requires students to learn physics, mathematics, computer science, etc., complete one or more project designs related to professional knowledge applications, and elect other courses related to motor engineering. These preparation courses will allow students to learn the basic principles and basic practical skills of motor engineering. Subsequently, students can choose one or more sub-disciplines according to their own focus and interest until graduation. In many schools, electronics engineering is included in motor engineering, others believe that the academic knowledge of the two governments is wide enough and can be developed. [27]\nSome motor engineers choose to continue the graduate phase after graduation, strive to obtain graduate degrees, such as Master of Engineering, master's degree, or specialist in Ph.D. Engineering Doctorate degree. Master of Motor Engineering consists of course operations, studying both or one of them. The doctoral course is more focused on topic, often is considered to be the starting point of the academic career of motor engineers. In the UK and some European countries, engineering master's degree is often considered to be a smaller extension of undergraduate degrees, rather than graduate students in strict sense. [28] [29]\n\nPersonnel [edit]\nIn many countries, the bachelor's degree from the engineering discipline represents the first step in professional certification, and the bachelor's curriculum itself needs to be certified by a professional institution. After completing the certification course, engineers must meet a series of requirements (including the requirements of work experience) to eventually obtain the corresponding professional certification. Engineers can get registered engineers or other similar certificates (licenses). For example, in the United States, Canada, South Africa, these engineers can officially become the \"Professional Engineer\", which is called \"European Engineer\" in the European Union.\nIn different regions, professional certification will bring different degrees of benefits to engineers. For example, in the US and Canada, only certified engineers can issue public or private projects. [30] In many countries, government agencies have made this provision in the laws of state and provincial, such as Quebec's Engineers ACT. [31] In other countries, there may be no such mandatory regulations. However, most professional certification agencies have set a series of rules and regulations to constrain engineers, and they are likely to be removed if they violate them. [32] In this way, the industry organization plays an important role in the standardization and standardization of engineering professional fields. However, even in the professional certification jurisdiction, engineers must still abide by the contract. In some cases, engineers' work failure may be considered faulty and even play. They must also consider the influence of engineering in environmental protection during operation and follow existing laws and regulations.\nThe electronics engineer learns is one of the most authoritative professional institutions in the field of motor engineering. The association claims that academic literature related to motor engineering is from its members. It has 430000 members worldwide, holds more than 300 academic seminars per year. [33] [34] Another famous organization of the British Engineering and Technology Association (IET) published 21 academic journals in all The ball has more than 150,000 members, claiming to be Europe's largest professional engineering organization. [35] [36] In the field of motor engineering, professional knowledge update is very frequent. In order to maintain work efficiency, engineers usually choose to participate in various professional organizations, regularly pay attention to new trends in the industry, and participate in continuing education - this is quite necessary in the industry.\nIn Australia and the United States, motor engineers account for approximately 0.25% of total labor force. As of 2006, 300,000 employees in the American motor engineering related fields, this number is 17,000 in Australia (2008), which accounts for about 0.2% of the labor force. Australia reported 96% of its domestic male motor engineers. [37] [38]\n\nFocus on the focus [edit]\nMotor engineers have made important contributions to many modern science and technology products, and the crystallization of motor engineering can be seen everywhere in modern technology products such as global positioning systems to power generation systems. Engineer design, development, testing and monitoring motor systems, installation and deployment of electronic equipment. For example, they participate in the design of the telecommunications system, the operation and maintenance, building lighting and power supply system of the power plant, the power control of household appliances and industrial machines. [39]\n\n The operating range of the motor engineer includes the design of the communication satellite shown in the figure.\nThe basis of motor engineering is physics and mathematics, and these two basic discipline help engineers obtain quantitative and qualitative descriptions of electrical system work. Today, most engineering disciplines involve the use of computers, computer-aided design is also very common in design and testing of electrical systems. Despite this, for engineers, the initial idea is still crucial.\nAlthough most motor engineers can understand the most basic circuit analysis knowledge (such as related resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, and inductive components), the theory of applications is still different. For example, quantum mechanics and solid physics are more important for engineers engaged in large-scale integrated circuit design, and more focused on signal processing and related mathematical knowledge (such as discrete Fu Li). Leave transform) and relatively basic circuit analysis knowledge. The expertise of different branch disciplines is distinguished, but in general, mathematical computing power, basic computer technology, and understanding of industry terms are also valued by each branch discipline.\nFor many motor engineers, technology is just part of their daily work, they often discuss, plan project budgets and project progress with customers. [39] Many senior engineers will manage a technical team. For them, project management capabilities are quite important. Many factory technical projects involve a record and writing of a variety of documents, so good writing, communication skills are also not ignored. The working environment of the motor engineer is distinguished according to their professional focus.\n\nBranch [edit]\nMotor Engineering has many branch disciplines, which are listed below. Several most widely known disciplines. Many motor engineers work only focus on one of the branches, and some will involve overlap of multiple branch disciplines. Some areas, such as electronics engineering and computer projects, are considered relatively independent disciplines.\n\nPower electronics [edit]\nMain entry: Power Electronics\n The ground power supply network uses the electric pole.\nPower electronics mainly involves several steps of energy generation, delivery, distribution, and some related equipment design. These devices include AC-DC converters (rectifiers, choppers, inverters and inverters), transformers, generators, relays, special high-voltage applications and other power electronics devices. Most government will invest and maintain the power transmission network system to connect each large generator and power users. By connecting the electrical appliance to the grid, the user can obtain electrical energy in the form of a commodity without the need to purchase generator power generation. The work of power electronics engineers is mainly designed and maintained for power grids and connected power systems. This \"Internet\" facility gives additional electrical energy of the grid, or will consume electrical energy, or combine these two operational capabilities. Another type of power system known as \"down network\" is superior to the \"Internet\" system in some cases, for example, on a travel vehicle that cannot be connected to the grid. Using satellite control power systems is one of the directions of power electronics research, with a real-time feedback system, it can avoid power fluctuations and reduce the probability of power outage. For example, China's Beidou Satellite Navigation System provides a unified timing system for automation scheduling, fault accelerry, relay protection, monitoring system, and power plant unit automation, so that each subsystem can be accurate and unified. Standard stability work. [40] [41]\n\nControl engineering [edit]\nMain entry: Control Engineering\n The control system plays a key role when flight flight.\nControl engineering is mainly focused on modeling of complex dynamic systems and design controllers to promote dynamic systems to evolve according to ideal. The control engineering is widely used, such as the flight system of civil aviation aircraft and promotion system, car cruise settlement system, etc. Developing excellent control theory is one of the premise of improving industrial automation. Engineers will use electronic circuits, digital signal processors, microcontrollers, and programmable logic controllers to implement embedded systems. With the development of technology, the control system itself is getting smaller and smaller, and the power loss is getting lower and lower, but the function is constantly improving. [42]\nControl Engineers will often use feedback on this concept when designing control systems (Control System). For example, a car with cruise speed function continuously monitors the speed of the car, and reports to the control system, then control the system to adjust the output power of the internal combustion engine according to the current vehicle. If the control system can get feedback regularly, the appropriate response can be made in accordance with the control theory.\n\nElectronic engineering [edit]\nMain entry: Electronic Engineering\n Various different electronic components\nThe scope of electronics engineering covers the design and testing of electronic circuits composed of electronic components such as resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, electrostatics. Basic analog circuits, digital circuits are basic elements that form any modern electronic information system. [43]\nBefore the Second World War, the research scope of electronics engineering is only limited to various communication technologies, radars, commercial radios, and early TV technology. After the war, as consumer electronics began to be developed, this area quickly expanded to modern TV, radio system, computer and microprocessor. In the second half of the 1950s, the term \"electronic engineering\" has gradually replaced \"radio project\".\nBefore the integrated circuit was invented in 1959, the electronic circuit was also manually mounted by the discrete electronic component. The disadvantage of these discrete electronic circuits is that the occupied space is large, low electrical energy efficiency, limited speed, but still usage in some special application areas. The integrated circuit can integrate a large number of microelectronic components (mainly microelectric crystals) to a small wafer of approximately coin sizes. This also provides possibilities for manufacturing high-function computers and other electronic devices that are visible everywhere today.\n\nMicroelectronics [edit]\nMain entry: microelectronics\n A INTEL 80486DX2 microprocessor\nMicroelectronics mainly study the design and microfabringation of extremely small size circuits in the integrated circuit. This minimal size circuit can also be individually used as a general electronic device. The most common microelectric devices include semiconductor transistors, resistors, capacitors, and inductors, which can be processed to microscopic sizes. NACT is more advanced, and the research range also turns to the feature size to reach the nanometer-level device. Modern electronic devices have reachedana-level, 100 nano-process technology has also become industry standards in 2002.\nThe manufacturing process of the microelectronic device requires physical and chemical processing of silicon (in high frequency occasions) wafer for physical and chemical processing of compound semiconductor such as arsenide, indium phosphide, and other compound semiconductor) wafers. Transmission and current control (in the microelectronics, the higher the higher). When studying these manufacturing processes, many chemical, material science knowledge is required, and the quantum mechanical effects of electrons must be considered under low feature sizes. The base semiconductor device includes a diode, a bipolar transistor, a metal oxide semiconductor field effect electric crystal, and a metal semiconductor field effect tube. [44]\n\nSignal processing [edit]\nMain entry: signal processing\n Bayer Filter on the photosensitive coupling element provides red, green, blue color value on each pixel.\nSignal processing refers to the analysis and control of signals. The signal can be divided into an analog signal and a digital signal, where the former is continuously changed with the real information, and the latter changes based on a series of discrete quantities representing real information. Analog signal processing generally involves an audio device amplifying or filtering audio signals, telecommunications devices modulation, and demodulation telecommunications signals. The analog signals and digital signals can transform each other by analog digital converters. As the foundation of modern multimedia technology, digital signal processing often involves data compression, error correction, error correction, especially linear, unchanged system theory, Fourier transform, and other basic theories. [45] [46]\nSignal processing involves many mathematical theories and a large number of mathematical operations. With the development of communication, control, radio and television, power electronics, biomedical engineering, etc., the application range of signal processing is continuously expanded. Although many simulation systems have been replaced by digital systems with digital system, the analog signal processing is still an indispensable part of many control systems.\nDigital signal processing can be achieved on site-programmable logic gate arrays, special application primary circuits, microprocessors. Integrated circuits with digital signal processor functions in many modern electronic systems and electronic products, such as standard definition television, high-definition television, radio and action communication devices, high-fidelity audio equipment, Dolby sound Running algorithm, global mobile communication system mobile phone, digital audio player, camera, digital camera, car control system, silent headset, digital spectrum analyzer, smart rocket navigation, radar, a variety of image processing, Video Processing, voice processing, etc. [47]\n\nCommunication engineering [edit]\nMain entry: Communication Engineering\n The disk-type receiving antenna on the ground is an important equipment for the satellite communication system.\nRemote communication mainly pays attention to the transfer of the channels of coaxial cables, optical fibers, free space, and the like. In order to realize the transmission of information in the free space, the information encoded injection frequency is required to be used in the carrier of the transfer, which is called a change. Commonly used simulation modulation techniques include amplitude modulation and frequency modulation. The choice of modulation technology affects the cost and performance of the system, and usually engineers need to measure the pros and cons of these two factors from many ways to achieve the best results.\nOnce the information propagation characteristics of the communication system are determined, the communication engineer can start designing a transmitter (Transmitter) and the receiver. Sometimes, these two devices can form a two-way communication system, while implementing the functions transmitted and received, this system is called transceiver. When designing a sender, you need to focus on power loss, and this parameter is closely related to its signal strength. If the intensity of the transmission signal is not high, the signal is likely to be interfered with the interference, and the required information cannot be reached correctly.\nAs mobile phones become a common portable equipment in people's daily lives, technicians have added additional functions other than speech calls, such as SMS, Wi-Fi, making the phone a mobile Internet device. These convenient and fast services are based on the general packet wireless service, EV-DO or 3G such infrastructure technology. [48] \u200b\u200bCurrently, 4G is already in research and testing phases. [49]\n\nMeasurement [edit]\n Radar speed\nInstruments, sensors use objects to measure physical quantity, such as pressure, temperature, and so on using an object to exhibit different conditions under different conditions. Since the electrical signal can be easily handled (analog signal processing, digital signal processing), many modern instruments operate in the principle of electrical sensing. In order to manufacture these instrumentation devices, designers need to have good physical basis knowledge, especially for electromagnetic, material science, semiconductor physics. For example, the radar speedometer utilizes the observer that the frequency of the foreign object is different from the difference (Doppler effect) of its own frequency of its wave (Doppler effect); the thermocouple is measured by temperature difference.\nThe control system typically requires information from the outside and gives an external control signal. Taking the car as an example, the cruise settlement system needs to use the speed sensor or speed meter to monitor the motion state of the car, then pass this information to the central processor, the central processor is based on the driver's pre-set target speed and current speed. Differences to determine the state of the engine. Therefore, the measurement technology is an important part of the control engineering, but it is more concerned about the extraction of the physical quantity. At present, the measurement technology is positive to miniaturize, rapid development, and its accuracy is also increasing. [50]\n\nComputer engineering [edit]\nMain entry: computer engineering\n Supercomples play an important role in calculating biological and geographic information systems.\nComputer engineering mainly refers to the design of computer and computer systems. It includes a design of computer hardware, portable electronic products, supercomputers, etc. Computer project also involves software software for hardware systems. However, computer engineering usually does not involve application software designs associated with hardware, and those parts are often considered a category of software engineering. With the development of computer engineering, integration of integrated circuits such as special application of active circuits and system chips is constantly increasing, and functions are constantly enhanced.\nThe scale of the integrated circuit begins, it is increasing. At present, the design, simulation, and verification of large scale integrated circuits have gradually supported support for electronic design automation tools. The designer can now focus on building a logical function of the circuit system, and completing the cumbersome tasks in the wiring, layout, and layout with computer assistance. [51] The mainstream hardware description language (such as Verilog and VHDL) enables designers to complete complex hardware circuitry in a similar computer programming. [52] Computer engineering professionals need to have a good electronics foundation and should also have certain computer operations and programming capabilities.\n\nRelated Discipline [edit]\nMechanical Electronics is in the intersection of motor systems and mechanical systems. This combined system is called Electromechanical System, widespread applications in workers, merchants, defense, and academic fields, such as automation manufacturing systems, HVAC, aircraft, and various branch systems for vehicles.\nThe term \"mechanical electronics\" often refers to a macro system. However, future learning experts predict that in the near future, the micro-electromechanical appliance will emerge as the spring bamboo shoots after the rain. In some extent, this prophecy It has already begun. The high-function microelectromechanical system has been assembled in the car. It can sense impact, decide from the data read, tell the airbag to begin expanding. The inkjet printing machine reaches the microelectromechanical system to achieve high resolution printing tasks. Engineers hoped to study more advanced microelectronics technology to make minimal implantable medical equipment, or modified optical switch technology. [53]\nThe Engineering Science Department is a department that is an integrated motor engineering, information engineering, mechanical engineering, and is commonly known as the \"Engineering Department\".\nAnother related discipline is a biomedical engineering, which involves the design of medical equipment. This is roughly divided into two types of fixative equipment and operational equipment. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, ECG instruments, etc. are all fixed equipment, while artificial cochlear, rhythm regulators, artificial hearts, etc. are acting equipment.\n\nReference [edit]\n\n\n^ What is The Difference Between Electrical and Electronic Engineering ?.

[7] [8] It is often described as a systematic study on the algorithm processing of creation, description, and conversion information. Computer science includes a lot of branches; some emphasizing calculations for specific results, such as computer graphics; and some are to explore the nature of computational problems, such as calculating complexity theory; there are also some fields to implement how to implement calculations, such as program language theory is research Description of the calculated method, the program design is to apply a specific program language to solve specific calculation problems. Human-machine interactions are focused on how to make computer and calculations become useful, easy to use, and anytime, anywhere.\nSometimes the public will mistake computer science is a business that solves computer problems (such as information technology), or is just related to experience using the computer, such as playing games, internet or text processing. In fact, computer science is concerned, not only to understand the nature of similar games, browser, but also create new programs or improve existing procedures through existing knowledge. [9]\nAlthough the name of Computer Science contains computers, the number of computers is actually involved in computer itself. Therefore, some new names are proposed. Certain key colleges are tended to calculate science in terms, with accurate emphasis between the two. Danish scientist Peter Naur recommends using the term \"Datalog\" to reflect this fact that science disciplines are processed around data and data, and do not have to involve computers. The first scientific institution using this term is the Datalog College, the University of Copenhagen, and the college was established in 1969, and Peter Naur is the first professor. This term is mainly used in Nordic countries. At the same time, in the early stages of computing technology development, \"ACM Communications\" suggested terms for the terminology of calculation field: Turingineer, Turologist, Flow-Charts-Man, Applied Mathematician and Applied Epistemologist. [10] After three months, Comptologist was proposed, and the second year became Hypologist. [11] The term Computics has also been proposed. In Europe, the name originating from information (Information) and math or Automatic is more common than the origin of computer or computation, such as Informatique, Informatik (German), Informatika (Slavic).\nThe famous computer scientist Azhel Daxterra has pointed out: \"Computer science is not just about computer, just like astronomy is not just about telescope.\" (\"Computer Science is no more about computers Than Astronomy Is About Telescopes \") Design, deploy computer and computer systems are often considered to be a non-computer science discipline. For example, studying computer hardware is considered as part of a computer engineering, and for commercial computer systems Research and deployment are called information technology or information systems. However, it is now increasingly increasing the ideas of various types of computer related disciplines. Computer science research is often cross-compared with other disciplines, such as mathematics, engineering, cognitive science and economics.\nComputer science is considered to be more close than other science disciplines and mathematics. Some observers say calculations are a mathematical science. [12] Early computer science is affected by mathematics research results, such as Kurt Gothe, Allen Tuling, Lusha Peter (English: r\u00f3zsa p\u00e9ter), Alu Zuqi, etc. Research, these two areas are in some disciplines, such as the logic, category theory, domain theory and algebies, and constantly have beneficial ideological exchanges.\n\ntable of Contents\n\n1 history\n\n1.1 main achievement\n\n\n2 philosophy\n3 Field of computer science\n\n3.1 Theoretical Computer Science\n\n3.1.1 Data Structure and Algorithm\n3.1.2 Calculation Theory\n3.1.3 Information Theory and Coding Theory\n3.1.4 Programming Language and Compiler\n3.1.5 Formal method\n\n\n3.2 Computer System\n\n3.2.1 Computer Architecture and Computer Engineering\n3.2.2 Operating System\n3.2.3 Concurrent, parallel and distributed systems\n3.2.4 Computer Network\n3.2.5 Computer Security and Cryptography\n3.2.6 Database\n\n\n3.3 Computer Application Technology\n\n3.3.1 Computer Graphics\n3.3.2 Scientific calculation\n3.3.3 Multimedia Technology\n3.3.4 Artificial Intelligence\n\n\n3.4 Software Engineering\n\n\n4 academic circles\n\n4.1 meeting\n4.2 Journal\n\n\n5 as a secondary professional for higher education\n6 industry\n7 References\nExtension reading\n9 external link\n10 See\n\n\nHistory [edit]\nMain entry: History of computer science\nEarly computer scientific foundation is dating back to the invention of recent electronic computers. Those machines that calculate fixed numerical tasks, such as abacus, have existed since an ancient Greek period, and algorithms for speeding up calculations are extensive before the abacus is invented by ancient computing instruments such as abacus.\nWilhelm Schickard designed the world's first mechanical calculator in 1623, but did not complete its construction. [13] Blazuse Pasca is designed in 1642 and built a mechanical calculator in the world. Pascaline. In 1673, Leibniz began the construction of stepper calculator (English: Stepped Reckoner) and was completed in 1694, and he was also considered to be the first computer scientist and information theoretist because of recorded a binary system. Edda Lovles assists Charles Babacc to design differential machines in Victoria [14] [15]. Around 1900, the punch came [16]. However, these machines are limited to only a single task can only be completed, or at the same time is a subset of all possible tasks.\nIn the 1940s, with the update more powerful computing machine (such as ABC computer, electronic numerical integral computer) was invented, the term \"computer\" started to refer to those machines instead of their ancestors. [17] The concept of computer has become more clear, but it is not only used for mathematical operations, in general, the field of computer science has also expanded to the calculation. From the early 1950s to the early 1960s, computer science began to be established as different types of academic disciplines. [18] The world's first computer science site was established in 1962 in 1962. [19] With the emergence of practical computers, many computing applications have gradually changed into different fields of research in their own way.\nAlthough many people don't believe that the computer may become a scientific research, it has gradually been recognized by the academic in 50 years. [20] IBM is one of the participants in the computer scientific revolution in that period. In that stage of exploration, IBM 704 published by IBM (interNational Business Machines) and the IBM 709 computers were widely used. \"However, it is still a very frustrated thing to use IBM computer. If you make a mistake in a command, the program will crash, and you have to come back from the beginning.\" [20] In the late 1950s, Computer Science disciplines are still in the development stage, this problem is a very common thing at the time.\nOver time, computer science technology has significantly improved in availability and effectiveness. Modern society has witnessed the computer from the major transformation accepted by the majority of users. Initially, the computer is very expensive, to effectively use them, and some extent must be completed by a professional computer operator. However, as the computer has become popular and inexpensive, it has almost no need to assist in the assistance, although at some time aid is still there.\n\nMain achievements [edit]\n The Germans used to encrypt communication in the World War II. Enny Gima Cascifier Information in Bracei is considered to be an important factor in helping the Allies win in World War I. [twenty one]\nAlthough computer science is considered to be a short history of a formal discipline, it has made many fundamental contributions to science and society. In fact, computer science is the same as the foundation of the information age, and the information revolution. The driving force is considered to be the third significant leap in the advancement of human technology after the industrial revolution (AD 1750-1850) and Neolithic Revolution (8000-5000 BC).\nThese contributions include:\n\nTurn on \"Digital Revolution\", including today's information age and the Internet. [twenty two]\nDefinitions of calculated and computational forms have proven that there is no unknown problem in which the presence is calculated. [twenty three]\nThe concept of programming language is proposed as a tool for accurately expressing a handler using different abstractions. [twenty four]\nIn the field of cryptography, the decipherment of the Ennygema tagging machine is considered an important factor in the victory in World War II. [twenty one]\nScientific calculations make it possible to analyze the actual and very complex processes and scenes, which can make some experiments through software. At the same time, the in-depth study of human thoughts has also been achieved, making human genoty planning human genes. [22] There is also a distributed computing project of protein folding Folding @ home.\nThe algorithm transaction improves the efficiency and circulation of financial markets by using artificial intelligence, machine learning and other large-scale statistics and numerical methods. [25] High frequency algorithm transactions will also increase volatility. [26]\nComputer graphics and computer imaging (CGI) are everywhere in modern entertainment, especially in television, movies, advertising, animations and video games. Even with a movie that is not used to CGI technology, it is usually taken with a digital camera, or using a digital video editor clip or later processed. [27] [28]\nSimulation of various processes, including computational fluid dynamics, physics, electrical and electronic systems and circuits, as well as social and social forms (especially war games, war games) that are associated with human residence (especially war games, WAR Games). Modern computers can optimize these designs, such as aircraft design. Especially in electrical and electronic circuit design, SPICE software has a great help for new physical implementation (or modifications). [29] It contains basic design software for integrated circuits. [Source Request]\nArtificial intelligence becomes more important because it becomes more efficient and complex. There are many artificial intelligence applications, some of which can be seen at home, such as robotic vacuum cleaners. It also appears in a video game and a drone, anti-missile system, and brigade support robot (English: Legged Squad Support System) on video games and modern battlefields. [30]\nHuman-machine interaction combines novel algorithms with design strategies to achieve rapid human performance, low error rate, easy to learn and high satisfaction. Researchers use human geographical observation and automation data collection to understand user needs, and then perform availability tests to improve design. Key innovations include direct manipulation (English: Direct Manipulation), optional web links, touch screen design, mobile applications, and virtual reality.\nPhilosophy [edit]\nMain entry: Philosophy of computer science\nPeter Wegner (English: Peter Wegner) proposes computer science into three areas: mathematics, engineering, science. Amnon H. Eden proposed three paradigms to various fields of computer science: [31]\n\n\"Rationalism paradigm\", regarding computer science as a branch of mathematics, is very popular in theory computer science, mainly using interpretation.\n\"Technical expert paradigm\", this type of paradigm has a significant engineering tendency, especially in software engineering.\n\"Science paradigm\", some branches of artificial intelligence can be used as representatives of such paradigms (for example, for artificial life).\nField of computer science [edit]\nAs a subject, computer science covers the limit of the theoretical research and calculation of algorithms to how to implement computing systems through hardware and software. [32] CSAB (previously called Computing Sciences Accreditation Board), representatives of Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and IEEE Computer Association (English: IEEE Computer Society) (IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY) (IEEE-CS) [34], established 4 major areas of computer science disciplines: calculation theory, algorithm and data structure, programming methods and programming languages, and computer composition and architecture. CSAB has established other important areas such as software engineering, artificial intelligence, computer network and communication, database systems, parallel computing, distributed computing, human-computer interaction, computer graphics, operating systems, and numerical and symbol calculations.\n\nTheoretical Computer Science [Edit]\nMain entry: Theoretical Computer Science\nGeneralized Theoretical Computer Science includes classic calculation theory and other focus on more abstract, logical and mathematical calculations.\n\nData structure and algorithm [edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO\n(\n\nn\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\ DisplayStyle O (n ^ {2})}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of Algorithms\n\nalgorithm\n\ndata structure\n\nCalculate geometry\n\nGraph Theory\n\nThe algorithm refers to a good calculation process, which takes one or a set of values \u200b\u200bas input, after a series of defined calculations, get one or set of outputs. [35] The algorithm is an important area of \u200b\u200bcomputer scientific research and is also the basis for many other computer science and technology. The algorithm mainly includes data structures, calculating geometries, charts, etc. In addition, the algorithm also includes many miscellaneous, such as mode matching, partial number theory.\n\nCalculation theory [edit]\nMain entry: calculation theory\nAccording to Peter J. Denning, the most fundamental problem of computer science is \"What can be effectively automated?\" [12] The research of calculation theory is to focus on answering this fundamental issue, and to be calculated, to implement these calculations How much resources need to be used. In order to try to answer the first question, the recipient test is solved in a variety of theoretical computational models.

Any modern industry and engineering areas need to be applied to machinery, such as agriculture, forestry, mining, etc. need agricultural machinery, forestry machinery, mining machinery; metallurgical engineering and chemical engineering require metallurgical machinery, chemical machinery; textile and food processing industries need textile machinery, Food processing machinery; water conservancy, civil buildings, roads and bridges require construction machinery; electric power projects need electric power machinery; transportation industry requires various vehicles, ships, aircraft, etc .; various commodities, packaging, storage, and unloading requires various corresponding Working machine.\nThe development of various engineering areas require the development of mechanical engineering to adapt to the mechanical engineering to provide mechanical engineering. Some mechanical invention and improvement lead to the emergence and development of new engineering techniques and new industries, such as the successful manufacture of large machinery, which has promoted the establishment of power systems; the invention has led to the rise of railway projects and railway undertakings Invention and progress of internal combustion engines, gas turbines, rocket engines, and ships, the development of ships, aircraft and aircraft leads to the rise of nautical engineering, navigation, aviation engineering and aviation cause; high voltage equipment (including compressors, reactors, sealing technologies, etc. The development has led to success of many new synthetic chemical engineering. The mechanical engineering is to achieve development momentum under the pressure of continuously improved demand, while also improving and innovating from various disciplines and technologies.\n\ntable of Contents\n\n1 Development Evolution History [Source Request]\n\nAncient\n1.2 modern\n\n1.2.1 Development of Power Machinery\n1.2.2 Development of machining technology\n\n\n1.3 modern\n\n1.3.1 Mechanical Engineer Society\n\n\n\n\n2 Mechanical Engineering Education\n\n2.1 Specialization and integration of mechanical department\n\n\n3 basic discipline\n4 Services of mechanical engineering and work content [Source Request]\n\n4.1 Service area\n4.2 Work content\n4.3 Mechanical Engineering Talents\n\n4.3.1 Scientists and scholars\n4.3.2 Engineer\n4.3.3 Technician\n4.3.4 mechanics\n\n\n4.4 Salary and job prospects\n\n\n5 branch discipline\n\n5.1 Solid Mechanics\n5.2 Fluid Mechanics\n\n5.2.1 Application\n\n\n5.3 Mechanical Design\n5.4 Mechanical Manufacturing\n5.5 thermodynamics and thermal science\n5.6 Motor Electronics and Control\n\n5.6.1 Application\n\n\n\n\n6 prospective research field [source request]\n\n6.1 microcomputer system\n6.2 NiM Technology\n\n\n7 Future Outlook [Source Request]\n\n7.1 Mechanical Engineering and Artificial Intelligence\n\n\n8 See\n9 reference\n\n9.1 WikiBooks\n9.2 Related Journals\n9.3 Professional Group\n9.4 Extended reading\n\n\n10 external connection\n\n\nDevelopment Evolution History [Source Request] [Edit]\nAncient [edit]\nHuman beings become a \"modern person\" sign is a manufacturing tool. The small stone ax, stone hammer, wood bow and wood, and the simple rough tool of the leather, the simple rough tool of the leather is the pioneer of the machine. From the manufacturing simple tool to the manufacture of modern machinery, the manufacturing is made up of a long process.\nThousands of years ago, human beings have created, for example, with cereals shells and smashing, with oranges and hobs used to raise water, with wheels, sailing in the river, their paddle, \u6a79, rudder Wait. The power used, from the person's own physical strength, develops to the use of animal strength, wind and hydraulic. The materials used have developed from natural stone, soil, wood, leather to artificial materials. The earliest artificial material is ceramic. Ceramics for manufacturing ceramic vessels have been a complete machine with three parts of power, drive and work.\nHumans enter the copper era from the stone era, and then in the Iron Age, the development of the blowers of the blowing furnace will play an important role in the development of blowers. There is a strong strong blower to enable the metallurgical furnace to get enough furnace temperature to refine metal from ore. In China 1000 BC, there has been a blower for casting in 900 years, and gradually evolved from human blowing to animal strength and hydraulic blow.\nAs early as BC, China has applied complex gear systems in the guide car, and applied a 10-handed cross-rigor in the incense burner. The ancient Greece has a cylindrical gear, a conical gear and a worm drive. However, the relationship between gear transmission transient speed and tooth shape, the choice of toothed curve until the 17th century has a theoretical statement. Hand-shaking and pedal agencies are the pioneer of crank links, with a long history in all civilizations, but the form, exercise and power of the crank link mechanism is the achievement of modern mechanics.\nMechanics as a course in the early 19th century in the 19th century, in the first time, the first time in the first time in the University of Technology (Paris Engineering College). [Source Request] Through theoretical research, people can accurately analyze various machinery, including complex spatial linkage mechanisms, and can further integrate new institutions as needed.\n\nModern [edit]\n Space shuttle mechanical engineer\nBefore the 15-16th century, the development of mechanical engineering was slow. But in the practice of Millennium, it has accumulated considerable experience and technical knowledge in mechanical development, and has become an important potential for the development of mechanical engineering. After the 17th century, capitalism appeared in English, law and Western Europe, and commodity production began to become the center of society. Many high talents of mechanical traits and intellectuals with production concepts are committed to improving the work machinery and new power machinery required for various industries - steam engines. In the late 18th century, the application of steam engine was promoted from the mining industry to the textile, flour, metallurgy and other industries. The main materials for making machinery are gradually modified from wood, but it is difficult to use manually processed metal. The mechanical manufacturing industry began to form and became an important industry in decades. The mechanical engineering has gradually developed into atrically guided, systematic and independent engineering techniques that have become atrioretical, systematic and independent engineering techniques. The mechanical engineering is the main technical factors that contribute to the 18-19th century industrial revolution and the large number of capitalist machinery production.\n\nDynamic machinery development [edit]\nPower is an important factor in developing production. In the late 17th century, with the improvement and development of various machinery, with the increase in the need for coal and metal ore, people feel that the production of human and animal is not able to increase production to a new stage. In British, textile, grinding and other industries are increasingly located on the river, using water wheel to drive work machine. However, there is a certain scale of coal mines, tin mines, aluminum mines, iron mines, copper mines, silver deposits, and gold mines, still can only be upgraded and excluded with a large amount of animal.\nUnder such production needs, the air steam engine of Thomas Newcomen will drive the mine drain pump in the early 18th century. However, the fuel consumption rate of this steam engine is very high, basically applied to coal mines.\nIn 1765, British Watt invented the steam machine with separate condenser and reduced the fuel consumption rate. In 1781, Waart created a steam engine that provides rotation power, expanded the application range of steam engines. The invention and development of steam engines make mineral and industrial production, railways and shipping are mechanically dynamic.\nThe steam machine is almost the only power source in the 19th century. However, the steam engine and its boiler, condenser, cooling water system are large, cumbersome, and it is very inconvenient. At the end of the 19th century, the power supply system and the motor began development and promotion. At the beginning of the 20th century, the motor has replaced the steam engine in industrial production, which has become the basic driving force for driving various work machines. Mechanization of production has been inseparable from electrification, while electrification is mechanized to play a role.\nThe steam engine is applied as the original motion station. At the beginning of the 20th century, there was a high-efficiency, high speed, high-power steam turbine, and a large and small power of various hydraulic resources were also emerged, and the vigorous development of the power supply system was promoted.\nThe internal combustion engine invented in the late 19th century has been improved year by year, which is small, high efficiency, easy to manipulate, and can start at any time. It is first used to drive on land work machines without power supply, and later used in vehicles, mobile machinery (such as: tractors), aircraft and ships, and started for railway vehicles in the mid-20th century. The steam engine is no longer an important power machine under the crust of steam turbines and internal combustion engines. Internal combustion engines and later invented gas turbine engine, development of jet engines, or one of the basic technical factors such as ships, aircraft, spacecrafts.\n\nDevelopment of machining technology [edit]\nBefore the industrial revolution, most of the machinery is wood structure, and is made by woodworking. Metal (mainly copper, iron) is only used to make small parts on the instrument, lock, clock, pump and wood structure. Metal processing mainly relying on the mechanism of the mechanic to achieve the required accuracy. The promotion of steam engine power devices, and the development of large-scale machinery such as mines, metallurgical, vehicles, ships, aircraft, more and more metal parts, which require forming processing and cutting and machining, more and more, and the accuracy of the requirements The higher. The metal material applied from copper, the iron is developed to steel. Machinery includes fitter, drilling machine, lathe, milling machine, grinding machine, sawing machine, punch, planer, mold, casting, forging, sheet metal, welding and heat treatment, etc., and cutting technology, tools, measuring, etc., rapid development, It is guaranteed the supply of mechanical equipment required for various industries.\nThe development of social economy has soared on mechanical products. The increase in mass production and the progress of precision machining technology have promoted a large number of production methods (parts interchangeability, professional division of labor and collaboration, flow water processing lines and water distribution lines, etc.).\nSimple interchange parts and professional division of labor work have emerged in ancient times. In mechanical engineering, interchangeability reflects the bolts and nuts produced by Henry Mozley in 1797 using their created threaded lathes. At the same time, American engineers were produced with interchangeability production methods, showing the feasibility and superiority of interchangeability. This production method is gradually promoted in the United States, forming a so-called \"American production method\".\nBefore the 18th century, the mechanical production of the mechanical trammunications was made by experience, intuition and craftsmanship, and there was little contact with science. By the 18th-19th century, under the promotion of emerging capitalist economies, people who master scientific knowledge began to pay attention to production, and the tramptoms of direct production were started to learn scientific and cultural knowledge. The exchanges between them have achieved great results. During this process, a complete set of basic theories surrounding the mechanical engineering.\nThe power machine is first combined with the advanced science at the time. The inventors of the steam engine T. Saverry, Watt applies physicist D. Papan and J. Black 's theory. On the basis of steam engine practice, physicist S. Kano, W.j.m. Lanjin and Kelvin established a new science-thermodynamics. The most important theoretical foundation of the internal combustion engine is France's AeBDe Rosha found in 1862, Nikolaus August Otto applied Luosha's theory, thoroughly improved his roarness, noise, large noise, Thermally efficient internal combustion engine has laid the position of the internal combustion engine. Other, such as: steam turbines, gas turbines, and turbines, etc., are developed under theoretical guidance, and theory is also improved and improved in practice.\n\nModern [edit]\nPrior to the industrial revolution, most projects were limited to military and urban development. Engineers engaged in military, responsible for the development of war tools and systems; engineers engaged in urban development are responsible for architecture and ground facilities. In the early 19th century, the mechanical engineer became an emerging industry, which is responsible for providing the driving force required for industrial machinery and driving machinery. In 1818, the first professional civil engineer organized its establishment, while mechanical engineers were also organized in 1847.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Ford, h. In the automotive manufacturing, it created a pipeline wiring. A large number of production technologies plus Taylor, F.W. The scientific management method founded in the 19th century, making the production efficiency of vehicles and other large production mechanical products quickly reached the height of the past could not imagine.\nIn the middle of the 20th century, the main feature of machining is: continuously improve the machining speed and accuracy of the machine tool, reducing the dependence on hand technique; develop less long-cut processing technology; improving the mechanization and automation of forming processing, cutting and assembly. Automated automation from mechanical control development to automation of electrical control and fully automation of computer program control, until unmanned workshop and unmanned factory; use numerical control machine tools, processing centers, group technologies, development of flexible processing systems, make medium and small batch, more The production efficiency of variety production is raised to a level near a large number of production; research and improve the formation and cutting technology of new metal and non-metallic materials.\n\nMechanical Engineer Society [edit]\nThe earliest mechanical engineering group in the world is the British Mechanical Engineer Imeche. Founded in 1847, the first chairman is George Stephen, a railway locomotive. [1] The establishment of the British Mechanical Engineer Society marks that mechanical engineering has established an independent discipline, and the mechanical engineer is recognized as a respected title by society.\nPrior to this, people engaged in mechanical manufacturing, use and repair, known as the machines, and the social status is not high.\nAs the mechanical manufacturing is growing as an independent industrial sector, the mechanical engineer students have established, which largely reflects the initial stage of the machinery industry, and the business owners and technical staff are free to carry out academic exchanges, safeguard common interests, and strive for improvement. The common wishes of social status.\nAt the same time of the West, Mechanical Engineer Society and Mechanical Engineering, it has played an important role in promoting discipline development and improving the social status of mechanical engineers. The British Mechanical Engineer Society has the right to assess engineers according to national laws and awarded the title of a franchisee.\nThe German Engineer Society (VDI) was established in 1856, and the main activities range are mechanical engineering. It is in a leading position in the development of guided technical documents. The US Mechanical Engineer Society (ASME) was established in 1880. It undertakes the formulation of US machinery industry standards. The Japanese Mechanical Engineer Society (JSME) was established in 1897. Indian Mechanical Engineer Society was established in 1920. China (Huimin) National Mechanical Engineering Society was established in 1936.\nThe main activities of various mechanical engineers Society are substantially the same, such as organize academic seminars, coordinate scientific research tasks, popularize scientific and technical knowledge. At the same time, Will develop their respective advantages according to the different context of their respective social and historical background, so that the mechanical engineers of all countries have different characteristics.\nIn terms of organizational construction, the Mechanical Engineering Society has been explored, on the one hand, establishing a professional branch or a professional committee, conducting professional academic activities, and establishing regional branches, organizing regional academic activities. This organizational structure has gradually developed into common characteristics and traditions of various mechanical engineering society. As mechanization extends to all industrial sectors, the field is constantly expanding, and the mechanical engineering students of various countries are many historical, largest, largest members, the most widely accepted academic groups.\nIn the 20th century, especially since the Second World War, various mechanical engineering academic groups have a large-scale development. International academic exchanges are also increasingly frequent. Some professional branches of mechanical engineering have established a world-oriented academic group, such as: International Welding Society (IIW), International Foundry Society (Ciatf), International Material Heat Treatment Federation (IFHT), International Machine Theory and Institutional Association (IFTOMM), International Pressure Vessel Council (ICPV), International Nondestructive Test Council (ICNDT), International Tribology Council (ITC), International Production Engineering Research Association (CIRP), etc.\nWith the various branches of mechanical engineering and adjacent professional disciplines, a group of international engineering groups, such as the 1950 International Association Union (UITA), 1958 World Engineering Commonwealth WFEO, etc., participated in engineering organizations in nearly 100 countries and has obtained the support of UNESCO. In these international engineering organizations, mechanical engineering disciplines and academic groups are often a backbone.\n\nMechanical Engineering Education [Edit]\n Mechanical Design Competition of Carnegiemelon University\n Simulated design car production line\n Factory automation, mechanical production machinery\nMechanical engineering is the nature of material, application mechanics, material mechanics, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, structural mechanics, destruction mechanics, elastic mechanics, plastic force, motor electronics and calculations, design and manufacture various types of mechanical products and systems, such as: Engines, machinery, instruments, consumer goods and machinery, hydraulic, thermal or thermal systems. With the current chance of technology; computer-aided mapping and computer-aided manufacturing technology have been widely used. In general, mechanical engineers will focus on a certain aspect, such as hydraulic, heat transfer, heat machine, motor, electromechanical integration, control system, machinery manufacturing, air conditioning, refrigeration, lifts and elevators, or certain types of products Such as: machine, propulsion system, mechanic and maneuvers.\nThe working object of mechanical engineering is a dynamic machinery, which means that its work will have changed. This change is sometimes randomly and not foreseeable; the material of the actual application is not completely uniform, there may be various defects; the processing accuracy has a certain deviation. Compared with civil engineering with static structures for work objects, various problems in mechanical engineering are more difficult to use theoretical exact solution. Therefore, early mechanical engineering only uses simple theoretical concepts, combining practical experience. Design calculations rely more empirical formulas; in order to ensure safety, they are contrasting. As a result, the machine is cumbersome and large, high cost, low productivity, and energy consumption.\nSince the 18th century, design calculations have continuously improved accuracy from two aspects: in terms of material strength, from early static strength divided by the safety factor (considering all the intra-accuracy and dispersible factors), improvement To consider the fatigue of materials (the second half of the 19th century); from the unlimited fatigue life of the material, it is changed to a limited life design according to the actual service life (the first half of the 20th century); from the consideration of the material, there is no crack, It is based on the basis of breaking mechanics, considering the strength and life of crack materials. In terms of structural mechanics analysis, various force and torques are determined from application experience formulas and simplified mechanical analysis to develop complicated mechanical analysis and mathematical calculation methods.\nIn the 20th century, various experimental stress analysis methods occurred. It has been able to measure the stress of the model and the actual parts in the experimental method, and the necessary adjustments may be made when the stress is too low. After the second half of the 20th century, people began to apply the rapid and reliable numerical calculation of finite element methods and electronic computers, for complex mechanical and components, components, torque, strength, stress, strain, etc. For mechanical or elements that have sufficient practice or experimental data, statistical techniques can be used to scientifically, according to the requirements of reliability, or according to the actual situation of machinery (actual quality, actual use conditions, etc.) Judging its reliability and life. However, in many mechanical engineering work, some empirical methods, empirical formulas and empirical coefficients, but the scientific components are increasing, and the empirical ingredients are constantly decreasing.\n\nSpecialization and integration of the mechanical department [edit]\nIn the 19th century, the total knowledge of mechanical engineering is also very limited. In the European university college, it is usually compliant with water conservancy projects, civil engineering and construction projects as a discipline, known as civil engineering, the second half of the 19th century I have gradually become an independent discipline.\nIn the 20th century, with the development of mechanical engineering technology, the growth of the knowledge of knowledge, the mechanical engineering began to decompose, and specialized branch disciplines have emerged. This trend of decomposition has reached the highest peak during the mid-20th century, that is, during the front and rear period of the Second World War. Due to the total knowledge of mechanical engineering has expanded to far from all, certain specialization is essential.\nHowever, excessive specialization has caused excessive segmentation, vision stenosis, and unordered the whole structure and overall scale of engineering, and reduces the scope of technology exchange, hindering the emergence of new technologies and the overall advancement of technology, changes to external conditions (The emergence of new technologies, new materials and new products, new environmental protection regulations, raw materials and energy supply and price changes, and personal work mobilization, job improvement, etc.)\nClosed professional experts have experienced knowledge, considering problems, and cooperate with coordination in collaborative work, it is not conducive to continuing self-study. Therefore, since the 20th century, a comprehensive trend has occurred. People pay more attention to basic theory, broaden their professional fields, combined and differentiated throughout.\nComprehensive \u2192 Professional Differentiation \u2192 Reproduction Recycling Recycling is a reasonable and necessary process for knowledge development. However, comprehensive recovery cannot be a simple merge of existing professional, but a comprehensive level of higher levels, the purpose is to better play professional knowledge. Experts from different professionals have exquisite expertise, and have sufficient comprehensive knowledge to understand, understand the problems of other disciplines and the overall appearance of the project, to form a strong collective that works with each other. It is the main topic of cultivating mechanical engineering talents in the new technical revolutionary era.\nComprehensive and professional is multi-level. There is a comprehensive and professional contradiction in the mechanical engineering; comprehensive and professional issues are also equally comprehensively engineered. In all knowledge of humans, including social science, natural science and engineering technology, there is also a higher level, more macro-integrated and professional issues.\n\nBasiscipline [edit]\nIn the United States, mechanical engineering courses are regulated by ABET to ensure that graduates have the minimum cognition of relevant projects. So although the content of the courses provided by each institution is different, the general mechanical engineering course includes at least the following basic subjects [2] [3]:\n\nCalculus;\nEngineering Mathematics;\nEngineering Materials;\nEngineering Drawing;\nEngineering Design;\nIndustrial Engineering;\nMECHANICAL MATERIALS;\nMechanical Drawing (MECHANICAL DRAWIN);\nMechanical Design;\nMechanical manufacturing;\nNon-traditional processing, special processing;\nCasting, Forging, Mold (MOLD);\nMeasurement, product management;\nMeasurement and instruments and instruments (INSTRUMENTATION ANDMERMENT);\nApplication Mechanics - Static and Applied-Statics and Mechanics Of Applied-Dynamics;\nSolid Mechanics (MECHANICS OF SOLID);\nMechanics and Materials and Stregth of Materials and Stregth of Materials;\nThermodynamics;\nFluid mechanics (MECHANICS OF FLUID);\nElastic Mechanics (Mechanics Of Elasticity);\nDestructive mechanics;\nPlastic force;\nKINMATICS OF Machinery;\nHydraulics, Pressure and Pneumatic (Pneumatics);\nHeat transfer, heat transfer, heat treatment, heat machine, heat flow, energy conversion, cooling and air conditioning\nMotor, electromechanical integration, automatic control, control theory and microprocessor;\nComputer Aided Design (CAD) and Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM);\nSolid mold (Modelling Of solid)\nService area and work content of mechanical engineering [Source Request] [Edit]\nService area [edit]\nThe service sector of mechanical engineering has broadly and more, where mechanical, tools, so that energy and material production are used, and there is no need for mechanical engineering services. Summary, modern machinery projects have five services.\n\nDeveloping and providing energy conversion machine, including various power machines that convert natural mechanical energy, acoustic energy, light energy, thermal energy, electrical energy, magnetic energy, chemical energy, and fluid pressure into mechanical energy suitable for application, and convert mechanical energy to The energy conversion machine required for other energy (mechanical energy, acoustic energy, light energy, thermal energy, electrical energy, magnetic energy, chemical energy, and fluid pressure, etc.).\nDeveloping and providing machinery for producing various products, including agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fishery machinery and mine machinery applied to the first industry, and various heavy industry machinery and light industrial machinery applied to the secondary industry.\nIt is developed and provided mechanical, including transportation machinery, material handling machinery, office machinery, medical machinery, ventilation, heating and air conditioning equipment, dust removal, purification, and sound.\nTo develop and provide machinery and personal life, such as sewing machine, washing machine, dewater, dryer, hair dryer, electric fan, refrigerator, air, heating, water heater, watch, camera, camera, video recorder, radio , Television, telephone, mobile phone, data machine, computer, sports equipment, etc.\nDevelop and provide a variety of mechanical weapons.\nWork content [edit]\nRegardless of which field serving, the work content of the mechanical engineering is basically the same, and according to its working properties can be divided into six aspects.\n\nEstablishment and development can be practically and directly applied to the engineering theory of mechanical engineering. This is mainly: engineering mechanics, solid mechanics and fluid mechanics of research and exercise; research on the performance of metal and non-metallic materials and its application of engineering materials; research materials under external force, stress, strain, etc. Research of thermal energy generation, conduction and conversion of combustion, thermal transmission and thermodynamics; research on friction, wear and lubrication; research institutionalism between relative movements between components in machinery; study various types of mechanical components with independent functions Work principle, structure, design, and computational mechanical principles and mechanical parts; study metal and non-metallic forming and cutting metal processes and non-metallic processes.\nResearch, design and develop new mechanical products, continuously improve existing machinery products and production of new generation of mechanical products to meet current and future needs.

Mechanical is generally complex products made from many unique forming and processing of precision parts, production batches, single parts and small batches, and medium batches, large numbers, until a large number of production, sales objects all industries and individuals , Family, and sales may have a lot of fluctuations under the influence of social and economic conditions. Therefore, the management and operation of mechanical manufacturing are particularly complex and difficult. The research of commercial production management, planning and operation, etc. is also to start starting in the machinery industry. Production engineering, industrial engineering, etc., before become an independent discipline, it was a branch of mechanical engineering.\nApplication of Mechanical Products. This aspect includes selection, ordering, acceptance, installation, adjustment, operation, maintenance, repairing and retrofitting various industries, to ensure the reliability and economy of mechanical products in long-term use.\nResearch on the problem of excessive consumption of environmental pollution and natural resources produced in the manufacture of mechanical products, especially in the use of environmental pollution and natural resources. This is a particularly important task for modern mechanical engineering, and its importance is increasing.\nMechanical engineering talents [edit]\nScientists and scholars [edit]\nSince most of the mechanical engineering areas, most scientists and scholars choose one of the branches in the field of masterpiece, and conduct a highly basic theoretical research or extensive application scientific research.\n\nEngineer [edit]\nProfessional engineers must have logical thinking, systematically study and analyze problems. Due to the work of mechanical engineering often emphasize overall cooperation, engineers must be good at getting along with people, and clearly explain the arrangement of production procedures. In order to cooperate with the rapid development of technology, engineers must continue to repair, pay attention to the development of new technology such as computer-assisted mapping computer-assisted manufacturing. Common title is:\n\nMechanical design engineer\n2. Mechanical process engineer\n3. Equipment engineer\n4. R & D engineer\n5. Warlock engineer\n6. Temperature engineer\n7. Electrical engineer\n8. Servo Institutions and Control Engineers\ntechnician [edit]\nSince the technician must clearly master the idea of \u200b\u200bengineers and put it into practice, he must have the technical knowledge required. In addition, he must have good judgment and organizational skills. Technicians who are supervised and must have to stimulate their work and clearly express their guidelines. He should also continue to repair the latest technology knowledge.\n\nMechanic [edit]\nThe mechanic must be pragmatic and loved to make items with hands and tools. In addition to the basic theoretical knowledge, he also has the practical technology required for its work.\n\nSalary and job prospects [edit]\nWith the increasingly prosperity of the economy, manufacturing and service industry demand has received a large number of mechanical engineers and technicians that have been specially trained. Although new technology leads to automation of production procedures and computerization, most of the procedures related to industrial operations and instruments are still based on mechanical principles. In view of the development of various industries, it is believed that the demand for mechanical technicians at all levels will continue to grow.\n\nBranch Discipline [edit]\nMechanical engineering can be seen as a collection of all machinery. The following is a major course with a short intergeneration and common application description. Some of them are characteristic of mechanical engineering. Mechanical engineers are mostly used by methods and techniques learned from these and other more professional courses. Among them, the application mechanics (static and dynamics), material mechanics and fluid mechanics are three major protagonists. More professional courses are in the research institute.\n\nWave force\nLinear elastic\nStructural Analysis or Failure Theory: A branch in the field of mechanical engineering, which provides contributions to the failure of inspection of objects and how to occur. There are two cases of structural failure. There is still: static failure, dynamic failure and fatigue failure.\nFatigue analysis\nReliability analysis\nFinite element method\nReverse Engineering\nSolid mechanics [edit]\nMain entry: Mechanics\n\n\n\nRelated electronic tutorial in Wiki Textbook: Solid Mechanics\n Moiren, an analysis method, which is often used to analyze the pressure of the component.\nThe solid power is intended to explore the balance, movement and rotational movement, vibration, stress, strain, friction, plastic flow and damage, etc., respectively, corresponding courses, such as: Static Studies , Dynamics, material mechanics, elastic mechanics, plastic force, damage mechanics, damage mechanics, fracture, contact mechanics, lubrication theory, corrosion, etc. The analysis of solid strength is also the basic consideration of any design. Designing machinery must be the balance consideration of solid strength, sequential to vibration, intensity, etc., sometimes careful considerations, such as fatigue, impact, high temperature Variable strength, etc. Then, if the fluid machine is calculated, then its energy source is added to the heat machine, and the thermodynamic calculation is added to improve the efficiency. If the electric energy is calculated by the motor, then the design of the control system is completed. Work, then it is mechanical manufacturing, industrial engineering, commercial management, business economics, etc. It can be seen from this sequence to the top of the top rushing mechanical engineering.

Design control systems must be designed for manufacturing convenience and economy. It is necessary to know the market status and Demand psychology, it is also necessary to use all possible use safety and more user-friendly, the mission is significant, because it is a sense of realistic intermediate role. This is the main reason for the compulsory course, and a \"person\" usually cannot be proficient in these, so it has highlighted the importance of scientific and technological integration. Related Discipline:\n\nMachine principle\nInstitutionalism\nMechanical mechanics\nMechanical material\nMechanical Drawing\nMechanical manufacturing [edit]\nThe manufacturing class is a comprehensive subject, which requires solid mechanics (application mechanics (static, dynamics), material mechanics), thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, thermogravure, electrical, magnetology, chemistry, etc., is achieved as finished products. This manufacturing process must meet the requirements or strength of the finished product that can be produced, manufactured by the finished product, and can be systematically, automated production. In addition, manufacturing and experiments are the most useful use of measurement techniques and free to say. The procedure of manufacturing is substantially material surface treatment, heat treatment, mold, casting, forging, welding, powder metallurgy, cutting principle, normal temperature plastic processing, high temperature plastic processing and automation manufacturing system.

These systems are generally between microns to millimeters. Daily physics experience in this size is often not applicable. For example, because the area of \u200b\u200bthe microcomputer system is much larger than the mechanical system than the normal daily life, its surface phenomenon such as static electricity, moisturizing, etc., such as: inertia or heat capacity, etc. They are generally manufactured by techniques similar to the production of semiconductors such as surface micro-processes, body micro-machined techniques. These include modified silicon machining methods such as calendering, electroplating, wet etching, dry etching, electric spark processing, and the like.\nThe size of the company producing a microelectromechanical system is different. Big companies focus on producing a large amount of cheap system for vehicles, biomedica or electronics industries. Successful small companies focus on production innovation technology. All of these companies are committed to research and development. With the development of the microelectromechanical system, the complexity and efficiency of the microelectromechanical system are constantly increasing.\n\nNiM Technology [edit]\n NASA computer, molecular gear, Nai Machine\nNami Technology is an emerging application science, and its purpose is to study the design method, composition, characteristics, and application of matter and equipment when studying in Nai meters. Nimm Technology is many of the technical secondary classifications such as biological, physics, chemistry, and the United States's national Nim Technology launch plan will be defined as \"1 nanometers to 100 nano size, especially existing technology in Nimei. Extension during scale. Nami Technology's world is atomic, molecular, polymer, quantum dots, and polymer collection, and is controlled by the surface effect, such as Van Defarks, hydrogen bond, charge, ion bond, covalent bond, hydrophobicity, The inertial and inertial effects such as inertia and inertia and turbulence are smaller can be ignored. For example, when the scale of the surface area has increased dramatically, it has opened a scientific and new possibility such as a surface-oriented.\nThe continuous exploration of tinity is to make new tools, such as: atomic force microscope and scanning tunnel microscope. Combining an accurate procedure such as electron beam gradient, these devices will allow us to function precisely and generate a nano structure. Nano material, whether it is made from top to bottom (blocking the block to the nanometer scale, the main method is to get as small as possible by cutting, etching, grinding, etc. (such as super-precision processing, difficulty) from the block The tiny structure must be precise). Or is made from bottom to top (a large structure, the main method is chemically synthesized, self-assembly, and fixed-point assembly. The difficulty is that the macro is to achieve efficient and stable The quality is not just a further tiny. The energy quantization of electrons in the object has also begun to have an effect on the properties of the material, referred to as quantum scale effects, describing the physical properties of electrons within the material in the scale. This effect Not because the scale is generated by the giant gain, it is really important in the nanometers. When the substance is in the nanometer scale, it will have a big difference in giants, for example: opaque The substance will become transparent (copper), the inert substance becomes a catalyst (platinum), stable substance becomes flammable (aluminum), the solid becomes liquid (gold) at room temperature, the insulator becomes a conductor ( ).\nNami Technology's magic comes from its quantum and surface phenomenon in the nanometer scale, and therefore there may be many important applications and many interesting materials.\n\nFuture Prospect [Source Request] [Edit]\nIn terms of energy, in recent improvement of nuclear fission power devices, develop solar energy, geothermal, tidal energy, sea water, etc., can reduce dependence on fossil energy of non-regenerative fossils. From a long-term point of view, nuclear fusion is very promising and almost endless future energy. Based on the current and future achievements of nuclear physics, mechanical engineering and other engineering technologies, the development and promotion of nuclear polyvert force devices in the 21st century may completely solve the world's energy problems. Use this new energy to eliminate carbon dioxide pollution to the atmosphere.\nThe amount of metal mineral in the middle and sea water is extremely rich. As long as the process of mining and mineralization and mineralization, the performance of the mining, the properties of the mineral machinery can reduce the ore grade energy-utilized, and the metal waste can be fully recycled. Under the conditions of sufficient energy supply, the metal material resources are not scarce.\nAfter the coal, oil, gas, etc. is no longer used in a large amount of fuel as a fuel, and the supply of non-metallic materials can also be reached long-term guarantees.\nEnvironmental pollution sources such as chemical engineering, metallurgical engineering and other production processes, improve process, increase purification machinery and facilities, and improve their purification efficiency, in technology can be eliminated.\nMechanical Engineering has always increased production, improve labor productivity, and improves the economics of production, and develops new mechanical products to improve the recent interests of humans. In the future, the development of new products will reduce resource consumption, development of clean renewable energy, governance, and deepening environmental pollution as a target task of ultra-economic.\n\nMechanical Engineering and Artificial Intelligence [Edit]\nMain entry: automatic control and artificial wisdom\n NASA Mars detecting vehicle\nMechanical engineering is traditional engineering technology. Machinery can accomplish the person with both hands and binocular and the double-foot bulls directly and cannot be completed directly, and complete faster, better. Modern mechanical engineering creates more and more intricate and increasingly complex machinery, making many fantasies in the past become reality. Human now has been able to go upstream sky and universe, dive the ocean deep, oscillogenous, neighboring cells and molecules. Emerging electronic computer hardware, software science has enabled human beings to strengthen and partially replace the human brain technology means, which is artificial intelligence. This new development has shown a huge impact, and it will continue to create miracles that people can't imagine in the future.\nThe growth of human wisdom does not reduce the role of both hands, but the opposite is required to have more, more delicate and more complex work, thereby promoting the functionality of the hand. The practice of hand is in turn promotes the wisdom of the human brain. During the entire evolution of humans, and during the growth of each person, brain and hands are evolving to each other. The relationship between artificial intelligence and mechanical engineering is approximately the relationship between brain and hands. Its difference is only that manually intelligent hardware needs to be manufactured using mechanical manufacturing. In the past, various mechanical deposits were unable to open, and their reaction rate and operational accuracy were subject to a very slow human brain and nervous system. Artificial intelligence eliminates this limit. Mechanical engineering can make full use of this new huge possibility. Mutual promotion between computer science and mechanical engineering, parallel advancement will enable mechanical engineering to start a new round of great development at a higher level.\n\nSee [edit]\n\n\nEngineering theme\nSimple machinery\nFamous mechanical engineer list\nInventive list\npatent\nPrecision machine (Japanese: precision machine)\nReference [edit]\n\n\n^ Past Presidents of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

Use energy through control and adaptation enables it to become a key development in human society. Can not be used in any society to avoid the use of energy. In industrialized countries, the development of energy resources in agriculture, transportation, garbage collection, information technology and communications are prerequisites for developed society. Since the industrial revolution, there are more and more energy use, and it also brings some serious problems, some of which, such as global warming to currently have potentially serious risks in the world. In addition, due to economic activities, such as intensiveness, energy efficiency, dependence, security and price, etc., such as manufacturing and transportation industries.\nEnergy resources in human social context: energy resources as synonyms of energy, generally referring to metrics, such as fuel, oil processing products and electricity. These are all available source of energy because they can easily convert to other energy sources for specific use.\nIn nature, energy can take several different forms: heat, electricity, radiation, chemical energy, etc. Many of these forms can be easily converted to another, such as using devices; batteries used from chemical energy to electrical energy. But most of our existing energy comes from the sun. Great potential energy elaboration can be represented by the famous formula E = MC2.\nModern energy can generally be divided into two categories: renewable energy and alternative energy sources.\n\ntable of Contents\n\n1 energy\n2 energy crisis\n\n2.1 International Energy Agency\n2.2 Traditional energy category and limitations\n\n2.2.1 Development of nuclear energy\n2.2.2 New Energy and Renewable Energy\n2.2.3 Source of energy\n\n\n\n\n3 ginseng\n4 reference\n5 external link\n\n\nEnergy [edit]\nThe production and consumption of energy resources is very important for the world economy. Whether it is producing goods, transportation, allowing computers and other equipment to function properly, all economic activities require energy resources, which can be said to be one of the important production materials in the industrial age.\n\nEnergy crisis [edit]\nMain entry: energy crisis\nBecause energy supply shortages or prices affect the economy. This usually involves shortages of oil, electricity or other natural resources. Economic and political instability may also lead to an energy crisis, like 1973 oil crisis and 1979 oil crisis. When the global oil mining rate reaches the highest (ie, petroleum peak) may contribute to another energy crisis.\n\nInternational energy institution [edit]\nEnergy Forum in Developed Countries established in 1974. Composed of 23 countries such as Australia, Canada, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany. The Member Government cooperates to coordinate energy policies and share energy supply in the incident of the oil crisis. And use development alternative energy sources to solve supply and demand issues and environmental issues in energy structures.\n\nTraditional energy category and limitations [edit]\nNon-renewable energy - oil, natural gas, nuclear energy, etc. depending on the source of total limit\nRenewable energy - hydraulic, wind, solar energy, etc. close to unlimited energy sources\nDevelopment of nuclear energy [edit]\nNuclear power generation is the main application of nuclear energy. From the late 1950s to the 1980s, the world nuclear power began to develop rapidly. It is technique for heating and power generation using a nuclear fission released. The nuclear industry will generate radioactive waste, and low-order radioactive waste should be monitored for about 300 years. After the radioactivity is gradually reduced, it can determine its safety stability; and high-order radioactive waste, the radioactive high-order radioactive waste, requires a long-term proper management and disposal. To stand the extent to which the radioactive attenuation is comparable to the background radiation. [1]\n\nNew energy and renewable energy [edit]\nSolar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, biomass energy, tidal energy, and water energy. In addition to biomass, all are non-combustion energy, also known as clean energy or green energy.\n\nSource of energy [edit]\nIn general, energy comes from three ways: 1, solar radiation. The pathway is embodied in the Earth's surface by sunlight, plant energy, fossil fuel, surface temperature difference, moon reflective, water vapor evaporation cycle. The total energy of the sun radiation is limited. At present, the current extraction of such energy exceeds energy supplement; 2. Earth rotation. This route typically includes geothermal, magnetic, and wind energy, water flow, and tidal, etc., usually renewable energy. The atrivol is dissipated during the Earth's mutation, and occasionally manifesse as an explosive volcanic eruption or earthquake destructive situation; 3, nuclear fusion, nuclear fission. This route includes renewable energy in the traditional sense. The radiation energy can also be generated while generating a by-product.\n\nSee [edit]\n\n\nEnergy theme\nRenewable energy theme\nNuclear technology theme\nVarious people's energy consumption in all countries\nRenewable energy commercialization\ncombustion\nPeople's Republic of China Energy Policy\nAmerican Energy Policy (English: Energy Policy of the United States)\nNational nuclear energy development\nReference [edit]\n\n\n^ Vandenbosch, Robert, And Susanne E.

(discuss)\nSpecifications and mapping research and estimates and estimate ground geometries, global shapes and earth gravity fields, and measure the geometric distribution of natural objects and artificial facilities in Earth, the theoretical and technical disciplines of various scale maps are measured. The research object of surpassing and mapping is geospatial information such as the morphology, position, gravity distribution of the earth, and thus measuring and mapping can be considered a branch discipline of Earth Science. In recent years, the research object of surveying and mapping has also expanded from the surface of the Earth to the field of access to the anterior space and the internal structure of the earth.\n\ntable of Contents\n\n1 development of mapping\n\n1.1 Cognition of the global shape\n1.2 Development of Drawing Technology\n1.3 Transformation of the instrument\n\n\n2 subject branch\n3 reference materials\n\n\nDevelopment of mapping [edit]\nThe Progressive Progressive Progressive Relying on Humans' Understanding of the Geoplasses, the Improvement of Map Map Technology and the Innovation and Change of Surveying and Mapping Instruments.\nIn the era of ancient history in the world, there is a saying that the Nile and Mappiness is in the Farmland border. In the 7th century BC, Pi Zhong has collected 27 early maps in its \"pipe\" book. In the first 5th century BC, China has made the earliest guide to \"Division\" records in China. In the first 2nd century BC, in \"Historical Records and Summer Ji\", it records that there is a \"left-line rope, right rule\", indicating that there is a simple mapping activity at the time.\n\nCognition of the global shape [edit]\nMain entry: Earth\nThe study of the study is the earth, and the understanding of the shape of the global shape is also made in constant changes. Initially people think that the earth is \"Tianyuan Local\", until the 6th century BC Pythagoras and the 4th Century of the BC proposed \"the circle\". In the first century BC, Eltosteney was observed in Alexander, and the length of the miramoa and the radius of the Earth were confirmed that the approach is the initial form of \"radian measurement\". At the end of the 17th century, Newton and Huygens start from the principle of mechanics. It is considered that the earth is two-pole slightly flat oval, called \"surprising\". In the Mid-18th Century, the French Academy of Sciences in South America and Europe confirmed \"surprising\". In the 19th century, with the measured data, Laplas and Gaussian have pointed out that the earth is not perfect. In 1873, Rismin proposed the concept of the geodetic surface to represent the shape of the earth with a gravity equipped with a heavy sea surface surrounding the earth. In 1945, Moro Josky used Earth gravity measurement data to determine the true shape of the earth.\n\nDevelopment of drawing technology [edit]\nMain entry: Map\n Map of geographic big hair\nOne of the results of the surveying and mapping is the map, so the important indication of the development of surpassing is the improvement in the map technology. The earliest map is portrayed on the pottery, copper plate, and reliability is not high. In the first 3ruces of BC, Eltoster first applied the latitude and latitude to the map. In the first 130 BC, the first stage of the Western Han Dynasty has \"Topographic Map\" and \"Wrun Map\", which is the earliest map found in China. In the 2nd century, Torle Master explained the method of preparing the map in the \"Geody Guide\", and proposed a map projection problem. Since then, the Xi Dynasty, the Xi Jin, established a \"six body\", enabling the reliability of the map. After the Second World War, the computer chart technology developed rapidly and developed into a plurality of geographic information systems.\n\nTransformation of surveying and mapping instruments [edit]\nThe tools of surveying and mapping are the surveying and mapping instruments, so the development of surpassing is inseparable from the innovation of the surveying and mapping tools. Early mapping is a simple rope, torque, etc., 17th century telescope invention, and the mapping tool began to change. In 1617, WiHo Snell invented the \"Triangular Measurement Method\" and creating an angle measurement. In 1730, Xissen developed an angle to use theodolite. After the beginning of the geographic discovery, many countries have studied the instruments for the latitude latitude at sea to position ships. In the 1950s, the first photographic measurement method of Losda. After the 20th century, as the inventions of the plane, the method of aerial photography mapping map appeared. After man-made satellite, satellite positioning techniques (GPS) and remote sensing technology (RS) are widely used, which is known as \"3S technology\" with geographic information system technology (GIS).\n\nSubject branch [edit]\nLand measurement is a discipline that describes the surface of the Earth, also includes determining the earth gravity field and the seabotic terrain.\nPhotographic measurement is a discipline that studies the use of the subject image to reconstruct the spatial position and three-dimensional shape technology.\nMap (drawing) is a scientific research on the theory of studying maps, preparation technology and application methods.\nEngineering measurement is the theory of studying engineering construction and natural resource development.\nMarine testing is the theory of measurement and compiling the ocean and seabed.\nMeasurement data processing is to study how to eliminate various errors and determine the accuracy, how to handle multi-formal measuring data for reasonable forecasting.\nReference [edit]\n\nNingjin, Chen Junyong, Li Deren, Liu Jingnan, Zhang Zuxun, etc. Surveying (Second Edition).

Among them, the aviation refers to the navigation activities of manned or non-carriers in the atmosphere, and space refers to the navigation activities in the universe space outside the atmosphere of the manned or non-carrier [1]. However, the emission and recycling process of the spacecraft must pass the atmosphere, which makes it necessary to contact aerospace and spaceship. The aerospace plane landing in horizontal gliding and the level of empty air planes that are currently developing in countries are being the best embodiment of this connection. The word aerospace also refers to the science necessary for aerospace activities, and it also refers to the various technologies involved in the development of aviation and spacecraft.\nThe Yuan Huang Tie in the Wei, Jin, Southern Dynasties may be the first successful flight; the Soviets, the Soviets, the Soviet Union Alale, the first, the first successful entry of space.\n\ntable of Contents\n\n1 Related Discipline\n2 role and influence\n3 government agency\n4 reference\n5 See\n\n\nRelated Discipline [edit]\nAerospace technology is a highly integrated, interdisciplinary modern science technology, which is based on mechanics, thermodynamics and materials. Electronic technology, automation technology, computer technology, jet propulsion technology, manufacturing process technology, medical, vacuum technology, and low temperature technology have also played an important role. The above discipline intersects each other in aerospace applications, producing some new disciplines, aviation and aerospace technology thus form a complete system. Due to the related art of aircraft, missiles, the development of aerospace technology is often closely related to military applications.\n\nRole and influence [edit]\nAerospace is one of the most active and most influential science and technology fields.

The mining parts are minerals, and the materials mining them include aluminum, coal, diamonds, iron, rare metals, lead, limestone. , Nickel, phosphorus, rock salt, tin, uranium and molybdenum, etc., almost any original substances that cannot be produced by agricultural production are provided by minerals. From broad sense, oil, natural gas, and even groundwater can count the category of mining industry. .\n\ntable of Contents\n\n1 history\n2 steps in mining\n3 mining technology\n4\n5 environmental impact\n6 mining business\n7 mining staff\n8 mining design software\n9 mine machinery\n10 security problem\n11 abandoned mine\n12 reference\n13 external link\n\n\nHistory [edit]\n Mining workers in Tamarak Copper, Michigan, USA\n Bagger 288 Coal Mine Excavator\nIt is known that the earliest human mining site is approximately Swaziland's \"lion points\" according to the radioactivity assay, which is a pocket belonging to 43,000 years ago. At that time, it was a pigment for the mining of the hematite used to do the original people totem. A mine of the original man exploited the mine in Hungary was also discovered in Hungary. In addition, an ancient Egyptian mining mine was found in the Sinai Peninsula.\nIn 1627, the first black gunpowder was used for the first time in Slovakia.\nThe development of the human mining industry is associated with the technical revolution. The stone era uses stone, wood and bone mining, underground mining using wood support. The key force of the bronze era mining tool and support is replaced by bronze, and the iron era is replaced by iron. In the advanced explosive black powder in the late Iron Age. The first industrial revolution replaced the previous humanity into mechanical operations, with steam engines, black powder replaced with nitridified glycerol. The second industrial revolution uses internal combustion engines and TNT, the third industrial revolution began to use nuclear power, and the computer also has more advanced explosives, such as China's total nitrogen anionic salt and metal hydrogen in the United States.\nFrom a broader level, the human production tools and weapons of the stone agents are stone, bones, and wood. The bronze era is replaced by bronze. The iron era is replaced by iron, and explosives have also occurred in the Iron Age. The first industrial revolution took the steam machine into the factory and battlefield. The second industrial revolution brought into internal combustion engine. The third industrial revolution has brought nuclear power, and explosives also turned from black powder from the three industrial revolution from the iron age. Nitrified glycerol, TNT, to all nitrogen and metal hydrogen.\n\nMining step [edit]\nExploring, looking for possible deposits;\nExploration, determine the implication and range of the deposit;\nQuantitatively estimates the quality and burial range of minerals;\nInvasibility study, decide whether there is a mining value;\nEconomic planning for mine construction;\nDevelopment, construction mining, mining minerals;\nSelected minerals;\nRestore land destruction caused by mining.\nMining technology [edit]\n Taiwan Gold Mining Gold Museum\nBasically divided into two forms\n\nSurface mining\nLarge open mining\nquarry\nOrdinary open mining\nSand mine\nCut the mountain mining\nUnderground mining\nShallow mine mining\nOblique well mining\nDirect well mining\nHardstone mining\nDrilling mining\nMining [edit]\nMain entry: mineral project\nMining is a professional science and technology that refines the concentrated valuable minerals, chemical methods and mechanical methods, including pulverization, grinding, gravity distribution method, water selection, etc. After selecting post-selected residue is tailings Need to abandon it. In order to prevent pollution, the disposal of tailings is also a topic of research.\n\nEnvironmental impact [edit]\n Due to the emission of acid wastewater in the open-air coal mine, the deposition of iron oxide in the stream\nThe impact of the mining industry includes soil erosion, the ground settlement, biodiversity damage caused by the pit, and the pollution of the chemical in the mining process.\nModern many countries have strict environmental protection and restoration of the status of the mining industry, ensuring that the mining area should restore the original state, and even better the environment before mining. Using past methods mining, countries that are not stringent in mining industries, the mining industry will cause damage to the environment, while affecting human health.\nThe mining industry will have a considerable impact on the surrounding environment and groundwater. The chemicals will concentrate on contaminated large-scale areas. For example, the coal mines will generate approximately more than 20 toxic chemicals, and they will spread pollution through the channels of discharge and supply water. There are countries with strict control of the law. The mining must have hydrological experts and geologists to carefully study treatment of pollutants. Generally, five separate measures are generally treated: water separation system, contain pollutant wastewater concentrate on the pond, groundwater collection system , Surface water discharge system and isolation system. For water containing acidic contaminants to be discharged directly to the water treatment system.\n\nMining business [edit]\nIt can be engaged in mining careers from private or small companies, but modern mining needs require a lot of capital investment, generally engaged in internationally renowned large companies.\n\nMining personnel [edit]\nSee: Miner\n US iron miner in 1910\n Binzhou miner union mark\nModern mining business is no longer just excavated on the ground and requires special personnel in different fields. Join directly or indirectly to the mining industry, including engineers, laboratory technicians, geologists, environmental scientists, etc., in addition to people who work directly in mines, many professionals are mining industry services, such as accounting, lawyers. , Marketers, public relations personnel, etc., have not counted thousands of mine machinery production and maintenance personnel.\nThe salary of the mining employee is generally higher, especially in the remote area of \u200b\u200bmines, according to the investigation of the US Labor Statistics, the salary of coal mine workers should be 30% of the average salary, university graduates or geological engineers working in the mining industry. The average annual salary is $ 80,000. In the mining industry, you can only work to 46-50 years old, but there are fewer and fewer people who are currently learning mining in college.\n\nMine design software [edit]\nAt present, the largest advancement of mine design is to adopt three-dimensional design software, which is no longer as time consuming as before, as long as exploration staff, geologists, mine engineers and other technical personnel enter the necessary data, software can give optimization Mining design.\n\nMining machinery [edit]\nMining machinery must be able to break and remove any hardness rocks, excavators, drilling rigs, explosives and trucks are essential, especially for open-air mining. Underground mining machine is more complicated and expensive, many internationally famous companies produce continuous mining machinery.\n\nSecurity problem [edit]\nSecurity issues have always been the most important issue in the mining industry, especially for underground mining, although the modern mining industry is more secure than decades, but often has a mine disaster. On March 28, 2010, there were more than 100 people in Wangjialing Coal Mine. [1]\nMine ventilation is the key to safeguarding miners, and ventilation will lead to silicon disease in miners. Especially in the coal mine will cause gas (methane) accumulation, explosion. The ventilation system is completed by the strong exhaust fan, so that the mine is negatively negatively pressed, and the fresh air is input to the mine from other pipes to achieve a good air cycle. In terms of antispectangab materials, the Benxi Lake Coal Mine explosion stops to blow up the wind to the well and lead to more death. [2] [Source reliable? ] [3]\n\nAbandoned mine [edit]\n Obvious warning signs outside Arizona Abandoned Mines: Keeping Distance, staying Survival (Stay Out, Stay Alive.)\nAbout 70-800 abandoned mines in the United States, many also accompanied by abandoned villages and towns (\"ghost towns\"). Experts strongly warned not to enter these mines, don't go there to explore it. Abandoned pits often have accumulation of toxic or suffocating gases, or such as bats, snakes and other toxic animals survival [4], there will be collapse caused by land erosion around the pit, and it is very dangerous to enter these ore pits. Every year, more than a dozen people have been hurt even in these mines, and the US Mine Safety and Health Department initiated a \"staying distance, maintaining survival\" movement, with the purpose of playing and educating children and adults playing and adventure near abandoned mines. It is very dangerous. In the past, there is a risk of fatality and collapse from a high place [5] [4] [6]. An environment full of water is also prone to danger of rescue ambulances [7]. Mining workers are also more susceptible to pulmonary disease.

Oldid = 65280896\" Georg Agrich, \"On the DE RE METALLICA\", this work is known as the work of Western metallurgy\nMetallurgical (English: Metallururgy) belongs to material science, is to study the extraction of metals from ores, and have a discipline of metal materials with a variety of processing methods. Metallurgical studies also study the physics and chemical properties of metals, metal mutants, or mixtures thereof (referred to as alloys). Metallurgy is also a metal technology, and the science of metal, also related to the engineering characteristics of metal parts. Metal manufacturing includes refining metal from ores, as well as metal mixtures (or mixtures of metals and other elements) to produce alloys. Metallurgy and metal processing are different, but metal processing and metallurgical study are related, as the technology is related to technology, medical and medical science.\nMetallurgy can be divided into steel metallurgy (sometimes referred to as black metallurgy) and non-ferrous metallurgy (sometimes referred to as non-ferrous metallurgy). Steel metallurgy is related to iron alloys and its manufacture, rather than iron metal metallurgy, is based on iron-free alloys and its manufacture, iron, cobalt, nickel and its black metal related to alloys Accounting for 95% [1]\n\ntable of Contents\n\n1 English word root and pronunciation\n2 development history\n3 metal extraction\n4 alloy\n5 manufacturing\n\n5.1 metal processing\n5.2 heat treatment\n5.3 surface treatment\n\n\n6 microstructure\n7 branch discipline\n8 related entries\n9 reference\n\n9.1 Reference\n9.2 book\n\n\n\n\nEnglish word root and pronunciation [edit]\nThe metallographic English Metallurururur is originally a word in self-cultivation, refers to extracting metals in ore, and -urgy-urgy expressed as a process or process.

The earliest smelted metal should be gold in the natural world, and there is a small amount of elemental gold in the final stage of the end of the old Stone Age, and time is about 40,000, 40,000 [3]. Silver, copper, tin and iron, will also use natural metal (English: native metel), with metallic processing in early culture [4]. The weapons of Egypt in the first three thousand years of Xiyuan are made of ironing, and they are hailed as \"Daggers from the sky\" [5].\nMetals such as tin, lead and copper, as long as the ore is heated to obtain its metal (the temperature of the copper may be higher may be higher), which is called smelting (English: smelting). Earlie use of smelting metallic metal with smelt is between the first five thousand years to six thousand years, in the archaeological site of Serbia, Plo\u010dnik and Yarmovac. So far, the earliest copper split is Belovode [6] in the Balkans Peninsula, and found a copper ax in the prodeen 5500 in Wen [7]. Other early smelting metals in the first three thousand years in the West Piece, in Palmela, Spain, Spain, the boulder array of British. However, like other prehistoric research, because there may still have new discovery, there may be earlier evidence.\n\n The pu mining area of \u200b\u200bthe ancient Middle East, color: arsenic brown said, tin is blended, copper is used to use red brown, and the gold is blended with yellow, and the silver is used in black, and the yellow area indicates arsenic bronze. English: arsenic bronze, gray area refers to bronze of normal tin.\nThe metal discovered is not an alloy, and about 3,500 of Xiyuan found copper and tin mixed bronze alloy after mixing, this is also a major technical improvement, which has begun the bronze era.\nIron smelting should be more difficult than copper or so much. The smelting method may be that the Herdrons invented 1200 years ago. The secret of the iron era, iron smelting and processing is one of the secrets of the success of the success of the success of the success of the Succession [5 ][8].\nMany different cultures and civilizations also have ironmaking technology, like ancient and middle ancient times, the kingdom of the Near East, ancient Iran, Ancient Egypt, Ju Ni, Anabaria (Turkey, Turkey), Gu Naki, Cartai Base, the ancient European, Rome, Europe, China, India, Japan, etc. in the middle of the ancient Europe. Many metallurgical applications, practices and tools are invested in ancient China, such as blast furnaces, cast iron, hydraulic pestle hammers (English: trip hammer) and double-acting piston fan [9] [10].\nIron Iron was started for a thousand years before the US. The earliest use of the iron-making furnace is an air furnace or a dried iron furnace (Low Shaft Furnace), and the iron furnace (English: bloomery). Put the washed ore with charcoal into the furnace to ignite, using natural gas flow or human bellows to supply oxygen, producing carbon monoxide into iron into iron, and the resulting product is repeated to remove residue. Later, the water-lifting is boomed, and the amount of oxygen supply increases. Therefore, the cross-sectional area of \u200b\u200bthe furnace and furnace can also be increased, and more ore and charcoal can be loaded, and more iron is more iron, due to the limit of human beating, also Replace human resources in hydraulic force. This wrought iron furnace slowly developed into a blast furnace.\nAs the blast furnace increases, charcoal has a shortage of shortage, that is, try to take charcoal with coal, in the 18th century, the British successfully refines coke, and then the furnace temperature increases to increase production. After the steam is appeared, it is used to drive the blower, which increases the amount of heating, rising the furnace temperature, and the yield has increased significantly.\nIn the 16th century, DE RETALLICA describes the knowledge of highly developed mining, metal extraction and metallurgical, and is known as \"the father of metallurgy\". 11].\n\nMetal extraction [edit]\n China Yuan Dynasty with a blower\n Central Slovakia, Aluminum Plant\nExtract metallurgy (English: extractive metallurgy) is a valuable metal proposed in the ore, and is treated with a higher purity metal. In order to extract the metal from the oxide or sulfide of the metal, ore may be treated with reduction, electrolysis or other chemical.\nExtracting metallurgy is mainly focused on metallurgical feed, concentrate (valuable metal oxide or sulfide) and tailings. After mining, large ore will be smashed into small particles, each particles may be a concentrate or an abandoned tail. Subsequent use of other means separate the concentrates and tailings of the particles.\nIf the ore and natural environment permit, ore mining can be replaced with a leaching method (English: in-situ leaching). The Lilt Rati will dissolve the minerals in the ore in solution, then collected solutions, and extract valuable metals.\nSometimes there is more than one valuable metal in the ore. Therefore, tailings can be used to propose other metals. A variety of metals sometimes acquired, thus need to be separated from different metal components.\n\nAlloy [edit]\n Bronze casting\nThe metal commonly used metal includes aluminum, chromium, copper, iron, magnesium, nickel, titanium and zinc, and these metals are often used to make alloys. The correlation study of alloys is mainly in iron-carbon alloy systems, including steel and cast iron. The general carbon steel is suitable for use in low cost, high strength, no need to consider weight and corrosion problems. Dueded cast iron (English: Ductile Iron) is also part of the iron carbon alloy system.\nIf there is a need for corrosion resistance, it is generally used as stainless steel or hot dip galvanized steel. If the high ratio is required, aluminum alloy or magnesium alloy is used.\nIf there is a high corrosion environment, there is no need to have magnetic occasion, a copper nickel alloy, such as a Monel alloy (English: Monel). Nickel-based high-temperature alloys (such as nickel-chromium alloys) will be used in high temperature applications such as turbochargers, pressure vessels and heat exchanters. Very high temperature applications use single crystal material alloys in order to minimize the loss.\n\nManufacturing [edit]\nIn the field of industrial engineering, metallurgy and metal parts are manufactured, including metal or alloys, processing forming, heat treatment and surface treatment of the surface of the article. The purpose of metallurgy is to reach a balance between materials, such as cost, weight, tensile strength, hardness, toughness, resistance, anti-fatigue characteristics, and characteristics at high and low temperature.\nFor the above object, it is also necessary to consider the working environment of the part. For example, in the environment of saline, it is easy to corrode the black metal and some aluminum alloy, and the metal is exposed to the very low temperature environment to become easily brittle, and its toughness decreases. It is therefore more prone to cracks. The metal under cycle load will have metallic fatigue [12], if the stress is fixed, but the temperature is high, it will cause the lessence of metals [13].\n\nMetal processing [edit]\nHere are some metal processes:\n\nMetal casting: Pour the molten metal into a specific shape mold and then cool.\nForging: Use pressure to make the steel blank.\nShear formation (English: flow forming)\nRolling: Send the steel blank into a rolling wheel that gradually becomes small, processed into a metal sheet.\nLeading (English: Cladding (metalworking): Heating the metal powder with a movable thunder bundle (such as the shaft of the tool machine), the molten metal powder is hitting the base, forming a metal pool, when the thunder head After removal, the workpiece can be stacked to form a three-dimensional workpiece.\nSqueeze: Heat plastic metal is formed in the mold by pressing the pressure in the mold.\nSintering: Metal powder first injects into the mold, and then heat it in a non-oxidized environment, making it forms a process.\nMachining: Using the lathe, milling machine and electric drill to the process of solid metal parts.\nCold machining refers to the processing of solid metal parts at normal temperature, which can be introduced into the metal in the metal by one way to improve the strength of the part is referred to as processing hardening (English: Work Hardening). Avoid further deformation.\nThere are many ways for casting, commonly used including overlay casting, molten casting (English: invested method), die casting and continuous casting (English: Continuous Casting).\n\nHeat treatment [edit]\nMetal can adjust its strength, ductility, toughness, hardness or its corrosion resistance. Common heat treatment includes annealing, precipitation hardening, quenching, and tempering [14].\nThe annealing is heating metal, then slow cooling, can release stress in the metal tissue, making the grain change, and it is not easy to rupture when it is hit. The metal after annealing is also easier to cut. Quenching is a fast cooling after heating high carbon steel, and the tissue of steel will form high hardness of Maixi iron, improve the metal's hardness. However, it is necessary to make one place between the hardness and toughness of the steel: the lower the toughness or impact resistance, the lower the hardness, the higher the toughness, the higher the toughness, the lower the hardness. The tempering can release the stress generated during the hardening process, and the tempering will be slightly softened and can withstand the impact without breaking.\nMechanical treatment and heat treatment can sometimes be combined, referred to as thermal mechanical processing (English: thermorechanical processing), which can get better material characteristics, and more efficient. Heat mechanical treatment is commonly used in high alloy special steel, high temperature alloys, and titanium alloys.\n\nSurface treatment [edit]\nElectroplating is a common surface treatment technique, which is a thin layer of other metals such as gold, silver, chromium or zinc, etc., and on the one hand, on the one hand, the resistance of the article can be increased, and the shape can be more beautiful.\nIn addition to using electroplating, surface treatment can also be used, and the performance of its articles is better than plating.\n\nMicrostructure [edit]\n Microstructure of the metallic to observe metal\nGolden Phaseology is the discipline of microstructure and giant structure, which is created by British metallurgist Henry Cleveton Solby (English: Henry Clifton Sorby). In the metaphysics, the sample to be tested is flat and polished to the degree of the mirror, and then the etch etching is added to reveal its structure. Try to observe the optical microscope or electron microscope, the contrast of the image can provide its ingredient, mechanical properties, and the processed processed.\nThe current metallurgical studies are often used to identify unknown materials using crystallographic X-ray diffraction or electron diffraction, and understand the crystal structure of the test. Quantified crystal can calculate the number of different phases in the test, or the degree of strain can be calculated.\n\nBranch Discipline [edit]\nExtraction of metallurgy\nPhysical metallurgy\nMetallurgical Engineering\nArchaeological Metallurgy (English: Archaeometallurgy)\nCarbonyl metallurgy (English: carbonyl metallurgy)\nExperimental Archaeological Metallurgy (English: Experimental Archaeometallurgy)\nRelated entries [edit]\nSmelt\nGray blow\nGlorger Agrich\nCalphad (English: Calph AD)\nGold foil manufacturing (English: goldbeating)\nGold phosphorus\nMetallurgical failure analysis (English: Metallurgical Failure Analysis)\nmining industry\nFire Method (English: Pyrometallurgy)\nReference [edit]\nQuote [edit]\n\n\n^ \"\u041c\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043b\u043b\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0438\u044f\" (page archive backup, existing internet archive).

Generally, the printing machine is typically published on the paper, which is the basic component of the publishing. The printing machine is a machine capable of printing on the substrate. Library is known as one of the four major inventions of ancient China, which can be said that the two great inventions of paper and printing have played a decisive role in the spread of human cultural knowledge.\nToday's books usually use offset printing technology to print, sometimes inversion printing (mainly for printing, but also less).\n\ntable of Contents\n\n1 printing history\n\n1.1 ancient typography\n1.2 dispute origin\n1.3 print real\n1.4 Printing Communication\n\n1.4.1 Korean Peninsula\n1.4.2 Japan\n1.4.3 Philippines\n1.4.4 West Asia\n1.4.5 Europe\n\n\n1.5 Industrial Times Printing\n\n\n2 Impact of printing on knowledge spread\n3 information age printing\n\n3.1 computer printing\n3.2 Other printing\n\n\n4 stereo printing\n5 3D print\n6 See\n7 References\n8 research book\n9 external link\n\n\nPrinting history [edit]\n 868 Tang Dynasty's Jindang Prajna\nAncient typography [edit]\nPrinting is the earliest to divert back to the two-river basin of the two river basins, which is used as a drum seal, which is mainly used as ornaments and witchcraft.\nThe sculpture printing is the first in China, which is gradually developed and synthesized by two methods of Tui and the seal. It is a long time, accumulated many people's experience, is a crystallization of human wisdom. The earliest literature and the earliest carving type are in the early days of the Tang Dynasty.\n\nIn the 7th century, a carved printing appeared in the early Tang Dynasty. Shen Kuo \"Mengxi Bread talks, skills\": \"Plate print book, Tang people have not been placed.\"\nSong Renzong Qing Dynasty (1041-1049), Bi Sheng invented the slurry letterpress printing.\n1241 to 1250 Yang Gu Dubei's murderer Yao Pu uses a literary version of the literary version of Zhu Xi \"Primary School\", \"Nearby\" and Lu Zuqian's \"History Collection\" and other books [1].\nYuan Dynasty scientist Wang Hao (1260-1330) invented wood lettering (also supporting there in the Song Dynasty), there were several versions to prove. One of them is often mentioned as Song Ben Live. \"Mao Poetry\". Because the book \"Tang Feng \u00b7 Mountain has a pivot\" in the \"self\" word horizontal, it can be proved to be a literary version.\nEarly records of China Metal Law, Yu Yu (1260-1330), in Yuan Dynasty, said in the \"Live Word Print Calligraphy\" (1298): \"The neighters of the world, cast tin, to the iron strips, work, embedded Inside the helmet, the borders, but the above words, it is difficult to make the ink, the rate is multi-print, so it will not take long time. \"\nThe Yuan Dynasty has two-color red and black-print books.\nDuring the Ming Dynasty, two-color, four-color printing print, which can printed multi-level color printing.\nJohannes Gittenburg (1397-1468) in Germany (1397-1468).\nIn the early 19th century, the improved lead alivem production technology and spread to all parts of the world.\nIn 1804, the British Charles Stanhp directed the literary version of the disadvantage, inventing mud lead printing printing.\nIn 1829, the French Ziera was inventing paper-type lead printing printing.\nIn 1855, the French M.CILLOT inventive phased copper zinc version printing technology. Further development of relief printing.\nIn 1871, American B.Blackwell improved paper-type lead printing, creating a thin lead version, padded in wooden bottom.\nIn 1882, German's Mei Dynasty, the MEISENDACH inventive, the printing of the printing, and the photo formation was forwarded forward.\nControversial origin [edit]\n The oldest metal letterpress printing this direct refers to the heart, 1377\n Yangzhou Carving Printing Museum\nThe earliest carving print in the world is China invented. At the end of the 19th century, there were Japanese scholars, and the Chinese six charters were printed in the 6th century. According to the \"Yan's home training\", the word \"\" is \"in the\" \u6cb3 \u6c7e \" In the thirteenth year of the Emperor, he was abandoned as a written sculpture version of the sculpture, and thought it was printed in the Sui Dynasty. [2]\nThe earliest print record\n\nZhang Xiumin, in the \"China Printing History\", started to Tang Yanguan, mainly based on the \"Hong Ji\" of Ming History, Shao Jingbang, Tang Taizong, the head of the grandchildren, \"women\" is about 10 Years (636) printing. The book also introduced Tang Fengqi \"Yunxian Duading\": Tang Xuanyu Yindshi Pudi (about 645 ~ 664) Show the Quartet for the Wave.\nDuring the Tang Dynasty (713-1714) The \"Kaiyuan Magnia\" is the world's earliest newspaper.\nTang Dynasty literature\n\n(Tang) Yijing \"South China Sea Famance Biography\": \"The sterling of the mud and the maintenance of the mud image, or the printing paper is supported everywhere.\"\n(Tang) Feng Wei \"Yunxian Surge\": \"Xuanzang takes the temptation of Mind Pu Xian to the four, and there is no bonus every year.\"\nThe mulade printing Buddha is a great relationship with Buddhism in the Tang Dynasty, and Buddhism has a great contribution to the improvement and inheritance of early printing in China, North Korea, Japan, and Buddhist technicians. [3] The scope of the printing is then expanded to other classics.\n\n(Song) Zhu Yi \"Musk Physical Notes\": \"Carving Text, Tang Dynasty, Tang Dynasty, Yizhou, ink, after the Tang Fang,\" Jiu Jing \".\nPrinting physical [edit]\nExisting printing products are:\n\nIn 1906, Xinjiang was unearthed from Xinjiang - 699 \"Magic Lotus\", currently Japan.\nIn 1966, the \"No Sculptive Greater Daloni\" found in the Buddha Temple, South Korea, is written in the Tang Dynasty, the Tang Dynasty, China. Korean scholars think this is from New Luo. Japanese scholar's Changze runture is a skeptical attitude of \"No Sculpt Greetry Daloni\", and the US student money in the United States. Zhang Xiumin, Chinese scholars believes that this is the Tang Dynasty Wu Zhoujun, flowing into New Luo. Recent studies have shown that \"no screaks of the large Daloni\" in the first year of Tangwu Zhou Changan (701) completed Luoyang Fan Temple, the second year was in Chang'an, and 703 were born into Xinluo [4].\nJapan Nara Fayon Temple \"Million Taroroni\", printed in Japan for about 770.\nDunhuang discovered \"Diamond\", printing in 868, fine carvings, far from the previous Dost.\nChinese traditional Chinese paintings have also retapleded with wood-based Chinese painting, such as the famous Yangliu youth painting.\nSince the printing of the engraving printing can only be used for specific prints, the platelet has a large workload, and the efficiency is low, making early prints very precious. In order to solve the problem of the plate, the orthodontics are later invented. Since the alignment in the group version can be reused, the overall efficiency of printing is greatly improved. Early alignment uses cement production, modern times are improved to use lead words.\nLaboratory printing is a Bi Song in 1040, China. The \"Mengxi Net Talk\", which was called Shen Kuo, was described in the time of the famous scientist, and completely non-suggestions included a complete set of orthodontics and printing and printing, and the principle of the prototype plate version of the later generation was identical. Bi Sheng invented the slurry word printing was carefully designed, and the repeated test was successful. Early active word printing is found to find and confirm the authenticity and scientificity of Bi Si's orthodontics.\nMetal alignment printing is also invented in the Northern Song Dynasty. In the 12th century and 13th century, the orthodontics spread in Asia, there are many libraries in Arabic and Chinese, including tens of thousands of books. Metalism is invented by the Song Dynasty.\n\nWang Hao (1260-1330) in the Yuan Dynasty, in \"Activory Word Printing Calligraphy\" (1298): \"The neighters also cast tin, according to iron strips, work, embedded in the helmet, However, the above words, it is difficult to make the ink, the rate is multi-print, so it is not a long time. \"This is China's early record on the metal letter. The neighbors said by the beginning of Yuan, of course, the Song Dynasty, indicating that the use of the Tin live word is in the Song Dynasty. It is a major reform of a printing material and a letter from a non-metallic active word to a metal.\nQing Hushu Jia Sun Congtian (1769-1840) is in the \"Collection of Books\" (1810): \"Song is engraved with copper character, live word\". It is clear that there is copper living by copper living in the Song Dynasty.\nPrinting dissemination [edit]\nKorean Peninsula [edit]\nJapan [edit]\nIn the 754, the Tang Dynasty, the Tang Dynasty, the Tang Dynasty, Japan, presided over the three Buddhist scriptures, and passed the printing into Japan.\nJapan Nara Dynasty \"Million Taroni\" is engraved with the \"no-scale net light Greetry\" found in Qingzhou, South Korea, is the same as China Tang Wu Zhou Luoyang, may be the Japanese monk twice to come back to Japan. [5].\nIn 1592, Japan invaded North Korea failed, brought back tens of thousands of copper living words, and published \"Ancient Wen Xiaojing\" in 1593. In 1607, the river has also been published in Kyoto, and the 61 volume of the \"Ben Chen Note\" is selected. In 1615, Lin Luoshan planted copper live book \"Da Tibet\" 125, 1616, also billed the copper living standard group of 60. Live characters from North Korea to 10,000 words in the Han Dynasty officials of Japan [6].\nIn 1637, Japan, Tianhai, Tianhai, the name of General Techu, the name of Mikawa, presided over, is engraved with wood, \"all pass\" 1453, 6323, \"[6].\nPhilippines [edit]\nIn the 1593, the Philippines appeared in the Philippines, the earliest in the Philippines is a Chineseian Johanvila. He created the first printing plant in the Philippines; the first Chinese Christianity in the Philippines is his publishing. The original book has lost, existing 1606 Chinese wooden engraving \"orthopedic\" [7].\nWest Asia [edit]\n Egyptian carving version of the Egyptian carving Qur'an 10x10 cm\nChina's Yuan Dynasty, China and Europe have a great development. First, the expedition of Mongolia, bringing China's culture to the West, and the Western missionary soil has also come to China many times, and also brought China's printing technology. In the 13th century, the Italian Human Bo Polo has been in China for many years. In his \"travel\", the situation of China's printing banknotes is described. His introduction makes Europeans know China's printing. It is said that in this period, some people also brought China's prints and carving to Europe. China's printing is most likely to pass through the Uighurs through the Silk Road into Central Asia, spread through the Arab world to Europe. The world's earliest active alphabetic version of the world is currently discovered is the 14th century ancient dimox of the 14th century in Dunhuang.\nIn 1880, an archaeologist found more than 50 carved prints from 900 to 1350 in Egyptian Fa, including praying and Qur'an, and these prints were printed on paper, and the printed is like China. Printing, is not imprint. The academic community generally believes that Egyptian carving printing comes from China, not the livestock of the earth [8] [9].\nIn 1294, the Mongolian Kajia Tu Khan, who was ruling in Persian, was printed in the big hairy, and it was printed with Chinese \"banknotes\" word [10].\nIn the 1310, Persi historian Lished Ding Ding Ding Ding Detained in the book of \"World History\", in detail, China's carving printing [11] [12].\nAlthough printing has been introduced to the Arab world, it is blocked by religion, especially in 1727, Islamic leaders announced that the printed Guran has violates Izlan, which is prohibited, so that printing is not developed in the Arab world [13]. In 1707, there was a Hungarian named Ilahim, approved to Turkey to establish a printing office in Constantine, at that time, although the Sudanese Haymot III was approved, but the Qur'an can only be copied, it is not allowed to print, 1729 In the year, a history of Egypt was published, causing a strong opposition. In 1825, there was no more printing attempt all over the Arab. However, in the 15th century, there are also Arabic Wenlan in Italy, but the 16th century Syria also still exists in Arabic printing. In 1797, the Russian Catherine was still printed in Russia with a carving of Quran [14].\n\nEurope [edit]\n Turpan found 1400\nAs in Europe, like China, the first thing is the carving printing, and there is a library printing. Europeans discovered that China's orthographic printing is higher than that of the engraving printing efficiency is so fast, and the carving is eliminated. About China's printing is passed to Europe, there are three in many books. One is the European missionary and travelers directly bring China's printing to Europe; the other is passed through Central Asia, West Asia, North Africa, and finally passed to Europe; Article 3 is passed by the Russians to other European countries.\nInvention of the Chinese Song Dynasty's cards in the 194th centuries in the early 14th century, in the early 14th century, playing cards in Spain and Germany, play cards in Italy and Belgium, 1381 France, play cards [15] [16].\n\nThe German believes that the Johannes Gitanburg, the United States invented the printing technology in 1440, which has been improved from the vintage press, and the role of Turntao developed the use of raised alignment, using oily ink from the beginning. However, the research scholars have been conclusively after a large number of research and adoption, the source of orthodontics is China, and Hangao Annta Pagang has taken \"Representative of European Centralism: The so-called Turntao may be printed inventors\" That is the title of the title [17].\n\nIndustrial age printing [edit]\nThe invention of the printing machine will bring printing techniques into the mechanical phase from the manual phase.\n\nInfluence of printing on knowledge spread [edit]\nThe development of printing machines has made knowledge of revolutionary changes: the first printing community (ie publisher) in Venice (ie, publishing house) in Venice, 417 printing plants in 1500. In 1476, William Kakston was established in England in England in 1539, Spanish Juan Pablos in Mexico City, Mexico. Stephen Day in 1628 in the United States, Massan Bay The area has established the first printing agency in North America, and assists in the establishment of Cambridge Publishing House.\n\nInformation age printing [edit]\nDuring the rapid development of electronic technology, printing entered the e-control and automation, electronic typography, electronic color separation, electronic engraving wide application, has been greatly improved in printing quality and efficiency. Computer applications continue to bring printing into digital printing ages, making small varieties that are difficult to complete, and multi-change printing is successful.\n\nComputer printing [edit]\nMain entry: printer\nDocuments can be printed by laser printers, inkjet printers, or other computer printers. In recent years, computer printing and industrial printing processes have been integrated together, leading to the development of digital printing.\n\nOther printing [edit]\nThe drawing process of the prints is also commonly referred to as printing, and the photocopy is also one of printing.\n\nStereo printing [edit]\nStereoscopic printing (English: lenticular printing), 3D lens printing is also a printing effect, and the optical refraction is lifelike stereo effect, and the object is a conventional printing (hierarchical design) and grating material. In 2008, a company, such as a macro-professional printing, proposed a three-dimensional print solution.\n\n3D printing [edit]\nThree-dimensional print is a manufacturing technology, and the object is generated by three-dimensional files and three-dimensional printers. The object manufacturing is printed by superposition of a layer of layer. In 2012, some companies such as Sculpteo or Shapeway proposed a three-dimensional print solution on the Internet.\n\nSee [edit]\n\n\nmethod\nTypography\noffset printing\nColor printing\nGravure printing\nToppan Printing\nLithographic printing\nPaper print\nNo version of printing\nEngraving print\nKong version printing\nFlexographic printing\nPhotographing\nAnti-counterfeiting printing\nSpecial printing\n\ncharacter\nBi\nWang Yu\nADAM D'Ambergau\nDavid Bruce\nWilliam Clows\nGeorge E.

For the practical application of this entry research, please see \"Chemical Industry\".\n Chemical factory\nChemical engineering, referred to as chemical, is the general principle of chemical processes and physical processes in the production process of chemical industry (such as petroleum refining, plastic, metallurgy, food, printing and dyeing industry, paint and chlor-alkali industries) And regular, and use these laws to address engineering and technical disciplines for process and equipment development, design, operation and improvement. It mainly studies large-scale chemical composition and its mechanical and physical properties. Simply define the essence of chemical engineering, it is based on mathematics and a small amount of physical concepts in chemical industries, providing a factory for producing various chemicals or materials. It provides a most cost-effective response process design. Experimental research, theoretical analysis and scientific calculation have become an indispensable three main means of contemporary chemical research.\n\ntable of Contents\n\n1 summary\n2 history\n\n2.1 evolution\n2.2 Recent development\n\n\n3 basic concept\n\n3.1 Chemical Reaction Engineering\n3.2 Programming\n3.3 Transfer phenomenon\n\n\n4 application\n5 becomes a chemical engineer\n6 research field\n7 related entries\n8 reference\n9 reference books\n\n\nOverview [edit]\nThe theoretical basis of chemical engineering is mainly chemical, mathematics and physics. Including the branches of the above disciplines, such as:\n\nThermodynamics\nChemical kinetics\nHistory [edit]\n Students in the Industrial Laboratory of Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nChemical engineering is based on its most basic concept-unit operation. Most people think George Davis invented this discipline in units, but did not actively develop it [1]. In 1887, he was considered an early pioneer of chemical engineering in the University of Manchester, England, is considered to be the early pioneer of chemical engineering [2]. As early as Davis opened this lesson, Henry Edward Armstrong has opened a degree program in the London City Research Institute; however, most employers prefer employ chemists or mechanical engineers. The foreground of the graduates of the course is not optimistic, so failed to return [3]. The relevant courses in the University of Massachusetts, England, and the relevant courses carried out in the University of London have also faced similar situations [4].\nLouis Norton has been awarded the first chemical program in the United States in the MIT in 1888 [5]. Norton's courses are all similar to each other, all of which are all similar to each other, all of which have been combined with chemical and engineering. At that time, the initial chemical engineers engaged in the Bank faced the identity problem. They one side like engineers, and on the other hand, it is not only a general chemist [3]. In 1905, William Walker introduced the theory of unit operations in their own curriculum [6]. In the 1920s, the unit operation has become an important part of chemical engineering in the aforementioned school and college [7]. The American Chemical Engineering Society established in 1908 (AICHE) is an important role in which chemical engineering has become an independent science. In addition, under its establishment and promotion, unit operations become the focus of chemical engineering [8]. At the same time, the Chemical Engineering Association (ICHEME) established in 1922 has established chemical engineering as an independent discipline [9] [10].\n\nEvolution [edit]\nIn the 1940s, only the unit operation is not enough to cope with the development of chemical reactors; however, units are still in an advantage in the chemical curriculum of the United Kingdom and the US colleges. Until the 1960s, the delivery phenomenon began to receive a large attention [11]. Transfer phenomenon provides a systematic analysis of chemical engineering [12]. The development of chemical industry before and after the Second World War is mainly led by the Petrochemical Industry, but other fields have also developed [13]. In the 1940s, the biochemical engineering and pharmaceutical projects have begun, technology is sufficient to produce hypertrophy, streptomycin, etc. [14]. At the same time, the development of polymer science in the 1950s promoted the rise of later plastic industries [15].\n\nRecent development [edit]\nWith the rapid development of computer science, it greatly simplifies the complex process of manual calculation and hand drawn. The completion of the human genome program is not only the progress of chemical engineering, but also is considered a major development of genomics and genetic engineering [16]. The principle of chemical work is also used in a large number of nucleic acid sequences [17].\n\nBasic concept [edit]\nchemical engineering\nsummary\nhistory\nIndex (English: History of Chemical Engineering)\nbasis\nchemical industry\nchemical engineer\nChemical process\nUnit operation\nChemical kinetics\nTransportation phenomenon\n\nUnit process\nChemical factory\nChemical reactor\nSeparation process\n\nResearch areas\nHeat transfer\nQuality\nFluid mechanics\nprogramming\nProgram control\nChemical thermodynamics\nChemical Reaction Engineering\n\n Main classification check\nThe following concepts often use in chemical engineering:\n\nChemical reaction engineering [edit]\nMain entry: chemical reaction project\nThe chemical engineering field contains control factory procedures and conditions to ensure the best operation of the factory. The chemical reaction engineer uses laboratory data and chemical thermodynamic physical parameters to construct an analysis model or design reactor, and thereby solve problems and predict the performance of reactors. [18]\n\nProgram design [edit]\nMain entry: programming (chemical)\nUnit operation is a physical step in the chemical engineering program, such as crystallization, filtration, drying, and evaporation. These units are combined to operate, and the reaction is prepared, purified and separated, recover the remaining reactants and the energy conveyance in the reactor [19]. On the other hand, the process of one unit and unit operation are chemically equivalent; with a unit operation, several unit processes constitute an overall processing process. Unit process, such as nitriding or oxidation, etc., involving a large number of biochemical, thermochemical transformation methods. Engineers responsible for these are called \"program engineers\" [20].\n\nTransfer phenomenon [edit]\nMain entry: transport phenomenon\nThe use of delivery phenomena is very common on the industrial line, including fluid mechanics, heat delivery, and mass delivery, etc., further involves moving transport, energy conveying and chemical delivery, and the like. When the promotion of three different levels of different levels of expressions, micro and molecules, etc., the basic equation used is very similar; therefore, when learning and transporting, there is a comprehensive and multi-multimsychochron. [twenty one]\n\nApplication [edit]\n Chemical engineers control and monitor automation plant systems with computers. [twenty two]\nThe chemical engineer specializes in finding and constructing the most affordable production methods, and its consolidation has a focus on cost issues such as raw materials and energy [23]. Chemical engineers use chemical and engineering knowledge to convert unprocessed low-cost materials into high-cost useful products such as drugs, petrochemical products, and plastic. They also focus on pollutant emissions and research. There is a large number of computers to assist in applications and research [22].\nChemical engineers may engage in industrial production or academic research; they specialize in design or experiments to find and establish more excellent production methods, pollution control, saving resources, and safety. They may be specially designed and constructed factory project engineers. In the field of chemical industry, engineers use their expertise to choose factory equipment, control the maximum production and cost of production production and cost, and is engaged in the upgrade and maintenance of future continuation factories. [24] The chemical engineer may be employed by the management plant in a lifetime; via, it is also possible to become a professional consultant, handling and assisting chemical related issues.\n\nBecome a chemical engineer [edit]\nUsually at least university degree, there is a relevant license to have a different degree effect, such as chemical B, Chemical B, C, C, Chemical prophet, etc.\n\nResearch field [edit]\nToday, chemical engineering research is very diversified, covering many fields such as traditional chemical industries, materials science, biotechnology, and NiM technology.\n\n\n\n\nBiochemical engineering\nBiological program engineering\nBioxult\nbiomedical engineering\nBiomolecular engineering\nBiotechnology\nBiotechnology engineering\ncatalytic\nceramics\nChemical process modeling\nChemical technology expert\nChemical reactor\nChemical weapon\nChemical Information\nComputational Fluid Dynamics\nAnti-corrosion project\nCost Estimate\nElectrochemical\nEnvironmental Engineering\nSeismic engineering\nFischer\n\n\n\nThermodynamics\nTransportation phenomenon\nUnit operation\nFluid mechanics\nFood engineering\nThe fuel cell\ngasification\nheat transfer\nIndustrial Gases\nIndustrial catalyst\nMass transfer\nmaterial science\nMetallurgy\nHouse\nMolecular engineering\nNami Science\nNatural environment\nNatural gas processing\nNuclear fuel processes\nDrilling\nRefining\n\n\n\nPharmaceutical engineering\nPlastic engineering\nPolymer, plastic\nProgram control\nprogramming\nProcess simulation\nProgram engineering\nMinimize procedures\nPapermaking engineering\nSafety Engineering\nSemiconductor device manufacturing\nSeparation process\nCrystallization process\nDistillation process\nMembrane Technology\nSyngas production\nTextile industry\nWater treatment\npaint\nDye, bleaching\n\n\nRelated entries [edit]\n\n\nChemical theme\nEngineering theme\nChemical engineer list\nChemical Engineering List List\nChemical process simulator list\nReference [edit]\n\n\n^ Cohen 1996, PP. 172-173.\n\n^ Cohen 1996, P. 175.\n\n^ 3.0 3.1 Reynolds 2001, p. 176.\n\n^ Cohen 1996, P. 178.\n\n^ Cohen 1996, P. 180.\n\n^ Cohen 1996, P. 183.\n\n^ Cohen 1996, P. 184.\n\n^ Cohen 1996, P. 187.\n\n^ Cohen 1996, P. 189.\n\n^ Cohen 1996, P. 190.\n\n^ Cohen 1996, P. 185.\n\n^ Perkins 2003, P. 30.\n\n^ Reynolds 2001, p. 177.\n\n^ Perkins 2003, PP. 32-33.\n\n^ Kim 2002, P. 7s.\n\n^ Kim 2002, P. 9s.\n\n^ American Institute of Chemical Engineers 2003A.\n\n^ Carberry 2001, PP. 1-2.\n\n^ McCabe, Smith & Hariott 1993, P. 4.\n\n^ SILLA 2003, PP. 8-9.\n\n^ Bird, Stewart & Lightfoot 2002, PP. 1-2.\n\n^ 22.0 22.1 Garner 2003, PP. 47-48.\n\n^ American Institute of Chemical Engineers 2003, Article III.\n\n^ Garner 2003, PP. 49-50.\n\n\nReference book [edit]\n.mw-parser-output .refbegin {font-size: 90%; margin-bottom: 0.5em} .mw-parser-output .refbegin-henging-indeents> ul {list-style-type: none; margin-left: 0} .mw-parser-output .refbegin-henging-indents> ul> li, .mw-parser-output .refbegin-henging-indeft: 0; padding-left: 3.2em; Text -indent: -3.2em; list-style: none} .mw-paser-output .refbegin-100 {font-size: 100%}\nAmerican Institute of Chemical Engineers, AICHE CONSTIN, 2003-01-17 [2011-08-13], (original content archived on 2011-08-13).\nBird, R.

Previous communication technology and information technology are two completely different categories: communication technology focuses on transmission technology of message communication, and information technology focuses on encoding or decoding of information, and the transmission of communication carriers. With the development of technology, these two techniques slowly become unparalleled, thus gradually integrated into a category.\nInformation technology is mainly used to manage and process all kinds of technical generals adopted by information. It is mainly to apply computer science and communication technology to design, develop, install and implement information systems and application software.\nCommunication technology mainly includes transmission access, network exchange, mobile communication, wireless communication, optical communication, satellite communication, support management, private network communication, etc. Now popular technology has 5G, LTE, IPTV, VoIP, NGN, and IMS.\nInformation and Communication Technology (Information and Communication Technology) is one of the new high school education in Hong Kong, predecessor

comprehensive utilization of mathematics, physics, chemistry, biological knowledge, and engineering itself, to address various issues such as biology and pharmaceutics. Means have an engineering that needs to be needed in biological products. It uses, but is not limited to, molecular biology, biochemistry, microbiology, pharmacology, protein chemistry, cytology, immunology, neuroscopics, etc., and the partial and even overall life of artificial reproduction of organisms. Finally achieve the expected role of producing biological products or medical care. As a study, biological engineering also includes biomedical engineering and related biotechnology. Biological system engineering is also a category of biological engineering. This discipline has improved the biological system through the design, sustainable development and analysis of finished products.\nUnder normal circumstances, attempts of the biological engineer (or biologist) are in the form of a product or modification and control biological system that mimic biomarre creation so that they can be replaced, increased, maintained, or predict chemical and mechanical processes. [1] Biological engineers can use other application projects and biotechnology of their expertise, including gene-modified plants and microorganisms, bioengineering and biocatalysis. Work and doctors, clinicians and researchers, biologists use traditional engineering principles And technology, and use them in real-world biological and medical issues [2].\n\ntable of Contents\n\n1 classification\n2 history\n3 ginseng\n4 Reference\n\n\nClassification [edit]\nAt present, the hotspots of biological engineering can be generally divided into the following three categories in terms of different main purposes:\n\nBiological Process Engineering (English: Bioprocess Engineering), including:\nBioprocess Design\nBiocurification chemistry (biocatalytic)\nBioseparation\nBiological information\nGenetic engineering, including:\nSynthetic biology\nCell Engineering\nOrganize engineering\nGene level transfer\nHeterologous biology\nBiomedical engineering, including:\nBiomedical technology (English: Biomedical Technology)\nBiomedical Diagnosis\nBiomedical Tharapy\nbiology\nBiological material (English: biomaterials)\nHistory [edit]\nOn the eve of the Second World War, the bioengineering has just begun to be a separate engineering branch, a new concept. After World War II, it began to develop rapidly, which is the basic reason for the term \"bioengineering\" being created. At that time, the frontier researchers of the Bioengineering were the British Scientist Heinz * Wolf, and he was in the National Institute in 1954. The electrical engineering was considered to be an engineering branch produced by medical equipment. But in subsequent period [3], when engineers and life scientists start working together, they realize that there is a new and independent discipline to solve the problem of biological product production. To solve these problems, they hope that the biologists and pharmacists have invested more time and research details and procedures into the field, such as biology, psychology and medicine [4]. Later biological engineering can also be applied The environment is modified, such as surface soil protection, stabilization of slopes, water and coastal protection, wind surrender, vegetation barrier (such as three-north protective forest), including noise barrier and view barrier. Because other engineering areas also handle living organisms, bioengineering can also apply more broadly including agricultural engineering and environmental engineering.\n\nSee [edit]\nAgricultural engineering\nBiotechnology\nCloning technology\nStem cell technology\nnanotechnology\nReference [edit]\n\n\n... ^ Pasotti, Lorenzo; Zucca, Susanna Advances and Computational Tools towards Predictable Design in Biological Engineering Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine 2014-08-03, 2014: 369681.

social management and protection, demographics, economics, political, and ethics. science. Environmental Science includes disciplines affecting human and other organisms. Nature and human resources are interdependent, and any of the actions, correct or errors made by one party will affect the other side. This discipline was shorter until the 1960s became a formal discipline. In 1960, Rachael Carson has a midburns of ecological book \"Silent Spring\", which makes the theme of the environment becomes hotspots, just like 1969 in the Well-spray oil accident in St. Barbara beach in California, California, and the same year in Ohio. The Kayoa River in Cleveland, which enables the public to rise to the environmental movement, thereby creating the new discipline of the environment. Environmental Sciences until 1960 and 1970, the main reasons extensively active from scientific research are:\n\nA group of powerful diversity is needed to analyze complex environmental issues.\nEstablish a series of environmental protection, requires precise environmental research draft.\nThe people have gradually realized all kinds of problems in life, and everyone needs a solution to environmental issues.\nDefinition of Environmental Science: One study of interaction between human social development activities and environmental evolution laws, seeking science of human society and environmental synergy, sustainable development pathways and methods.\nIn macro, environmental science should study the interaction between people and the environment, to conflue with each other, and strive to discover the law between social and economic development and environmental protection; in micro, it is necessary to study the substance in the environment in organic body The process of migration, transformation, accumulation, and its motion law, the impact of life, and the mechanism of action, especially the pollutants discharged from human activities.\nEnvironmental Sciences should explore environmental evolution laws in the world; the relationship between human activities and natural ecology; environmental changes affect human survival; and regional environmental pollution control technology and management measures.\n\ntable of Contents\n\n1 subject composition\n2 research content\n3 Provisions for promoting research\n4 work of environmental scientists\n5 subject branch\n6 reference\n\n\nSubject composition [edit]\nAtmospheric science mainly studies the atmosphere of the Earth, especially the interrelationship between it and other systems. Atmospheric science includes gas diffusion patterns related to meteorology, greenhouse gas, air pollutants [1] [2], and the sound phenomenon related to noise pollution, and even photolorestation.\nTaking global warming as an example, the physicist established a computer model of atmospheric circulation and infrared wireless transmission, and chemists have studied chemicals and chemical reactions in the atmosphere. The biologists analyze the changes of carbon dioxide in animals. Active role, some experts such as meteorologists and marineologists deepen their understanding of atmospheric motivation.\n\n Biodiversity of coral reefs. Coral formation of calcium carbonate skeleton adapts and changing the environment they are in. This provides growth conditions for future generations, and has a habitat for many other species.\nEarth science includes environmental geology, soil environmental science (English: Environmental soil science), volcanic phenomenon and crustal evolution. Environmental science in some classification systems also includes hydrazine (including oceanics).\nCareful analysis of the cause of the surface runoff by soil scientists as a research example of soil erosion. River biologists assisted in studying the loss of sedimentation of continental water. The physicist will contribute to the change of the transmission of the water transmitted by assessing the transmission of water. Biologists will analyze the follow-up effects of water plants and animals as water.\nEnvironmental Chemistry is a chemical research branch of environmental science, and its theoretical research sector includes soil pollution and water pollution. Analysis Themes include degradation of chemicals in the soil, migration in different stages, for example, after the solvent is evaporated, the solvent diffuses in air, which will become air pollutants. In addition, chemicals also affect bioqual.\nFor example, a leakage chemical solvent tank falls into a soil that is inhabitially inhabitially perched on an endangered amphibious animal. If you want to obtain the degree of pollution of this soil and the distribution of the solvent in the soil, a computer model method can be used. The chemist can describe the molecular structure of the chemical solvent according to the measured soil type, and biologists can investigate the effects of chemical solvents to other organisms, including soil arthrics, plants, and pond creatures as such endangered amphibians.\nEcology refers to the analysis of environmental science knowledge in related fields, and the ecosystem is not affected by not only a stress. For example, water pollution and air pollution caused by highly respected industrial development will affect certain species of the seaport, and ecology can be used to detect these changes. According to this study, biologists will be able to describe the animal and plant groups in detail.

Most local regulations agree with these instructions, these instructions apply to local activities. The result is a significant increase in the study of literature and environmental influence prior to operation.\nTo read the environmental impact assessment cases listed in the National Environmental Policy Law, we can verify the specific content of the environmental science. For example, after the wastewater treatment is upgraded, choose to discharge to San Diego or refurbishment, San Francisco International Airport, Houston underground transportation system Development, the upgrades of the Metro Boston Transportation Police Bureau transportation system and 66 intercontinental buildings through Virginia Arlington Cemetery.\nEngland and Wales' Environmental Protection Agency [3] (with the predecessor of the agent) were established in 1996, which belongs to public agencies that protect and improve the environment, and put regulations in local communities and government websites [4].\nAccording to the 1995 Environmental Protection, the Environmental Protection Agency was founded as an independent institution, and cooperated with the British government to implement environmental protection regulations.\n\nEnvironmental scientists' work [edit]\nScience series entry\nForm science\nlogic\nmathematics\n\nMathematical logic\nMathematical statistics\nTheoretical Computer Science\ngame theory\n\nPhysics science\nphysics\n\nClassic physics\nModern physics\nApplied physics\n\nTheoretical physics\nExperimental physics\n\nCalculate physics\n\nAtomic physics\nCondensed physics\n\nMechanics.

Social life is the general name of daily life, urban life, political life, cultural life, artistic life, and religious life. Social life is a whole, all walks of life, is indispensable for society. Any occupation is related to the development of society, and there is existence value and significance.  Different people have different opinions on life, depending on personal thoughts, hobbies, etc.  Historians Lu Si believe that life is in the world, in addition to the universal generation, there is always a volunteer. [1]: 135 Volunteers, is successful, happy. [1]: 135 volunteers can't do it, seems to fail, but your heart is exhausted, but also don't worry, it is happiness. [1]: 135 Volunteers are different, it seems difficult to compare. [1]: 135 However, its character is bigger, and its volunteer is more, the more it is more, and it is a less intensive, it is certainly too unwaver. [1]: 135 Which of the world's volunteers are only for themselves; say that he is a small person, so he is a little bit. [1]: 135 Art (Latin: ARS; French, English: Art; Spanish, Portuguese: Arte; German: kunst) refers to the integration and balance of integrated people with skills, will, imagination, experience, etc., to create an aesthetic The expression model of the instrument, environment, image, action or sound, also refers to the process of sharing beauty with others or humans with deep emotions and consciousness to express existing perceived and personal or group experience precipitation and display. [1].\n\nAll human culture has some form of art and music, and art expression is one of the universal cultural generals.\n\nArt Traditionally include the following types: literary art (including poetry, drama, novel, etc.), visual art (painting, sketch, sculpture, etc.), graphic design, modeling art (such as sculpture, style), decorative art (such as mosaic map Design, etc.) [2], performance art (drama, dance, advertising [3], music, etc.) [1].\n\nIn the 17th century to the 18th century in Europe, art and science entered the critical period of knowledge and mutual inspiration, this process promoted the art and scientific finished products into an important symbol of Western humanistic thinking and civilization. [4]. The encyclopedia of the European Enlightenment Sports is also a dictionary titled book with the new state of the human groups that have been raised by art and science [5] [6] [7] [8].\n\nFrench and English ART (art) one word from the ancient Greek Latin ARS, the righteousness is \"skill\" [9], although the original meaning is also derived, almost all of the close-related life is closely related. Creative learning.\n\nThe word \"in Chinese came from the\" Han Han Shu \"Wenyuan Biography, Liu Zhen has mentioned\" Calibration Dongguan 5th, Zhuzi, Baijiao \", but the art refers to Six Arts and Structure, etc. The general name of the skills, and the meaning of modern art [10].\n\nIn terms of literature, literature, painting, music, dance, sculpture, architecture, drama, and movies, the knowledge in these areas is sufficient to establish a corresponding learning. In addition, some emerging art sectors such as design, photography, video games (video games (video games), and experimental art are also gradually received by the academic and public, and many art colleges have opened relevant profession [11 ].\n\n\nIn Chinese and English, the names of art and art often have mixed situations, strictly speaking, art corresponds to English, is a broad and wide concept, and the art corresponds to the English, which is a narrow, just the expression of art. One. Art includes \"painting\", \"sculpture\", \"building\", \"literature\", \"music\", \"drama\", \"dance\", \"movie\" and even \"game\", and \"art\" generally refers to \" Painting, \"Sculpture\" as the core of visual art. However, in the daily term, art and art are often equal to the equal sign. In the education sector, there have been controversy, causing the confusion of students related artists.\n\n\nSince the 20th century, it has been constantly emerged in conventional forms of elements other than traditional definition art, such as common \"Technical Art),\" Digital Art \",\" Installation Art \"(Installation ART) , \"Conceptual ART\", \"Behavioral Art\", \"Biological Art\", etc. Such a variety of art forms continue to challenge the limit of the artistic theory. Regarding how art is recognized, it has become an open problem, and it is currently based on the current recognition of art world.\n\nThere are many different functions in history, so it is difficult to abstract the purpose of art into a single concept. This does not mean that the purpose of art is to vague, but there are many different art creations, unique reasons. The purpose of an art will be listed below, which is divided into two types (Motivated).\n\nThe art of no motor means those art that is an indispensable part of human beings. This type of art beyond individual, or is not created for a particular purpose. With this point of view, art and creativity, it is human, and therefore exceeds the practical level.\n\nArtificial art refers to those that are generated by specific purposes. It may be to politically change, express a subject of society, express specific feelings or aimed at attitude, statement of personal psychology, describing another thing, selling products, or as an exchange of tools.\n\nSo far, there is no recognized art classification standard. The factions of each artistic theory have different classification, the more comparable and controversial in the timeline.\n\nIn general, the art can be divided into accordance with the different manifestations and methods.\n\nCompare new branching, the art is divided into:\n\nThe following is a common art category\n\n[Edit in Wiki Data] Culture (Japanese: Culture / \u3076 \u304b \u304b \u304b \u304b) is the first use of the ancient Roman philosopher Sichylo first using Latin \"Cultura Animi\" definition, the original interest is \"the cultivation of the soul\", which is derived as a biology to accumulate Self-living-related knowledge or experiences make it adapt to natural or surrounding environments, and is a group of foreign performances that work together in the same natural environment and economic production methods.\n\nThere are a variety of definitions for \"culture\", one of which is to achieve perfection through the essence of learning human thoughts and behaviors; [1] Generalized culture includes text, language, architecture, diet, tools, skills , Technology, knowledge, custom, art, etc. [2]. It can be used in the form of a nation to allege a culture [3].\n\nIn archeology, \"culture\" refers to the remains of the same historical period, the complex of the relics. The same tool, utensil, manufacturing technology, etc. are characteristics of the same culture. Cultural and civilization sometimes confused in the use of law.\n\nNowadays, the meaning of Chinese culture is, borrowed from Japanese and Chinese \"culture\", the concept of expression, the collection and meaning of the integration and the original difference of Huaxia ancient books should be avoided.\n\nMature development of Internet networks makes the original relatively alienated individual or organization can easily via the community website, build many new values, ideals, ideas, business, friendship, blood, etc. very intricate, thereby developing specific Network culture of community awareness, this network culture contact instant explosion force, the impact of the specific issues and elections is already the power of emerging cannot be ignored. [4]\n\n\"Zhou Yi, a resignation\": \"There is a miscellaneous, so \u6587.\"\n\u5f56 \u66f0:, ...... just soft, astronomy; civilization, humanities. Watching astronomy, in case of time; watching humanities, to become a world.\nAmong them, human culture, can be abbreviated as \"culture\".\n\nCulture is actually a referusion of \"humanism\" in Chinese. The premise is that \"people\" are cultural, and it is a special language to discuss human society; \"Wen\" is the foundation and tool, including language and / or text; \"Teacher\" is the true center of gravity of this word: as a noun \"Teaching\" is a common norm of people's spiritual activities and material activities (and also reflected in this norm in spiritual activities of spiritual activities and substances), as the \"teaching\" of the verb is a joint norm, inheritance, transmission and recognition Process and means.\n\nTraditional China has Huayi, but there is no Culture concept, and there is no difference between Chinese culture, foreign cultures, and the translation of the culture is the Japanese.\n\nThis word in the Latin system originated in the first time of the ancient Roman philosopher Sichylo in the \"Tuscoo debate\". At that time, he refered is the soul of the soul or \"Cultura Animi\" [6], Come to metaphorism The development of the so-called soul is the highest realm of human development. Samuel Pufen Doff transformed this metaphor to the \"culture\" of modernization, but he didn't think philosophy is the natural perfectness of human beings. In contrast, he believes that culture is \"to make human beings from the wild, and become a full person\" [7].\n\nTherefore, the meaning of culture not only cultivates the land, but also refers to the practice of the land, raising animals; care for people's lives, such as dressing, decorating the body, care and care for friends and sacrifices; also means living in urban or urban, and cultivating Correct moral and mental, etc. In the late Middle Age, culture begins to refer to morality and mind, and artistic achievements [5].\n\nCulture actually includes three aspects of the instrument (material culture), system (system culture) and concept (spiritual culture), including language, text, custom, thought, national strength, etc., objectively, cultural, is the sum of social value systems.\n\nThere is a different statement on the composition of cultural, the most common is the \"three-level saying\" of material culture, institutional culture and spiritual culture [5].\n\nCultural and civilization sometimes confused in the use. So some scholars have filed distinction, civilization, and the performance of politics, law, economy, education, etc., as well as the results of technology and science, can be considered to be civilized. As for the culture of culture, it is highly regarded in the spirit, including religion, philosophy, art and other ideas and customs [3].\n\nAs early as the primitive social period, human beings have formed the first division of labor, producing agricultural nations and animal husbandons. Animal husbandry should live in water grass, and they are unsettled, and it is not easy to produce large-scale gatherings. There is no urgent need for text. The life of the agricultural nation is contained in the nomad, not only a fixed residence, but also a fixed person to survive the source of food. This way of lifestyle is not only easy to form larger, but also provides soil for the generation of \"early civilization\". The emergence of text symbols caused the second division of labor to form brain labor and physical labor, and made a good foundation for the development of \"medium-term civilization\". The shape of the text marks the beginning of the original social period, the beginning of the feudal society.\n\nDifferent disciplines have different understandings of culture.\n\nFrom the perspective of philosophy, culture is believed to be in essentially a philosophical idea. Due to the era and regionality of philosophy, the cultural style is determined. In general, the changes in philosophical ideas have caused changes in social system, with the rise of the suppression and new culture of old culture.\n\nFrom the perspective of existism, culture is a description of the presence of a person or a group of people. People exist in nature, but also in history and era; time is an important platform that exists in nature; society, national and national (family) is a person or a group of people exist in history and era. Another important platform; cultural refers to people in this process or statement, interaction or behavioral way, awareness or cognitive method. Culture is not only used to describe a group of people's external behavior, and cultural special includes self-cultural awareness and perceptual way for people of individuals. A person who returns a self-dialogue that returns to their hearts, observe the way.\n\nThe functionalism believes that the cultural includes two aspects of matter and spirit, whether specific substances, such as cane, tools, vessels, or abstract social phenomena, such as custom habits, ideology, social system, etc., have satisfied humanity The role of actual life needs.\n\nIn sociology and cultural anthropology, \"culture\" can also be grasped as a symbolic system, especially a symbolic symbol system. American cultural anthropologists C. Gilz has undergone such a definition: the so-called culture, \"human beings in order to convey the knowledge and attitude of life, making it inheritance and development, in the form of inheritance The concept system.\n\nT. S. Eliot in the book of Christianity and Culture, the cultural industry is customized as: a living in a nation living in the same area. Cultural art, social system, custom habits, and religion of the nation.\n\nThe core of culture is its symbol system, such as text. The various text systems have corresponding cognitive psychology.\n\nCulture has social, diverse, systematic and phased properties.\n\nCulture also features geographical, era, variability, inheritance, and so on.\n\nIn recent years, zoology research has found that some high ideas are widely distributed, such as traffder, kick whales, etc., their different regional groups, is not simple environmental habits, but in relation to humans, Have a certain cultural form.\n\nBy comparative study of different cultures to understand the characteristics of culture.\n\nFirst, cultural is a common, it is a series of common concepts, values \u200b\u200band code of conduct, which makes the common standards accepted by individual behavior as a collective. Culture is not from personality, and it is hosted to create self-group, not the genius individual can be original, but most of the results of the continuous efforts [8]: Sequence 1. Culture is closely related to society, there is no culture without society, but there is no culture that has no culture. Since culturality is the result of most people, there must be social, together with each other [8]: Preface 1. Inside the same society, culture also has inconsistent. For example, in any society, men's culture and women have different cultures. In addition, there is also a difference in subculture between different ages, occupations, and class.\n\nCulture is learned, not through genetics and is natural. The way physiological satisfaction is determined by culture, and each culture determines how these needs are satisfied. From this perspective, non-human primate also has some cultural behavior of cultural behavior, but these cultural behaviors and huge complicated cultural symbolic systems in human society are only slightly short.\n\nThe basis of culture is symbolic. These most important of these are languages \u200b\u200band texts, but also include other expressions, such as images (such as totem flags), limb movements (such as handshake or spitting tongue), behavioral interpretation (gift), etc. Culture is not in a state of still, but is developed in dynamics, and it is also desirable to rejuvenate [8]: Preface 1. Almost, the entire cultural system is to depth in human thinking through a huge symbolic system, and people also interpret all kinds of things presented in front of them through this symbolic symbol system. Therefore, how to interpret various symbols in this culture, become one of the important ways of interpretation of human minds in humanity and linguistics.\n\nIn 1976, Richard Daokins created a new word model in \"selfish gene\" book, indicating the process of cultural inheritance, and the evolution rules in biology to make a cultural gene [9 ]. The model contains a wide range of religion, rumors, news, knowledge, concept, habits, customs, or even slogans, proverbs, terms, words, and jokes, also evolved via replication (imitation), variation and selection process. The concept of replication will not be exactly the same as the original concept, so there is a variation. These similar but different concepts, they compete in each other during the spread, especially in the era of online online, the general concern affects the scope of the content, and the length of the time, there is a similar day. phenomenon.\n\nIn addition, cultural as a whole trend as a whole of each other.\n\nCultural invention means that a group of people can be helpful in its behavior, but it is not the invention of actual items. Humanity in a global \"cultural acceleration period\", because of international trade, mass media, more importantly, the explosive growth of the world population.\n\nCultural itself will be affected by support changes and opposition to the changes of the two parties. These strengths and social structures and natural events are related to some concepts and practices in the existing social structure, which may also be part of cultural evolution [ 10].\n\nThe development of social conflicts and technology can adjust the dynamics of society and put forward new cultural patterns and can change society. The evolution of these societies may accompany the metastasis of ideology, or other cultural evolution. For example, the US women's movement (English: feminist movement) and new practices in society have also caused changes in gender relationships, causing gender structures and economic structures. For example, after the end of the previous glacial period, the tropical forest began to appear, and there were plants that were properly planted, which brought the rise of agriculture, which later brought many cultural inventions and social dynamics [11].\n\nCulture is not a \"existence\", which itself is a \"evolution\"; if it is not evolved, the culture is killed, and the culture of death is lost. [8]: Sequence 2.\n\nCultural will be affected by contact between different societies, which may cause social and cultural evolution, or may prevent this evolution. War or resource competitors impact technology development and social power, in addition, cultural concepts may be transferred from a society to another by diffusion or implication. In the diffusion, a thing of a thing is transferred from a culture to another, but its significance may vary, such as Burgers' fast food, and become a symbol of exotic style after China. Stimulating diffusion (concept sharing) refers to an element of another culture or invented another culture. On the other hand, Direct Borrowing refers to a culture to another culture, and the technology or tangible material diffusion. Innovative diffusion theory is a research-based model that describes why individuals and a culture will accept new concepts, new things and new products, and the opportunities are also described.\n\nThere are many different significances in culturally related texts, refers to a cultural replacement of another culture, like some American Aboriginal people and the situation in the process of colonization in the process of colonization. The similar situation of individuals is assimilated (individuals adapted to different cultures) and cultural mutualization (English: Transculturation).\n\nGerman philosopher Kant has a personal definition of \"Enlightenment\": \"Enlightenment is an unproved from him.\" [12]. He believes that this immature is not from lack of understanding, but because there is no courage to think independently. For this kind of knowledge, Kant proposes \"Be brave in the wise!\" Like Held and other German scholars responded to Kant's appeal, although human creativity brings many unpredictable and multi-cultural results, but humans Rationality is important. Furthermore, Held proposed a group of collectors: \"For Held, the teaching is the sum of people's overall experience, giving people a common agreement, and the feeling of the same fate.\" [13].\n\nThe concept of high-cultural and civilian culture proposed by Adehua Burned Taylor application in 1870, proposed religious evolution (English: Evolution of Religion), he believes that the religion will slowly evolve from the gods to a god [14]. He also redefines the culture is the sum of all activities of human society. In the \"original culture\" book, he believes that culture is a complex whole, including knowledge, beliefs, art, moral, legal, customs, and any capabilities and habits that are employed as members of society. This is also preparing for modern cultural understanding. It is worth mentioning that Taylor is the first scholar that defines a culture.\n\nThere are a lot of classification methods of culture, which can be summarized as follows:\n\nThis classification below is a comprehensive application of time, region, and nation. Collection is a kind of collection, storage, classification and maintenance of the item. Collectors' collection objects are usually valuable antiques, but may also be other little things. Philatelic, matchbox stickers and postcards are more mainstream collection projects.\n\nThe collection is the behavior that exists from ancient morning culture. The collection of the Egyptian Tori Dynasty is known about the classics from all over the world in Alexander Library. Floros' beautiful family family collected artworks, and opened private sponsored artists, this tradition has been continuing today's art collectors. Many popular museums in the world, from New York Metropolitan Museum, Madrid Thorns - Bonimi Sa Museum to Mexico City Franz Maiyebo Museum, is a collection of collectors donated collections to be available to the people. Personal semen can be traced back to Cabinet of Curiosities, which started from Rudolph II, special collection of artistic treasures of art treasures. The planned collection can be traced back to George Tomson and Samuel Pest. In the 18th century Paris, London and Amsterdam have records in the collection and antique treasures and art markets. [1] In the 19th century industrialized country, because of the rise of leisure activities, more and more people put into the field of collection. At that time, the ancient Chinese porcelain, furniture and decorative items were rampant from the Oriental Countries.\n\nSince 1945, three Chinese people, including feuditis, Zhao Cao Xingcheng have been selected as the famous family of hundreds of private collections for the contemporary 100 private collection [2]. The diet is a wide name and concept, including eating, drinking related culture and as. Can refer to: Clothing (also known as clothing, clothes, clothing) The most general definition of clothing, in addition to covering the body of the tors, including hand (gloves), foot (sock, shoes, sandals, boots) with head (Hat) shield, and extension of clothing accessories. Almost all humans have a culture of clothing. Human wear clothes have social reasons. Many of the items in clothing have some kind of culture, religion and social significance. Certain colors are also related to gender, such as from the First World War, American society habits to boy from the boy, letting pink to join the girl, and the situation before the war is just the opposite.\n\nClothing can protect fragile humans from weather and environmental damage, in some potentially harmful activities (when hiking or cooking) can improve the level of security. Clothing can have an barrier in the middle of human skin and environment, so it is not easy to be hurt in insect bite or plant stab. Clothing allows the body to maintain a more comfortable temperature to avoid over-cooling or overheating. In healthy, clothing can also reduce toxic substances or infection into the body, and avoid ultraviolet injury to humans.\n\nIn addition to human beings, humans also designed costumes for animals. Some as a jewelry as a pet, some for war or specific protection needs. Such as helmets and freezers or space clothes.\n\nIf the population ratio is calculated, almost all human beings today are wearing clothes. But it is difficult to consider when people start wearing clothes. Under natural conditions, ordinary apparel will take decades will decompose, so the archeology is difficult to obtain relevant information. Nowadays, the prehistoric knowledge of clothing is basically based on tools that may be used to make clothing, the original person portrait and even biology research and other indirect evidence. The mitochondrial DNA detection made by the scorpion living in human clothes was shown in the first 21st century, which is more than 7.2 (\u00b1 4.2) long-term separated from parasitic in humans in human hair. According to this, it is inferred that the human wealth will wear costumes at 120,000 years ago [1] [2] [3], this time is close to the human entered African origin. According to this hypothesis, it has highly intelligent human beings from Africa from Africa, enters the relatively cold Eurasian area. [4] It is discovered that the tools that may be needed in the first 30,000 years ago, [5] The beasti may be the earliest costume, using the leaves, bark and vines to prepare clothes. Something, as for the use of fibers, it is more complicated with cloth. In various plant fibers, linen is the earliest use to prepare garments. It is known that the earliest linen fiber appeared in Georgia, 36,000 years. [6] [7] The whole textile is more difficult to find\n\nAnd why is human beings put on clothes, but also not so far. From ancient Greece, human beings began to consider this problem, and there is an influential hit from now on: [8] [9]\n\nIn fact, these hypothesis have problems that they cannot explain.\n\nThe most important function of clothing is to protect people in clothes, making it comfortable. When the weather is hot, the clothes can make people not be bothered. When climate is cold, the function of the clothes insulation is especially important. If it is in the room, the warm effect of the clothes is less important. For example, if in the room, people will take out the jacket, hats and gloves, especially when resting or sleep. Clothing is also related to regional and climate, like in a more hot area or more hot, we will wear more ventilated, cool clothes.\n\nClothes also have social and cultural functions, such as express personal characteristics, occupations, gender and social status [10]. Among many cultures, the standards of clothing reflect the terms (English: modesty), religion, gender and social status. Clothing can also see a person's taste and personal style.\n\nClothes can have a lot of different materials. Clothing material (English: Clothing Material) can be leather, fur to natural or synthetic fibers. But not all items covered in the body are called costumes. If it is carried instead of wearing items (such as leather bags, canes and umbrellas), it should usually be an accessory rather than clothing. As for jewelery and sunglasses, although \"wear\" is said to \"carry\" in ordinary speaking, they are often considered accessories.\n\nHumans will also use cosmetics, perfumes to decorate their body; they will make their hair, beards and hair, dyeing and changing, sometimes moving to the skin (tattoos, scars and wear caves). All of these decorations affect the overall clothing model, but it will not become part of the clothing.\n\nIn some special environments, special clothes are needed to protect the human body, and humans also invent many clothing in different environments, such as space coats, protective gear, diving, swimsuit, beekeepers, high energy costumes (English: high -visibility clothing and other protective clothing.\n\nSocial information conveyed by clothing, accessories and jewelry includes social status, occupation, morality and religious relationship, marital status, and sex suggestions. Humans must know that these symbols are identified by identifying messages. If different groups have different meanings for the same apparel or decorative interpretation, the clothes may inspire some of the reactions that they do not expected.\n\nIn many societies, people with high status will keep some special clothing or jewelry to themselves. Only the Roman emperor can wear costumes in dyeing a purple (English: Tyrian Purple); only high status Hawaii can wear feather coats with whale engraving. Only the emperor of the ancient China can wear twelve chapters and jackets. In many cases, some legal systems that suppress waste will manage who can wear. In some other societies, there is no law to prohibit the costumes of low status from wearing high status, but the high price of those in clothing naturally limit the purchase and use of others. In contemporary Western societies, only rich people can afford high-grade garment customization. Worried that it is also possible to limit the choice of clothing.\n\nMilitary, police, firefighters usually wear uniforms, and many employees in many companies are like this: For example, in some Japanese manufacturing companies, they will ask employees to wear uniform clean clothing, generally white; can express the company's product quality Requirements and rigorous style, but also weaken the difference between the same company's middle class. Primary and secondary school students often wear school uniforms, and college students are wearing college costumes. Religious members may wear a monks, robe, and \u8888\u88df. Sometimes it is a clothing or accessory that can communicate a person's occupation and / or class. For example, the top chef hat wearing the chef.\n\nIn many parts of the world, national costumes and clothing style representatives represent some people belong to a village, status, religion, and so on. A Scottish will declare his home world with a plaid; an orthodox Jew will use the side of Sidelock to declare his belief; a French country woman will use her hat (Cap or Coif) Announce her village.\n\nClothing can also be used to express a person's objection to its cultural norms and mainstream values, as well as individual independence. In the nineteenth century Europe, artist and writers will live in Bohemian-style life, and deliberately wear some costumes to shocked others: George Sand Wear male clothing, women's liberation movie wearing short lamp cage pants (Bloomers), male artist wearing velvet vest (Waistcoat) with trendel scarf. The Bohemian, a beatnik, a hippie, a Gothic, and a Trouke continued to conduct this anti-cultural tradition in the twentieth century. In recent years, it has been plagiarized in the street fashion in recent years. This may make the street fashion to lose some of the power of shocked others, but it still motivate countless people trying to dress yourself.\n\nIn the Islamic world and community, it usually requires any requirements for adult women Muslim. Usually, in addition to the face, the hand is required to cover all parts of the body. In addition to covering the head of Hitchca, further covering the whole body.\n\nMany clothing will show the end of the clothes. For example, many Muslim women will wear the head or body shield to show their status is a dedicated woman. Some costumes may have a teasing meaning. For example, a Western woman may wear a very high heel, exposed black or red dress, exaggerated make-up, gorgeous jewelry, and perfume to express its sexual implicit. What kind of clothing is dignified or teasing, between each culture, under the different contexts of the same culture, and the epidemic will have extreme differences over time. What is even more, some people choose to show mixed messages. For example, a Shawi Arab woman may wear a black yarn robe (English: abaya) to express its demon, but choose the luxurious fabric, and cut the black yarn, and then match the high heels and trendy leather bags. . These details are all expressly suggested, although the message on the surface is elevated.\n\nBecause clothing and jewelry often have many links with sex, humans may develop fetches for clothing. They may strongly tend to develop some people who think that they think of sexy and teasing costumes. In Western culture, these milestones may contain extremely high heels, lace, leather or military uniforms. Other cultures have other fetches. In the past few centuries, the male feudal period will generate sexual desire for women tied to the small feet (see wrapped). Male in the Japanese peace era will be eager to cut the parallel Liu Hai and women who put on several rots. The change in clothes is as much as the fashion. Sometimes the clothing itself will become objects of love, for example: some people don't wait for the underwear and shoes of underwear and footwear for others.\n\nClothing materials typically include compilation of various fiber products such as cotton, polyester, nylon, and finally processed by weaving fabric to clothing. Similarly, more materials in modern society have been introduced into the production of clothing materials, such as metal, paper, etc.\n\nCommon clothing materials are:\n\n\nMore uncommon clothing materials are:\n\nDamage of clothing comes from both inside and outside. In terms of inside, the human body falls off, the endocrined grease, the discharged sweat, urine and feces, which will make the clothes vargent. In the outer side, sunshine, moisture, wear and dirt can damage the surface of the garment. The flea and scorpion may also hide in the clothes. If there is no cleaning and repair, the clothing will make the body itchy, looks uncomfortable, or some functional losses (such as the like or zip may be damaged, the fabric is thin or even tear, etc.).\n\nSometimes people will always wear a piece of clothes, not clean until it can't wear it. Leather is not easy to clean, and the bark cloth will dissolve as long as it is washing. People can repair damage, remove the surface of the surface. However, the old leather and bark cloth look old old.\n\nHowever, most of the clothing is made of fabric, while most of the cloth is to wash and repair.\n\nThere are many ways to laundry, from the early stones on the stone next to the river to clean or dry cleaning with electric washing machine (dissolved with dry cleaning other than water). Dry or dry after washing. Some materials will shrink (such as wool, leather) or fading (certain silk products), which can be coated with chemical solvent dry cleaning.\n\nSome fiber materials, if it is only washed, wrinkles will appear, and it can eliminate the wrinkles on the clothes. Some fiber clothing is used for the material (English: Permanent_Press), even if it is not hot, there will be no obvious wrinkles.\n\nIn the past, weaving (English: Invisible Mending) is an art. A careful-wing tailor can not see the broken patch. Today, clothes are considered consumables. Large-scale costumes are lower than the handmade costs of repairing clothes.\nSo many people prefer to buy new clothes and do not want to repair clothes.\n\nThe unabled clothes that can be used can be used to make thin (English: quilt), rag, carpet, bandage, and many other home needs. The old clothes can also be recycled for papermaking. The old clothes are also collected, dealt with, and then transported to poor countries to continue to use after a large number of collections.\n\n[Edit in Wiki Data] Transportation refers to the exchange of people through the appliance (train, car, motorcycle, boat, plane, etc.), or only by manpower, passenger flow and freight flow, but generalized interpretation also includes interpersonal information such as post, telecommunications. The modern interpretation of this word is taken from Japanese release.\n\nTraffic is a prerequisite for commodity exchange. With the improvement of traffic, human material production has gradually transitioned from self-sufficient way to transition to division of labor. The division of labor of material products is one of the foundations of modern industrial society.\n\nTraffic can be roughly divided into land, sea and air transport.\n\nThe land is referring to transportation, such as automobiles, trains, etc. Because the cost of land is low, the main short distance transportation of most regions is land transport.\n\nThe sea refers to the transportation of transportation in the sea, such as ship, double body ship, etc. Because it can be sailed, the cost is limited, and the sea is usually used as transporting goods to another.\n\nAir freight refers to transportation, such as aircraft, helicopter, etc. in the air. Since the speed is faster, it is usually used as Intercontinental sailing. Sports or sports competitions are social activities for enhanced physical exercise, technology, training, competitive competition, etc., including social activities for cultural life, including all forms of competitive physical activity (English: Physical Activity) or games. The sports competition originated from ancient Greece.\n\nSports are the general name of entertainment of entertainment for participants in all organized or organic participants, through use, maintenance or improvement. [1] [2] There are hundreds of sports in the world, with a plurality of forms, and some need two people can be completed, and some need multiple teams to complete.\n\nSports are often considered all activities based on physical fitness or physical coordination capabilities. Large-scale sports events such as Olympic Games are only allowed to meet this defined sports into, [3] other organizations such as European Parliament also will not Activities in physical exercise elements exclude in the concept of sports. [2] However, there are some competitive features, but the activities lack of physical movements are also considered to be motion, such as mental movement. The International Olympic Committee will identify chess, Go, electricity and bridge as \"real\" sports, the international single Sports Federation will always determine 5 unhealthful sports, [4] [ 5] However, the brain motion that is identified as a sports is still not much. [1]\n\nSports often have a range of rules or traditions to ensure fair competition to ensure consistency for victory ruling. Determining whether the win or not may be a physical event, such as a hit score or first across the finish line, or a referee score the determined result according to the performance or subjective indicator.\n\nIn organized sports, there is usually a record of excellent performance, some popular projects, such information may be widely reported in sports news. At the same time, sports is also an entertainment for non-participants. Ornamental sports will often attract many viewers to visit the venue, and touch the broader audience through broadcast.\n\nWith the expansion of international exchanges, the scale and level of sports cause development is an important indicator of a country, social development, and has also become an important means of foreign diplomacy and cultural exchanges. The level of sports development in a country is measured by the following aspects: the level of physical fitness levels and sports in sports, the scientific theory level of sports and sports facilities, sports technology levels and the best exercise results.\n\nSports can be divided into large-scale sports, professional sports, school sports, sports competitions. Including sports culture, physical education, sports activities, sports competition, sports facilities, sports organizations, and sports science.\n\nIt is not uniform for how to distinguish between sports and leisure activities. The International Sports Association believes that a sports should meet the following conditions: [1]\n\nAccording to historical evidence, such as cultural relics and construction shows that China has begun to perform sports around 2000 BC. [6] Gymnastics is a very popular project in ancient China. It can be seen for the monument to the Lao to build, including swimming, fishing and other sports have developed and established sports rules in the ancient Egypt of thousands of years ago. [7] Other sports projects carried out in Egypt also include throw guns, jump and wrestling. The ancient Persian sports include traditional Iranian martial arts project hero sports, it is closely related to fighting skills. [8] Sports projects originated from ancient Persian also include malls and rushing to comparison.\n\nA large number of sports projects and competitive competitions have been produced in the ancient Greek period, and the development of military culture and sports in ancient Greek. Sports for ancient Greeks have a deep outstanding performance that they founded the Olympic Games, held a small village called Olympia in Bernonia every four years. [9] Spanish philosopher Fernando Savater believes that the sports competition is the direct product of democratic political construction; the first is that when the class legalization form of bloodline, God and wealth is invalid, it is necessary to find a social distinction from other sources; second It is only equal to compete with each other [10].\n\nSports have developed in the period of ancient Olympic Games, and its organizational and related rules have been strengthened. Industrialization has made more leisure time in developed and developing countries, which allows them to participate and watch governs, and the number of sports has increased, and spread more common. This trend is more pronounced with the strengthening of mass media and global linkages. Sports specialization becomes mainstream, sports more popular, sports fans chase professional athletes through radio, TV, and Internet, and they also participate in amateur sports, and they will work out and entertain.\n\nThe spirit of sports is a kind of pursuit of fair competition, and is a good gift for teammates and opponents, obeying morality, and sincere, regardless of winning, always keeps decent attitude. [11] [12] [13] For this, modern Olympic's father Pisel De Gu Becou Due has said: \"The most important thing is not losing, but participating, this is a classic for the spirit of sports. Statement.\n\nThe core principles of sports include that the results of sports should not be decided in advance, and both parties should win by the same opportunity. In order to ensure fair competition, people have developed the rules of competition, but participants can get the advantage by breaking the rules.\n\nParticipants may make their own desires by cheating, or some more hidden motives. For example, people participate in gambling for the results of the game, leading to a strong motor motivation, the entrant may deliberately put water in the game to ensure the expected result. For example, if the rule of the group is hoped to get a better group by putting water, such as at the 2012 Summer Olympic Games, China Badminton Team has given the ball for the gold and silver, and finally involved players have been ruled against physical education and being elapsed. Olympic Games. [14]\n\nThe competitive nature of sports makes some participants trying to improve their competitive performance by using drugs or other methods (such as increasing blood volumes in the body).\n\nAll sports projects recognized by the International Olympic Committee or International Sports Association should detect whether the athletes are banned, and they are found to have a positive athletes may be banned and recovered. Honors.\n\nAge, deception, etc., not only affect the fairness of the game, but also make the country and the victim of the country.\n\nViolence in sports often swims between fair competition and intentional aggressive violence. Athletes, coaches, and sports enthusiasts may have violence against people or property. In some national and international events, the phenomenon of riots is very common, and the organizer is plagued. Like football, American football, ice hockey, football, kangar, boxing, horn, water ball, and integrated fighting, etc. are easily violent.\n\nAt the same time, if the audience is like racial discrimination, discrimination, LGBT groups, chaos, fans riot, malicious injuries, etc., or the team itself has a violation of fair competition, the result may lead to the team's warning, fine, There is no audience competition, deduction points, severe downgrades, and even the name is possible.\n\nIf you do it, there are other improper behaviors, such as home storms, crimes, and the same point of punishment.\n\nFor example, the football member Suarez is a typical example. During the 2010 to 2014 World Cup, make a race discrimination black player, biting in 3 games, let him have not taken a red card, a total of 48 games, at the same time Pay more than $ 200,000, and a negative image of the public.\n\nAt the same time, it is possible to make a specific race and religious person to make a particular race, and a big trouble for the sports world. I don't know how to deal with it is the best (punishment is too light and relevant people to protest; if it will cause the parties Supporters protested to punish, considered to be free of behavior, and even resisted).\n\nThe exercise can be amateur, occupational or semi-professional, whether the participant is saved or salary due to participation exercise.\n\nSince viewing sports can be used as an entertainment that is for the non-participants, the exercise becomes a industry, and the high-pay culture of the professional movement is produced. Excellent athletes pay more than average salary bonus, up to millions of dollars [15 ].\n\nSome sports or individual competitions will only allow amateur athletes to participate. The Olympic Games starts only allows amateur athletes to participate, because if there is a professional athlete to participate, it is unfair to those athletes who think of interested only [16]. After the 1988 Olympic Games, the International Olympic Committee decided to participate in the Olympic Games, only the horn and boxing were still subject to amateur rules due to the rules of amateur and occupations.\n\nGrassroots refers to the exercise of the amateur participating, in line with the idea of \u200b\u200b\"People's Sports\", does not have a better exercise achievement, and the main purpose of participating in sports is entertainment [2] [17].\n\nTechnology is an important role in modern sports, and some of the exercises (such as racing), which can improve exercise in other sports.\n\nSports science is a comprehensive discipline for scientific analysis of human sports activities, which can be used in areas related to athletes, such as movable micromid-tuning movies, or some equipment, such as swimsuits and sneakers, etc.\n\nSports Engineering (English: Sports Engineering) is a discipline in 1988, not only focusing on the design of the equipment, but also focuses on the application of technology in sports.\n\nIn order not to let technology affect the spirit of fair competition in sports activities, sports authorities often set special provisions to control individual athletes due to unfairness.\n\nPolitical and sports often affect each other.\n\nIn 1936, the Summer Olympic Games held in Berlin may be the best example, and instructions can be publicized with sports activities to promote a particular ideology. The 1936 Summer Olympics is a typical example of political and sports symbiosis, with high propaganda Nazi Germany. At that time, Germany had already prepared for war, but using the Olympic Games to create a peaceful impression to the world, so the Olympic Games become a technique that hides an extremely military purpose. The lack of human rights is the shadow of the Olympics. At that time, the Nazi Germany was arrested in February 1933, and the first Jews massacre appeared in April 1933, in 1936. On July 12th, Saxony Gaosen concentration camp began to use, where the location is near the Olympics. A total of 22,000 people were arrested during the Olympic Games [18].\n\nMany athletes (especially rugby players) think they should not participate in South Africa during the period of apartheid policies. Some athletes believe that this is a positive contribution to the Final abolition of South Africa's apartheid policies, and some people think this has strengthened the bad influence of racial isolation [19].\n\nIn the Summer 1980, the Olympic Games held in the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, the United States and other countries launched a boycott of the Moscow Olympic Games, making events that only 80 countries participated in [20]. The four years later held in the United States, the Soviet Union and Eastern European Group and North Korea, Vietnam, and Lauga and other countries have boycotted four years later in the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles 1984 [21].\n\nIf there is a serious case of sports event violations, its violations, such as using banned drugs, negative competitions (fake balls), post-reported age, gender discrimination, sexual tendency discrimination, athletes collectively do not gently behavior (racial discrimination, inciting hatred, unpacking The competition unit and other entrants) and the competition unit advised invalid, ... and other violations, it can be recommended that the International Single Sports General will even decide directly to the international single-sports, and the track and field of Russia. Bulgaria's weightlifting is due to the banned incident, the Rio Olympics in 2016, while facing a fine, the plot is serious or even the intersection, and even single sports will always consider the expense of the membership. Entertainment is a great interest and interest that attract audiences, and makes the audience feel happy and satisfied, happy, dispel, relaxation, leisure, etc., and is different from education and marketing activities. It can be an idea, a task, but more likely to be an activity or event. Today, human entertainment has developed thousands of years, and has attracted audience attention [1]. Due to personal preferences, different entertainment is different, but most entertainment activities are considered to have universal appeal. Just like telling stories, music, drama, dance and various performances, general entertainment is almost popular in all cultures, most of them from the palace, develop exquisite and diverse skills, and heard the city well civilians. The contemporary entertainment industry mainly rely on the production and sales of entertainment products, and the development of this industry has rapidly accelerated the popularization of entertainment. In order to adapt to different sizes, entertainment has developed various forms: can be self-selected columns in private music services, or it can be suitable for two people's two banquets, and it can be no different national skin tones, including thousands of audiences, and dance music. International audiovisual feast.\n\nEntertainment is always closely linked to the fun (English: amusement). Although many entertainment forms are serious, such as ceremonies, celebrations, religious festivals, or allegories, but people can often take joy from it, and report to laugh. Thus, there is also such a possibility that these entertainment or can enhance people's insight or intelligence.\n\nThe audience of entertainment is an important aspect of entertainment. The audience is a person who can put his own overcome into entertainment. In the process of watching competitions, opera, or movies, the audience plays the role of passive recipients; in activities that are often interchanged in participants (such as games), the audience can be active. There are public entertainment in real life, and there are also personal entertainment; existing theater art and concerts, the content fixed entertainment, and children's games (English: List of traditional children's games) is not fixed, Spontaneous entertainment. Most entertainment has more than a hundred years of history and has continuously developed with cultural, scientific and trend, such as stage magic. Although movies and video games use new media, it can be traditionally retrosted to tell stories, modern drama, and traditions playing music. Music, movies and dance can create a festive atmosphere, even after the festival is also pleasing.\n\nFor example, disclosure, some activities have been considered to be a kind of entertainment in the past, but it is already far from the public. The fencing or archery is originally a necessary skill to survive, and now it has developed into a professional, professional sports, and has developed an entertainment form of more and more widely attractive. Life behavior such as cooking is also a survival skill in the past, and now it has become a public performance attended by some professional, and some are also on the stage, becoming an international event, spread out in the form of entertainment. So some groups or individual entertainment activities may be a formal job of another person.\n\nThe common form of entertainment can span different media through creative and re-fusion demonstrating unlimited potential. This also ensures numerous entertainment themes, image and structures to maintain consistency and persistence.\n\nEntertainment is different from education and marketing, although the two are well known how to use entertainment attractive to achieve their different goals. The academic community knows the important impact of entertainment [2] [3], and more mature entertainment also affects some academic fields including museums and practical activities in other fields. [4] [5]\n\nPsychologists believe that the purpose of spread entertainment is to \"get fun\" [6]. In addition to \"Accessible\", entertainment usually does not have other effects; the last ratio of the sports competitive entertainment project is removed, and there is no other interest effect. This is compared with the education (to help people learn as a target) with marketing (encouraging people to buy commercial products). However, when education is also trying to \"entertain\", when the combination of entertainment and marketing is gaining the meaning of education, the boundaries between them become blurred. Such a mixture is often known for new words \"educational entertainment\" or \"Information Entertainment\". The psychological theory of entertainment and learning has been applied in the above field. [7] Some \"Impressive\" attempts are the best apps that combine both the longevity [8] [9] Some people will also be happy to have a painful disorder (gloating).\n\nIn addition to giving pleasure, entertainment can also provide some profound experiences for the audience. Entertainment may be delicious to design some universal philosophical topics into its performance, such as \"What is the meaning of life?\" \"What is the meaning of people?\" \"What is what I should?\" \"How do we know us?\" Cognition? \"This kind of problem has spawned a lot of plot bridges, existed in many stories, movies, drama, poetry, classic, dance, animation or game form. Take the drama, in the \"Hamlet\" in William Shakespeare, the characters use poetry to express these philosophy; another \"hacker empire\" [10] in-depth discussion of the essence of knowledge; these works are also Thoughts spread to all over the world [11]. At the same time, a long novel is worried, but also provides a broader perspective for the demonstration of such profound themes [12]. Among them, the \"Galaxy Tour Guide Series\" is adapted to various forms because of its vivid and creative fun exploration of philosophical problems: the initial comedy radio show, because it is too popular and adapted to the novel, movie, TV series , Stage drama, comics, audio books, butter-grain records, adventure games, online games, etc. There are many inferses that are widely circulated. (See \"Galaxy Tour Guide\" Speech), related works have also been translated into multiple languages \u200b\u200b[13], covering the meaning of life, entertainment ethics, artificial intelligence, multiple worlds , God, philosophical methodology, etc. [14].\n\nMost of the story is still some older techniques, these techniques use words, images, sounds, and gestures to communicate experience, show things. [15] The story is not only a means of inheriting cultural values, traditions and history, but also an important part of entertainment. Despite the changes in years, the form of stories maintains its initial form, such as people still sit around and listen to stories when they are camping, and visitors will listen to those coming from different cultures when they travel. The earliest series of stories has been written in books today, but they have no doubt that they have passed on the ears, and their power is exactly the same as the elements we can also appreciate in today's movies and novels. . [16]\n\nThe story has been evolved toward the \"diversified\" development [16]. Many entertainment activities including stories, especially music and drama, although familiar with people, but have developed various forms to meet the needs of different personal interests and cultural expressions. Many types require other types of support and fusion. For example, storytelling, drama and banquet usually require music to render atmosphere; sports and games will join other activities to increase their fun. Some have evolved into professional and indispensable sports competition items (such as running and jumping). It is said that the struts are high \"may originate from the Netherlands, the Dutch people use long rods to cross the wide rivers, so that there is no wear of wood shoes to take a few miles to reach the nearest bridge.\" It is also believed that the pole may originate from the war to use the struts to the Fortress High Wall [17]. This moving equipment becomes more and more delicate. For example, the initial pole is made from the woods of the trees, the mountains, or the woods. Bottles are used in the 19th century, and the carbon fibers are used in the 21st century [17]. Other activities, such as stepping on stilts, can still be seen in circus performances in the 21st century. The Horn Fighter battle is popular in the Roman era, and is also known as \"Gladia Game\", which is also an example of combining sports, punishment, entertainment elements. [18] [19]\n\nEntertainment will change in the transformation of cultural or historical changes. For example, hunting wild animals are introduced from Carthage to Rome and become popular public entertainment activities, and also driven wild animals international trade. [20]\n\nEntertainment will also be influenced by the social turmoil of war and revolution, evolution into different forms. For example, the revolutionary sample show for the promotion of the Cultural Revolution, there is also the first world war, the Great Depression, and the Russian revolution has also impact enliers. [21] [22] [23] [24] [25]\n\nThe factors such as times, fashion, culture, technology and economies have continued to affect entertainment, and also produce relatively small changes to the form and location of leisure entertainment. For example, a story in dramatic form can be presented in the open-air theater, the concert hall, the cinema and the studio, or by more advanced technical means, such as a tablet. Most of the audiences have a specialized architecture to enjoy entertainment, such as theater, auditorium or stadium. One of the most famous entertainment venues in the Western world, the Roman Boucus, presented a 100-day game in the 80s of the AD, 50,000 viewers \"enjoy\" this bloody stage competition. [26] Shengjing, competition, racing and sports have presented to the audience in such a special building. Nowadays, in order to meet the growing demand for global audience, there is a continuous new stadium began to build.\n\nEmpire royal and courts provide training venues and support for professional artists, different cultures create palace and castle in different ways. For example, in the Mayan civilized city, the stage often plays in the large square in front of the Palace, and the crowd will gather in the view or watch it in a location specified from far. [27] The court entertainment will also span different cultures, for example, Durba is introduced into India by Mughal, and then introduces the Empire of the Empire, and still follows the Indian tradition: institution, title, customs, and is Ceremony with Natai, and so on. [28] In the Korean Peninsula, the court dance as a kind of entertainment started in the court banquet. [29]\n\nCourt entertainment is often the popularity of the court to Pu civilians. This is the case, which is the foundation of the rural shaman education, and eventually become an entertainment form of ordinary people. [30] Another example is the Narbje (English: Nautch) dancer in the Mohed: Nautch, which was only performed in the Hindu Palace Temple. Similarly, there is a change from religious rituals to secular entertainment, such as the ceremony of ancient Korea Dynasty, \"The initial purely religious ceremony is just the secular\". \" [31] The previous court entertainment, such as the medieval spear, and still in children's games.\n\nIn the palace in the Byzantine Empire, especially the upper class entertainment, at least in the Kohun Dynasty, demanding gender: Men and women are strictly separated during some entertainment activities such as receptions and banquets. [32]\n\nThe chartroom ceremony, the court gathering, the grand scene associated with it is not only used, but also used to show wealth and power. Such events can strengthen the relationship between the ruler and the ruler; between the erectors and the universal, \"the differences between ordinary families and rulers are exhibited in the form of drama.\" [33] Whether in the traditional court or in modern awareness, this situation is almost the same, like the 1997 Hong Kong regression ceremony, banquet, carnival, fireworks, holiday performance, and art exhibitions have been concentrated in regular regime. The court ceremony is a typical service to serve the royal family and ministers, and it is also \"for the master and the high official official\". [34] The Golden Age, the court will have traditional dance. [34] In Sudan, there is a so-called \"suturing drum\" and \"drum\" and \"drums\" in the palace band of power. They are used to make music; \"speaking\" in the ceremony; Record the community's big events; send long distance information; there is also a call for people to hunt or war. [35] [36] [37]\n\nThe court entertainment also shows the complex relationship of performers and audiences: Individuals may have the identity of the entertainment and audience, and sometimes their identity will be interchanged in entertainment. In the hall of Versailles, \"Thousands of ministers, including men and women who live in, all the roles of the performers and bystanders in the daily ceremony, and protect their identity. [33]\n\nA court entertainment that is involved by royal family, such as the coronation and wedding, providing opportunities for collecting aristocrats and people at the same time. For example, it is excellent in 1595 Elizabeth, the tournament, gun competition, and other such activities, not only present, not only in all the court collectors, but also in a good day. The event and thousands of Londen people who are hungry. This day, a series of activities in the hillion of the White Hall Palace, priced twelve coins. \"[38]\n\nAlthough most entertainment has migrated over time, some of the forms of past have been accepted by the public. For example, in the early centuries of European, observing or participating in punishing criminals or homeless executions is an entertainment for the public and more popular. In the past, there were many people who were humiliated behavior and provided some entertainment for the public to a certain extent. Even some of themselves such as hackers or beheads, although it is actually a public warning for the public, many cases are also seen as a kind of entertainment. There is also a longer duration of duration, such as stone punishment and mount, has become a larger public entertainment. As historians described: \"Syngense is a carnival, whether unemployed, citizens, bourgeois or curious nobles, can watch from carriages or rent a house.\" [39] As an entertainment Activities, the public prison has been continuous until the 19th century, and \"some grand public snired activities have been disgusted by some literaryists or philosophers.\" [39] Including Charles Dickens and William Meksbis Saclai wrote articles about New Gente prisons in 1840, hoping to \"teach a broader public, identifying the reality is an entertainment \". [39]\n\nChildren's main entertainment activities are playing, which is significant for their growth and learning. Adults can also provide or teach some entertainment activities to attract their entertainment, such as parcels, clowns, mime and cartoon. These are usually liked by adults. [40] [41]\n\nChildren are always playing. Playing is not only a kind of entertainment, but also helps their physical and mental development. The painter old Peter Bruger completed his painting in 1560 \"Children's game (English: Children% 27s_games_ (bruegel)\", this is a famous oil painting showing the content of children. According to the content of the painting, it is probably able to know what games are playing in that age. Among them, there are some games, such as bubbles, hide and seeking, and \"ride pigs (English: Piggyback_ (Transportation))\", etc., it has continued to this day.\n\nMost entertainment can be more adaptable to children's needs and meet children's interest. Since the 20th century, people believe that children's psychological development is divided into different stages, and their abilities and adults are different. This understanding begins in Stanley Hall, letting Chiajie have done a deeper Research and development. Hall \"promotes the establishment of the research and psychology laboratory of the development theory\", [42] Although there is always a criticism of Hall's knowledge and theory, his knowledge and theory have still important in the field of psychology. Status; Piajie \"found that the process of cognitive development is similar to the process of physiological development.\" [43] Based on the theory of this type of psychology research, people began to create stories and activities for children's audience, and are applied to books, movies, and video games. In the context of digital entertainment, some countries responded to the special needs of children's psychological development, formulating related industry standards such as TV grading systems, to better guide the public and entertainment industry.\n\nIn the 21st century, like adult network products, many online entertainment can be available for children's tentacles. This more than the previous era has formed a major change. Children have a longer playing time in the interior. In the outdoor contact, there is less time, this phenomenon attracts people's criticism to network entertainment, people think that online entertainment is cultivated to children's imagination, adult cognition And mental health has a negative impact. [44] [45] [46]\n\nFrom ancient times, the banquet has been an entertainment. Until the 21st century, some traditional roles were still kept in the banquet - a good impression on the guests.\n\nFormer visitors, especially those important guests (4, 6, 9); hospitality (2, 3, 4, 8); entertainment activities such as music or dance, or both (2, 3). In the court in the court, it is an indispensable part (3, 4) to help artists temper their skills (2, 3), and become an important part of the celebration. Wedding (7), birthday (10) Political events (5) and military activities or victory (6) Religious obligations (1). In modern, the banquet is commercial, for example, in a restaurant (10) and combined performance dinner theater (English: dinner theater). Professional chef cooking has also become an entertainment form, that is, cooking performances, to a certain extent, a way to entertain, better than the method country, a world cooking contest (English: Bocuse d'or).\n\nMusic is the basic component of most entertainment activities and one of the forms of expression. For example, music is used to enhance the emotion of narratives, in dancing (1, 4) and theater, are not indispensable, often used in drama or drama movies. [47]\n\nMusic itself is also a common and popular entertainment, it is also a way of expressing, such as concerts (2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). According to the rhythm, musical instruments, expressions and styles, music can be divided into classical, jazz, folk (4, 5, 8), rock, pop music (6, 9) or traditional music (1, 3). Since the 20th century, singing music is only available to the audience that can pay the performance of the performance, and the entertainment industry provides play or pre-sale services to individuals.\n\nRegardless of the player (6), the choir (2) or the orchestra (5, 8), whether there is any post-production (6, 7, 9, 10), all kinds of expressions belong Music scope (3). These venues used in live performances have a small, expensive, and indoor and outdoor, and also lead to different expectations of artists and their roles. For example, some viewers like quiet and enjoy music, and they will connotation (5, 8). Other viewers like the atmosphere of live performances and will be happy (7, 9). Most of the time, the audience chooses to entertain (10) by appreciate the pre-recording music.\n\nMusic can be divided into vocals (2, 6) and instrument (1, 3), or acoustic music (4, 5, 7, 8). Regardless of sound or instrument, artists can play alone, or participate in performances in a part of the group; contrary, the audience may be alone (10), passers-by (3), a few people (1, 2) or a large group of people (6, 7 8, 9). Although some forms, especially no accompaniment chorus and flunel do not accompany, general songs have musical instruments. Modern concerts often use a variety of special effects and related performances, accompanied by song and dance performances (7).\n\n\n\nThe game is usually for entertainment, but sometimes playing games is also to obtain a sense of accomplishment or substance. According to different gameplay, the game can be played alone, play with others, but also online; whether amateur players or e-sports players can play games together. Players can also watch games as bystanders, such as watching international chess championships.\n\nGame appliances are different from games. Like a chessboard game, such as Go, Chess or Western Chess, etc., there is a chessboard and chess pieces. At present, the oldest board game is known, is the ancient Egyptian LaOmmond, Sertite. Card games such as poker, bridges and Wheasted (English: WHIST), come back to the evening entertainment between friends, and these games only need a pangrack. Other games, such as Bingo, require special organization, and bystanders can participate in the game by betting. There are also many children's games, but the children can play outdoors, including hulls, hide and seeking or blind, and touch people (English: BLIND MAN's BUFF). The type of ball movement is quite wide, including baseball, grass and color bombs, and many ball sports projects. These game methods exercise skills to meet fitness needs. Sports games can improve sports skills and enhance physical fitness. The puzzle game like a digital game and the Rubik's cube can develop players' intelligence to a certain extent.\n\nVideo games use controllers and screens to interact with players. Some video games can also be played online, and the player is remotely involved. Starting from the second half of the twentieth century, the number of such games has increased, providing new entertainment methods for players around the world. [48] \u200b\u200b[49] The video game is very popular in East Asian countries such as South Korea. [50]\n\nReading for a long time is the source of people's entertainment, compared to other forms, it is relatively cheap, more easily obtained. As Bacon said, \"Reading can be pleasant, you can be long, you can\" \"Even if there is some serious work, readers can learn from it, solve the troubles in life. And many stories and information are inherited by speaking or language performance; but over time, the text has become a better inheritance [53]. The production of printing, paper, further reducing the cost of reading, and also improving the attraction of the public. In addition, with the development of technology, the quality of books is getting higher and higher, the typography, printing, and binding are more refined, so \"Reading is no longer the painful understanding process, turning into a pure fun \". [54] By the sixteenth century, the fun of reading has been deeply rooted in Europe.\n\nSome literary genre is rare, some or all of them serve in entertainment. For example, five lines of oil poetry use their rhythm format to make humor and entertainment. In addition, interactive game books like \"thrilling intersections\" allow people to participate in writing entertainment.\n\nCartoon comics is a literary genre with painting and image as a carrier. It is usually equipped with a story of some entertaining. [55] Many contemporary comics are full of fantasies, from some companies under the entertainment industry; there are some comics unique to their authors created a more personal, philosophical worldview, showing some problems in people. Super hero genre comics, such as superman comics, belong to the former. [56] The latter has a popular comedy \"Peanut\", which is made from Charles Shuzi to 50 years, [57] [58] describes the character relationship between children; [59] There is also a weird comic cartoon made by Michael, Michael Leunig, has also caused social disputes. Japanese comics is different from Western parties in their diversified genre, facing the theme of all age groups. The irony is the use of iconic entertainment, which not only gives laughter, but also adversely improved social consciousness by ridiculing some morality of the characters.\n\nComedy is both a kind of recreational art. Whether in order to please people, as a unique serious work, it gives people a laughter, providing people with fun. It is also an important part of many entertainment forms, existing in literature, drama, opera, movies and games. [60] [61] In the Royal Court, such as the Byzantine Court, it may also be in the rich family. \"The Merma is being carefully planned, and it is expected to be forced to take care of everyone, even emperors and Other royal members can't help. This high-level temptation, the character needs to have humorous words, such as laughing, joke, insulting, laughing, can also need to be ignorant and non-words humor, such as the farce and prank on the scene of the audience. [32] In the Middle Ages, all the types of comics related to Yue, Madi, Hump, Gnome, and Knitting, are \"considered homogeneous,\" about fool \", not necessarily ridiculous, but all represent\" individual Disadvantages. [62] [63]\n\nThe 17 comedy of Shakespeare contains many techniques that are still used by comedies and actors, such as jokes, double words, imitations, words, observed gimmicks, or unnecessary ironic effects. [64] [65] Dragoth show and ironic are also used in the comedy effect of literature. In the farce, it is a major purpose.\n\nOver time and the change of culture, the meaning of the word \"comedy\" and the audience have changed. [66] Simple action comedy, such as farce, most of the ages are entertainment. However, with the increasing culture, its forms and allusions may have a subtle difference due to different countries: better than English humor, in a cultural interesting thing or even possible in another culture, I can't understand it. . [67]\n\nOn-site performance in front of the audience is a major entertainment form, especially before the audio and video inventions. Various forms of performances, including drama, music and dance drama. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the European Court presented a full of complex drama covered with dance, singing and performance. Opera is also a high-aspirated performance form, and it is still popular. It combines three performance forms, requiring high levels of music technology and stage skills, collaborative and supercomprerates like a false drama.\n\nThe audience generally uses applause to express their appreciation of entertainment performances. However, all performers are unable to attract audiences, thus can't entertain the public's risk. The dissatisfaction of the audience is usually very honest and straightforward.\n\nTelling a story is an ancient entertainment form that affects almost all other entertainment. It is not only a kind of entertainment, but also thinking about the conflict between humanity and contradictions. \" [16] Therefore, although the story can be directly subject to the public, it is also used as an entertainment and makes a part of the work depending on the narrative work, such as movies, drama, ballet and opera. The content carrier of the story is often conferred by the printed technology, such as mud gold decorative hand copy and Japanese ancient scrolls. [69] On the trip, telling the story is still a common entertainment way of an active team atmosphere. Joe said in his literary work in the 14th century \"Canterbury story collection\", just like Wu Yen, the 16th century, in the \"Journey to the West\", showing stories to send time and entertainment travel The role of people. Although there are many travel now, but in the automotive and planes, passengers still listen to the words passing, or the story plays with other technical means.\n\nThe strength of the story is visible. The most famous is the Shan Ruode (English: Scheherazade) saved his life by telling a story. [70] [71] [72] Contacts in different forms of entertainment are often inspired by these different stories, and then reflect in other media; for example, in music, movies or games different forms. Another example: Composer Rimsky-Kazakov, Raewell and Carol Safen have created a new orchestra after he was inspired by Shan Rudod's story; director Pasas Reni has adapted the \"one thousand and one night\" movie; the new video game \"Arab Dream\" also borrowed this legend. The story may not exist in the form of text, and through music, dance or puppet play, such as the Java traditional wow, the Java traditional wow accompaniment, or similar Pan Interest (English: Punch and Judy) )Performance.\n\nEpic, poetry, legend and fables tell the legend of these excipients, which inspires a variety of entertainment. For example, Hinduism, \"Luo Mama\" and \"Maha Bhara Rondo\"; Homer's epic \"Odyssey\" and \"Yilian\"; the first Arab novel \"Hayy Ibn Yaqdhan (English: self-study philosopher)\"; Persian Epic \"Lian Wang Ji\"; Icelandic Legend (English: Sagas of Icelanders) and the famous \"source\". The story set such as \"Green Tale\" or \"Andersen's Fairy Tale\" is also far-reaching. These folk stories published in the 19th century have had a huge impact on modern pop culture, so that their themes, images, symbols and structural elements are used to create new entertainment. [73]\n\nThose who are most appealing, the longest story, some are the most basic stories, also known as the origin of myth (English: myth of origin) or create myth, such as Australian Dream (English: DREAMTIME) myth, Meso Negmia's Gilgamesh Shi Shi Shi [74], or the story of Hawaii in the world. [75] At the same time, these basic stories have also been adapted as books, movies, music and games, which continues the life of these stories and improves their entertainment.\n\nThe theater performance is usually dramatic or music, presented to the audience on the stage, and its history can be traced back to the Greek era. At that time, \"The\" Happy Person of Actor \"in Delphi, Tioli, Epretic\" Poetry The performance of the competition. [76] Aristotle and his teacher Plato have a book to introduce the theory and purpose of the theater art. Aristotle puts forward some problems, such as \"What is the role of artificial figures? What is the members of the ruling class should only watch performances or become a participant in performance? What should I provide for those who don't belong to elite? Entertainment? \"[77] In Egyptian Polesi, there is an ancient drama tradition in Buna Momo, and later, the aristocrats of Rome held a\" more luxurious performance \". [78] [79]\nThe masses have changed changes over time (1) over time. [80] For example, in England in the 18th century, \"the prejudice to the actress disappears\". [81] At the same time, in Europe, generally to go to the theater is \"a more elegant middle class recreation\" [82] In the late 19th century, many popular entertainment activities have been added. The light opera and public concert hall have appeared, Russia opened a new theater, such as Moscow Art Theater and the Russian Souvin Theater. [83] At the same time, commercial newspapers started The aater column and comments are published, which makes the theater become the \"theme of intellectuals debate\" in the ordinary discussion of art and culture. [83] The masses began to gather together, \"Appreciate artistic achievements, these 'star' is sought after and welcome. \"[83] Song dance juggling performance and concert hall are very popular in the United States, England, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, but they are finally replaced. [84]\n\nDrama, [85] musical, [86] universal show, mime, and poetry reading is part of the long history of theater, these performance types are commonly referred to as single comedy. [87] In the 20th century, radio and TV often live live broadcast, Continuing the form of a series of drama traditions in form innovation.\n\nThe air land set to the audience in front of the stage and the stage constitutes a theater. What kind of seats are there, what kind of stage, including the temporary treasted stage (2, 3, 6), temporary construction stage (2), carefully designed stage (9), or a long-lasting stage (5, 7). It is also possible to divide (2, 4, 6) in accordance with the indoor stage (3, 5, 9) and the open stage. Techniques for managing, organizing, and preparation of stage performance are called \"stage technology\" (10). The audience's entertainment experience is affected by their own expectations, stage technology, stage type, and seating type and standard.\n\nThe film is a major entertainment form, but all the movies are entertaining as their main purpose: such as documentary usually in order to record certain deeds or disseminate some information, [88] Sometimes these two destination coexist. This media is a global business at its beginning of its birth: \"Lu Miji brothers took the lead in assigning photographers to go to the world, let them take everything that may make people interested.\" [89]\n\nIn 1908, the Baidi Film Company issued a news movie, [89] In the first World War, the public entertainment has a huge demand for the movie. \"In the 190s, there were some fictitious plots and news movies in some movie programs.\" [89] \"Americans first created a way to create visual motion illustratively through continuous screens.\" However, the French people convert this scientific invention into a profitable business performance. \" [90] So the film has become part of the entertainment industry from the early days of its appearance. More and more complex technologies are used to entertain the public in the movie media. For example, the role and object movement in cartoons are rapid, and this technical technique is strongly attractive to small audience. [91]\n\nThe emergence of computer imaging (CGI) technology in the 21st Century makes people with a lower cost to make a grand scene and spectacular effect. These production effects and scale are the filmmakers in the era of Sepil Demir can't imagine. [92] The mass media existed between the 1930s and 50s has only movies and broadcasts, but since then, in the 1960s, the technical innovation, economic decision-making, risk avoidance, and globalization have caused film production. The quality is reduced, and the range is reduced. [93] Complex visual effects and CGI technology instead of live performances, not only used to create lifelike characters, landscapes, (realistic subjects, and fantasy works), but also in animation production, such as Lao Games or toys in real life create an animated movie. [94] \"Lego Movie\" production team \"I hope that the audience thinks that they have been placed on the desktop, take the real Lego building blocks filled with the camera, let the audience unable to identify a lot of scenes in the actual movie is made by the computer Made of music highlights digital images. [94] Computers and movies have created new entertainment rendering, and new technologies also allow some conditional people to use the family theater to broadcast movies, and they can enjoy the quality and experience of public theater in private venues. This is similar to those of the previous aristocrats in the past few centuries, or build a stage in the big house, the practice of organizing the drama performance is very similar.\n\nSome movies are new entertainment contents for other entertainment, such as stories, books, and drama, and re-creation. [95] \"Movie History\" is a documentary about \"Movie\", and the film leads the audience to overcome the film medium to achieve the achievements and innovations made by the world, as well as the innovation of the film production concept. In the film, although there are some movies, especially traditional American movies, it usually combines \"realism and popular dramatic\" [96], intentionally communicates with the world, but there are some movies. It is intended to let the audience have a more profound thinking about movies. For example, the theme of \"Hara\" (Xala (English: Xala)) is the government's corruption. Charlie Chaplin's movie \"big dictator\" is a bold and innovative funny movie, and its theme is related to politics. Some stories that have thousands of years have been re-interpreted and moved on the big screen, so there is a movie like Hongjo: Due to death. These films typically use common literary rhetoric, such as fables and antiquacience, and use new production technologies such as CGI to explore some profound themes, such as human limitations, goodness and evil, courage, and despair, Love, faith, and death, these themes have always been the topic of all kinds of entertainment forms. [97]\n\nLike other media industries, all kinds of awards have a variety of awards, including the APEC film, including the Asia-Pacific Film Award, and awards issued by American Film Arts and Science Societies, British Movies and TV Arts, France.\n\nA variety of dances are different, and those who have different cultures provide entertainment. Dance may have a serious style, such as when it expresss cultural history or important historical events. It can also be teasing, and it is also possible to have comedy effect. It is because it combines a variety of entertainment forms, including music, action, narrative, atmosphere, which can demonstrate a variety of combined methods of these entertainment, and how to produce different entertainment effects, entertaining audiences.\n\n\"Dance is a 'cultural expression form', but it is not only involved in dancers, but also people, audiences, sponsors and brokers, etc. from all over the world and people from all ages. [98] from Africa, Asia and Europe Dance, never stop in the influence of political, social, spiritual and art. \"[99]\" Although dance customs may be privileged, the dance is progressing. For example, Africa's' Da Dance ',' Haosa Dance ',' Marseille Dance '. [100] Ballet is a highly developed Western dance form. The main performance occasion of the ballet in the Louis 14th period from the French court to the theater, dancers Become a professional drama performer. [101] Some dances, such as the French \"Four Dance\", known as the \"Square Dance of Napoleon\". [102] Other rural dance [103] I used to be a social relationship like a dance At the party, [104] [105], now, now almost tutaches. On the other hand, many national dances (such as Scottish Highland Dance and Ireland Dance) have evolved into dance competitions, and increase their entertainment by increasing the number of viewers. Value. \"\" The traditional Irish dance steps and music \"Irish dance drama have developed into a world-famous important dance form. \"[106]\n\nDue to the common dance of the \"experience with women's body and women\" [99], female dancers are sometimes considered \"indisperse\", because they \"make a living in their own, rather than covering the body as much as possible.\" [107] The attitude towards the female dancers depends on the culture, history and entertainment industry itself. For example, some cultures regard women's dancing as \"the most shameful entertainment form\" [108], and other cultures have established a casprison, such as stripping clubs, in these places, professional women's strippers perform content in public Taste or hint dance, and the audience is mainly male.\n\nVarious political systems are almost tried to limit or ban dance or prohibit specific types of dances, sometimes blaming the music or clothing used in these dances. Nationalism, power and racism try to ban dance. For example, in the Nazi Germany, the American dance is like swing dancing, and it is considered to be \"completely non-Germany\", \"has become a cultural invasion, it needs to be prohibited.\" [109] In the 1930s, China Shanghai, \"Dance and Nightclub marked the enthusiasm of Chinese society\", and the bureaucrats confused whether both and \"other forms of entertainment activities, such as \u5a3c\u5a3c\". However, the ban even makes the dance activities \"more crazy.\" [110] In Ireland, the 1935 public ballroom law \"banned in the crossroads and elsewhere, such as the house and the barn dancing, but did not take effect.\" [106] In the United States, various dances are complicated Or metaphorical performances, [111] or like swing dancing is related to African Americans. [112] \"After the Nort-South War of the United States, African American dancers are often banned in black performances.\" [113]\n\nDances can be carried out by single (1, 4), or in double (2, 3), or groups (5, 6, 7) or even form a large-scale group dance (10). They may temporarily team (4, 8) or have highly organized (1, 2, 5, 10), may also be spontaneous (for example, children dancing, just to please yourself); may have a specific viewer (4) Or pay the audience (2), or publicly ornamental (10) in the world, or only the audience who is interested in this dance (3, 5). These dances may be part of the celebration, like a wedding and New Year (6, 8), or to become a cultural ceremony for specific purposes, like the Dahai Warriors Jumping Harbon Dance (7). Some dances, such as traditional dances in 1, ballet, require high level training skills; other dances, such as Kang Kang dance, need healthy body and strong physical fitness. The entertainment audience is part of the dance purpose, but the dance itself can bring fun to dancers (9).\n\nHuman proven animals for entertainment, there is already a thousand years of history. In order to make music, they will hunt them (rather than seeking food), and some people will hold a performance circus, bullfight, and a monkeys such as a specific day. For example, in an ancient Roman time, ancient Romans often live in the fun of the audience through the play of the animal. They watched \"Lions and bear dance in the music of the flute and the music; the horse is trained into a kneeling, bowing position, dance and performance ... The acrobats are on the wild lion, and jump on the wildlives.\" \"Performance of these violent conflicts with the beasts\", \"\" Over time, it becomes more barbaric and bloody. \" [114]\n\nThose entertainment for human beings, and forming a well-trained daily activities or \"behavior\" animals, including the flea in the circus, the dolphins in the whale fetus, and the monkeys of the street organ players. In ancient times, animals are often stored in the zoo, as an entertainment or a new thing with entertainment value. [115]\n\nMany animal competitions are now seen as sports - for example, horse racing is considered to be a sports and an important entertainment. Its economic influence makes it a global industry. In this industry, Ma is carefully transported to the world to participate in the competition. In Australia, the Melbourne Cup horses the game day is a public holiday, while the public regards this game as an important annual event. Just like horse racing, Tailong needs a human rider, but the game is not available. People feel very interesting to watch animal competitions, whether they are trained, such as horses, camels or dogs, are still trained, such as cockroaches.\n\nEntertainment is usually controversial, especially those that hunting wild animals. Some animal competitions, such as bear, bucket, and cruel games, have been used as public entertainment, which was banned due to some abuse of animals. Other controversies is still controversial. For example, for the game of shooting pigeons, \"the opponents believe this is a cruel, stupid shooting practice, and supporters think it is a kind of entertainment,\" both sides argue in court. [116] As an entertainment that requires horses and hounds, Bull is an entertainment with a strong drama effect, and has their own unique long-term cultural history. They are related to animals and are considered to be a sports, entertainment or cultural tradition. In animal rights protection tissues, some people worry about whether to use animals to entertain whether they are deprived of animal rights. [117] However, \"for many of many animal protection organizations and organizers organized by animals, both parties have their own cultural appeals.\" [118]\n\nCircus described as \"the most shameless entertainment\", [119] is a special drama show, including a variety of physical skills, such as acrobatics and juggling, and sometimes include animal performances. Usually the circus is considered to be in a huge circular tent, and the beginning is fixed at the beginning, and it changes to the tour performance.\n\nIn the second half of the 18th century, Philip Astley is called the founder of modern circus, while French actor Jules L\u00e9otard is said to create circus art and almost become a symbol of circus. [120] At the traditional British Expo, Astere's performance \"starts at least from the beginning of the 17th century\" is very common: \"Roll, rope dance, juggling, animal trays, etc.\". [119] Some people claim that there is no direct contact between the Roman Circus and the Modern Circus ... After the \"Roman Circus\" died, Asterley took the foundation of the circular theater before London, it was approximately 1300 curious onlookers gathered on the grass on the grass in the village. \"[121]\n\nThis kind of entertainment is called \"magic\" and is considered a performance, which is based on the tradition and text of the magical ceremony and religion of most cultural traditions since ancient times. (For example, some magic reference materials can be found in the following documents: the Bible, Hermensian, Shero Association, Kabara culture, the mysterious and mason's source.) [122]\n\nStage Magic can perform in front of various media audiences: on the stage, on TV, street, and dispatch or event. It is often combined with other forms of entertainment, such as comedy or music, and performance skills are usually an important part of the magic performance. Magic performance relies on deception, psychological operation, various forms of tricks and tricks to the audience a magician can complete the illusion of impossible things. The audience is amazed in Harry. Hudini's stunt performance and escape, for example, it will think he is a magician. [123] [124] [125]\n\nThe magician has an important role in the literary works of hundreds of years and provides entertainment for millions of readers. Since the 5 and 6th century, the famous wizards, such as the legend of Arthur, wrote an article. In the 21st century, young wizard Harry Potter. When he sold approximately 450 million copies on his book series (cut By June 2011), it becomes a global entertainment phenomenon reading, enters the list of historical bestselles. [126] [127]\n\nStreet entertainment, street performances and \"street art\" have been used in the form of performing the public entertainment needs for centuries. [128] This is \"part of London's life inseparable\" and also created the early 19th century \"full of wonders and recreational\" cities. [129] Wandering artists and bard poets are part of this tradition. Until now, there is still a street performance in the annual street art festival celebration. [130]\n\nThere are three basic forms of contemporary street performances. The first kind is called \"round\". It often gathers a group of people's performances, and performances usually have open curtains and closing ceremonies, bringing together street artists, \u5080\u5121, magicians, comediants, acrobats, juggling actors, and even musicians. This type of performance may be one of the most profitable performances, because there are more viewers may have fun from the performance, so there will be a bigger amount of gift. A good street artist controls the crowd, so that the order of the sidewalk is not affected. The second form, \"bard\", there is no clear start or end. Usually, street artists will create a foreign atmosphere, usually use a singular instrument, while the audience may not stop listening or gathering to watch. But sometimes the tourists will incur a large-scale onlookers. The third form is \"station\", mainly in restaurants, bars, pubs, and cafes. This type of performance occasionally uses a public transport station as a performance site.\n\nThe cruise is usually held for a variety of purposes. Regardless of the cruise atmosphere, it is a public activity designed to attract attention and activities, which will inevitably affect the traffic order, but it also brings entertainment value to people. The horse team and its modern variant, the team, is an example of a tour. Some people who viewed or participating in the parade may be specially present, while others attend are purely casual. Regardless of the atmosphere, why is the purpose, parade attracts the audience and entertain them. Occasionally, the parade will happen in the temporary planned place (such as 5 in the ceremony), the audience is mainly sports audience, while the global audience can watch live broadcast.\n\n\"Kaixuan\" is one of the earliest paradis. At the triumphant ceremony, people show the shocking large number of foreign treasures and trophy bringing by the Roman generals from the victory. Everyone celebrates their victory; people will also show the conquered people and the nation to show themselves. The glory of victory. In the first 46th AD, Yulius Caesa chooses to hold a grand ceremony in the different days of this year to celebrate our four victories, and each ceremony can often grow up to one month [131]. In Europe, from the Middle Ages to Baroque Art, people welcome the official visit of a city, during the city streets, and various performances and exhibitions in various corners of the city. The annual London Mayor Parade (English: Lord Mayor's Show) is also an example of urban parade from the Middle Ages.\n\nMany religious festivals contain a yearly-forward recreational event under its serious connotation, such as the Holy Week Parade (English: Holy Week Process), which is also characterized by catching people and enjoying joy. Indian Houli Festival. Sometimes some traditional religious rituals have evolved for people's daily recreational activities, such as the Savior of Venice and the Salvation Dynasty (English: Festa Del Redentore). However, there is such as Christian Sheng Yama, Islamic Dynasties and Hindu Taoist Pilgrims may be a street demonstration show for outsiders, and for participants, the opposite is true, it belongs to its personal Spiritual tour, can't be called its entertainment. Therefore, the relationship between the audience and participants of such activities is completely different relative to the general entertainment. Taking the entertainment in the big pot is an example.\n\nCruises usually have gorgeous colorful performances to attract people's attention (7, 10). Sometimes there are commemorative activities (5, 8) or celebrations (1, 4, 6, 8, 9). Sometimes there will be serious main purposes, such as parade (1, 2, 5) of the military background (1, 2, 5) and even some of them have deterrent; there are some paragraphs of religious backgrounds, audiences can participate in some roles (6, 7, 10) ). Some activities have the latest technology elements, the ornamental distance is far (9), which may still have strong appeal to outsider and bystanders, and can be entertaining.\n\nSince the 17th century, fireworks have been part of many public entertainment and become the main characteristics of major celebrations, and have been welcoming. The gunpowder was originally used in ancient China, and ancient Europe was used in military use. The fireworks are most popular in the 18th century. At that time, people often pay high compensation for people with fireworks manufacturing, especially the Italians who were summoned to other countries due to manufacturing skills. [133] [134]\n\nFireworks and dramas are an important performance link in the court. Sudden noise, smoke symbolizes the brilliance of power, this kind of emotion thinks of his sovereignty, his prestige, and in his strength There is an irreplaceable sense of glory: \"A fear of others to show his glory, birthday, name day, wedding day, can come to provide others to celebrate the opportunity to celebrate the\" [135] Celebrating the Austrian throne inheritance war A fireworks ended were a fireworks that were \"famous\" in history, and the performance triggered a fire; [136] But the Han Del Torn \"Royal Fireworks\" for the accompaniment also became famous for the performance. In addition to the role of military victory, court performances, and individual celebrations, fireworks are also used in some religious ceremonies. For example, in Hindu History Poetry, \"Medica\", \"Dashavatara Tour\" in the Dashavatara Tour in the Temple, in the song and dance and fireworks \"[137].\n\nThe \"flame, \u9739\u96f3, and smoke\" of fireworks are still an important part of public celebrations and entertainment activities. For example, the fireworks show is one of the necessary sections of the world to celebrate the millennium: When the bell rings in the middle of the night, the new millennium comes, as the time zone across the local area, people use fireworks performances and open-air pairs to welcome New year arrival. Carefully organized a well-planned fireworks performance meets the world's all over the world, such as Sydney Harbor Bridge, Giza Pyramid, Athens, Moscow Red Square, Roman Vatican City, Berlin Brandenburg, Paris Eiffel Tower, London Large Warm building.\n\nSports is always a way in people's entertainment. Different from athletes, sports competitive viewers are often referred to as audiences. With the improvement of stadium conditions, the design of the audience and the emergence of live broadcasts, the scale of sports audiences is more and more, and the ornamental movement is also more popular. The world's most popular two sports are football and crickets, and their international competition International Football Association World Cup and cricket counterparts are widely sought after. In addition to direct participating athletes participating in the competition, sports competition is a major entertainment project in millions of viewers around the world. [138] The global charm of the charm bicycle race is a lasting competitive sports event. It is unusual to other competitive sports. It is not in the stadium, but in the country game. [139]\n\nIn addition to the world's attractive and competitive sports, there are Olympic Games. Its entertainment value also involves the national and its sports culture. For example, in American baseball and basketball is a popular entertainment form, Bhutan's national sports is archery, and New Zealand Dan's football is full, and in Iran is free wrestling. The pest to Japan contains a ritual element derived from a long history. [140] Sometimes, such as International Running Group Hash House Harriers, participants bring their integration and entertainment. And as a viewer's participation is large, its sociality is stronger than competitive.\n\nA event has gradually become moved, and it has evolved into an entertainment activity that is also affected by local climate and conditions. For example, modern sports surfing and Hawaii are associated, while skiing is more likely to develop in Scandinavia. Although these sports entertainment is widely spread in the world, the origin of the country is still known in the event. The climate can be created, and the Ice hockey in Canada is adapted to the climate.\n\nThe market and exhibitions have a long history. The market is often used to show the treasure, creative and exchange of goods. It is also existed while providing specific entertainment projects. [141] Whether it is in the Mediterranean market or in a small shop, \"Shopping can always provide some form of pleasure, let people stay away from everyday life.\" [142] However, in the modern world, \"marketing means become New Entertainment Form: Rotate the glowing sign, heavy music, ..., big screen, interactive computer booth, daytimetric day, ... cafe. \"[142]\n\nIn the nineteenth century, art, manufacturing, and commercial exhibitions have become international behaviors. They are not only popular, but also affect international concepts. For example, in 1878 Paris Expo (English: Exposition Universe (1878)) promotes international cooperation in concept, innovation and standards. From 1851 in the 1900 Paris, \"More than 200 million visitors have stepped into London, Paris, Vienna, Philadelphia, Chicago World Expo, and other small exhibitions around the world [141] [143].\" Second After the Second World War, there is a far exceeding 5 million visit to the revolving door of the Expo [144]. As a magnificent, an entertainment form, \"from the building, to the globalization model, then to the fundamental human identity\" [144] \", these exhibitions have nothing. \"The rise of the market, special store, and the art museum [145]\" has contributed to this world that emerging consumption and entertainment industry.\n\nSome entertainment activities such as large festivals (whether religious festivals or cultural traditional festivals), concerts, clubs, delegates and celebrations involve a lot of people. Starting from the earliest era, the people in the entertainment venues will face danger, especially when entertainment and consumer alcohol. For example, ancient Greeks have a wine (English: Dionysian MySteries), and Romans have pesticides. The consequences of excessive and people may lead to violation of social behavior, sometimes even cause injury or even death, such as at Altamont's free concert, an unexpected outdoor rock music festival. The serious things happened by nightclubs include casualties caused by stepping accidents; terrorist attacks, such as Balinese bombings for the night club; fire require special attention. After the fire in Rhode Island, the survey conducted in the United States showed that the lessons learned from early incidents (such as Cocoanut Grove Fire (English: Cocoanut Grove Fire) did not necessarily lead to continuous effectiveness. Change [146]. The efforts to prevent such events include appointing professionals, such as Misto, English: Lord of misrule, or staff in modern times, and controlling the work of people in crowds; and continuously improve the relevant standards such as construction safety. Tourism now believes that the safety protection of the entertainment venue is an important management work [147].\n\nAlthough national heads, rulers and powerful people can always provide them with entertainment costs, and in many cases, they will usually entertain or participate in on-site performances. The technical development of the 20th century means that the production of entertainment products can be independent from the audience, and the entertainment industry is packaged in commercial form. [148] [149] The industry related to the entertainment industry is called the entertainment industry, and the industry relies on business model to make, sell, spread. Or use other ways, even cover all types of performances [150]. The industry has become very complex, so that its economics become an independent field of academic research [151].\n\nThe film industry is part of the entertainment industry, including the Hollywood and Bollywood movie industry, as well as all of the British cinemas and European cinema, including France, Germany, Spain, Italy, etc. The sex industry is another special part of the entertainment industry, and the same form and media on the basis of the business are applied to the development, propaganda and sales of sexual products.\n\nAmusement park provides tourists with a roller coaster, a train, water-playing motor game facility, and Diablo, English: Dark Rides, other activities and related attractions. The park usually divides different regions in accordance with the theme of the project and equipment. Sometimes the entire amusement park is based on one topic, such as some ocean world parks, these amusement parks are the theme of marine life.\n\nThe development of the entertainment industry has created more types of employment opportunities. Although the work like writers, musicians and composers is like previously, people who are engaged in this work may be hired by the company, but will not look for opportunities as they used to. The new position has appeared, such as the lighting engineer or special effects of the movie industry, and the waiter in the amusement park.\n\nThere are many awards (English: List of awards) in a variety of entertainment branches. For example, there are excellent music, games (including video games), comics, comatures, theaters, TV, movies, dances and magic. But the sports awards depend on objective results and skills, not entertainment value.\n\nThe special building is used as an entertainment venue to accept the audience, which has produced many famous, innovative buildings, the most famous of which is theater. [152] For ancient Greeks, \"The theater reflects the importance of architectural design, which focuses on social community, in terms of work in the theater architecture, and in the theater architecture The details of the details are particularly obvious. \"[153] The Romans have built an elliptical stadium known as a beet. In modern, some large entertainment buildings have brought a famous gas for their city and designers. For example, the World Heritage Sydney Opera House; London's entertainment area o\u2082, including the indoor stage, music club, cinema and exhibition space; Germany's Bayer Festival Theater is designed and built for some specific music works.\n\nThe venue design is considered a large number of audiences when the two most important buildings are export speed and security. The speed of the Qingfang is very important for comfort and safety, because a large number of people take a long time to disperse from the poor venue, thereby producing safety risks. The Hillsburg tragedy is an example, indicating that bad architectural design may cause the audience to die. Line and acoustic is also an important design consideration of most theaters.\n\nIn the 21st century, entertainment venues, especially sports venues, \"It is likely to become one of the main architectural types\" . However, they need \"new ways\" for design because they need to be \"complex entertainment center, multiple experience places, can be enjoyed in a variety of ways.\" So architects must now design \"there are two distinct features Such as sports and entertainment centers host the audience, as well as the viewing and listening needs of the remote audience as a sports and entertainment studio.\n\nArchitects who challenge or constructing the ultimate architects sometimes have entertaining buildings, they are exceeded by public and customer expectations, and have excellent aesthetic value. The Bilbao Guheheim Art Museum, such as Frank Gale, is a building, which is both a tourist resort, and an important worldwide museum. Other seemingly useful buildings are actually stupid, deliberately constructed for decoration, and have not been considering practicality.\n\nOn the other hand, some buildings are designed for entertainment, also trying to cover their functionality. In the tourism industry, there are some buildings that are newly refurbished, which is actually unable to use their use. They are only redesigned in order to add a cultural experience of tourists. Buildings, history, and even some sacred spaces will also be made to purchase cultural goods. Such a deliberately designed tourist attractions cutting buildings and its original historical phase, leading to \"the difference between authentic historical history and the entertainment venues or theme parks\" [154]. The example of this category has a Toledo Castle Reserve in the history of serious civil war, which is converted from the slave bunker to the Ghana Coast Castle, and the indigenous culture of Libya [155]. Some special build buildings in the amusement park often reflect the theme of the amusement park itself, it is difficult to show and play a corresponding function.\n\nBy the twentieth century, the development of electronic communication media will provide entertainment products to the Global Volkswagen. The technology enables people to see, hear and participate in all entertainment forms, such as stories, drama, music, dance, where they are.\n\nWith the continuous development of miniaturization, the evolution of data storage devices such as card tape or disc can also promote the rapid development of entertainment technology. The development of computerization and barcodes also makes the ticket purchase easier and is no longer limited to the region.\n\nIn the 1940s, the radio is an electronic medium that is home entertainment and information. [156] [157] [158] In the 1950s, as a new medium, TV was rapidly popular in a global scale, and gave people visual entertainment; with only black and white TV at the beginning, it was derived from color TV. [159] In the 1970s, video games appeared; then, people began to play video games on portable mobile devices; in the 1990s, large online games gradually became popular.\n\nThrough entertainment products, people have been able to personalize the traditional entertainment. Not only can you choose your own entertainment products, such as a song, a movie, or a game; more you can choose when and where you can experience it. \"The portable media player is gradually popular, and the computer has become a more mainstream film consumption route\", under the common action of these two factors, the mass changes in the viewing method have changed. [160]\n\nThe rise of e-entertainment has produced some significant effects, one of which is a rapid decline in records and storage. The reform of the electronic media has been very rapid. The TV is a good example. In the only generation of people, as a standard medium that receives entertainment products, TV from unknown novelty, gradually spreads into a universal medium, and finally gradually Alternative to other media. [161]\n\nHas been predicted: By 2011, more than 30 percent of the US family will have a Wii game console. Compared with the following, \"In 1953, there are also 30% family with a TV.\" [162] Some people believe that: until the second half of the 21st century, online entertainment will completely replace TV - but this is not the case.\n\nThe so-called \"digital revolution\" has built a multinational market. Everyone wants to keep up with the pace of the revolution, which also has a lot of trouble for government agencies, business institutions, various industries, and individuals. [163] [166] Since then, even the sports venues will compete with TV, through the audience ... provide a comfortable and safe environment, and almost uninterrupted audiovisual information and entertainment content \" Fight for the audience with the TV media. [167] But this transition is affected by some instability, which may include some public places on TV dependence, such as hospitals and sanosium, etc .; in these places, television is considered to be a patient and resident. Or missing entertainment, unless these places have network coverage, TV will not be replaced in such locations. At the same time, the inheritance of the \"professional\" of the entire society has never been broken, which indicates that traditional entertainment is still inherited. [168]\n\nIn the 1910s, digital records (English: Digital Recording) replaced the simulation record (English: analog recording), and all electronic entertainment forms have begun technology fusion. [169] This convergence brings challenges to the film industry. Previously, \"said a film is successful, depending on the performance of the box office in the next weekend. Now, in addition to the box office in theater, a film will also pass a series of other issues, such as DVD, pay TV , Fiber video point is broadcast, in order to achieve its profits. \"[170] A shift in the movie industry is that some movies start to choose a video website as its own starting position. Media integration is more than just technical integration, but also the integration of culture, [171] is \"a decision to protect enterprise, policy institutions and other group benefits\". [160] This fusion leads to globalization and cultural imperialism in the cultural level [172].\n\nThere are also fans culture and interactive stories to tell, cross-media production, and have spawned a series of new trading models. [173] \"Today's audience can receive audio-visual signals, such as ground TV, satellite TV, cable TV, and Internet\", which also affect entertainment revenue, taking the stadium as an example, modern stadium needs Design considerations, how to make the audience and TV viewers can interact to the sports events through a variety of different ways, and in all, the audience can \"watch the wonderful return, view score data\", \"order tickets, purchase derivative products\" Almost \"no stay at night, you can get the resource information of the stadium\". [174]\n\nThe emergence of TV has changed the cost of entertainment products, enriches the content of entertainment products. The quality of entertainment products and its communication methods have also changed. Similarly, the integration of online entertainment has also brought similar changes. For example, in different commercial production, some content products today are customized according to user needs, these \"network audience leads to the recession of program production\". [175] Individuals and companies can spread their own content products on the film sharing website; whether individual independent creation, or the company's commercial production, these entertainment content are accepted and viewed equally.\n\nWith the development of technology, people's demand for entertainment products is increasing, and the speed of the entertainment industry has also accelerated. At the same time, some contents of entertainment have kept stable relatively stable; whether it is story, music, drama, dance, or game, these entertainment forms are inherently different in the form of entertainment in the past few centuries. Travel is a travel tour. It refers to the industry of leisure facilities and services for passengers [1]. It is a complicated social phenomenon involving political, economic, cultural, historical, geographical, legal, etc. Tourism is also a kind of leisure and entertainment activity, which is characterized by sessile and temporary. In general, tourism has two different levels of tourism and travel, and the former is short, the experience is shallow; the latter is vice versa.\n\nTourists are called passengers, tourists.\nWhen traveling to group, the common travelers are called the same group.\nFree travel passengers, also known as backpackers.\n\nTravel is a travel tour.\n\nDifferent from the concept of travel.\n\nIt is a complicated social phenomenon, and tourism should involve social facilities such as politics, law, economy, culture, history, geography.

At the 1980 meeting of the World Tourism Organization, the Manila declaration believes that tourism is a necessary activity in national life, because it directly affects social, cultural, education, and economic fields.\n\nThe tourism industry can earn a lot of income by providing tourists and services (English: Goods and services), which accounts for 30% of world service trade, and 6% of overall goods and service export trade. At the same time, it also provides the employment opportunity for the third industry related to it.\n\nService industry benefited from tourism includes transportation industry (aviation, cruise ships, rail trains, taxi), hotel industry (accommodation, resort), entertainment venues (amusement park, restaurant, casino, shopping mall, music performance site (English) : Music venue), theater). Of course, there are also items sold to tourists including souvenirs.\n\nIn ancient times, local tourism leisure outside of a person is limited to the wealthy class. They will occasionally go far away, enjoy the magnificent architecture and art, learn the new language, experience new culture, taste different cuisine. The earliest tourism can be traced back to the King Hurgun, although the king is in order to build a road and build a station, providing other travelers to provide convenience [3]. The earliest leisure tourism can be traced back to the ancient Egypt of 1500 BC [4]. During the Roman Republic, the rich is popular to Baya. This place is a spa and seaside vacation. Sannias Writing \"Greece Description\" in the 2nd Century Bive. In ancient China, Confucius spends 14 years around the country, arrived at Taishan [5], with Confucius \"Deng Dongshan and Xiaolu, Deng Taishan, Xiaoxiao\".\n\nIn the Middle Ages, Christian Pilgrimage and Buddhism have pilgrimage traditions. Joe's Canterbury story collection and Wu Chengn's Journey, respectively, the classics of English literature and Chinese literature.\n\nThe Song Dynasty in the 10th century has emerged, there are some tourist writers, Su Shi, Fan Chengda. Ming Dynasty has Xu Xiake. Italy's Petritrick wrote travels in 1336, I wrote this trip, but criticized him lack curiosity. Burgundy Duke Poet Michault Taillevent (French: Michault Taillevent) wrote terror memoirs after visiting the Julant 1430 [6].\n\nModern tourism can be traced back to Zhuangwang, refers to the young people in the European upper class to Europe (mainly Germany and Italy). In 1624, Prince Poland Wadishvawvi has conducted travel across Europe, which is customary habits in the Polish aristocrats at that time [7]. He visited the current Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and was admitted to the Spanish army, France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Czech Republic, Siege of Breda (1624). This is an education tour [8], one of the results is to introduce Italian opera (English: polish Opera) into Poland Lithuania [9].\n\nThe tradition has been active to about 1660, until the emergence of large-scale rail transportation in the 1840, forming a standard travel stroke (English: Travel itinerary). Although this is primarily limited to the British aristocrat (English: british noibility) and rich rural nobles (English: landed gentry), Nordic's newcomers have similar trips, and from the middle of the 18th century, there are South America, the United States and other overseas young people join . The emergence of railways and steam boats makes tourism, and the middle class will also benefit, which there is Thomas Cook, and there is a proverb called \"Trip of Cook\" (meaningful to take a horse-speaking travel).\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, Zhuangyou became a symbol of the upper class, John Johnhim Wellkerman's hegemonic theory about classic culture was very popular with the European academic circles. Artists, writers, travelers (such as singing) affirmed Italy, France, Greece's hegemony in the traditional art field. For these reasons, the main destination of Zhuangyou is to go to these places.\n\nLeisure travel can be associated with the first industrial revolution in the UK, and people's leisure time increase [10]. At first, the beneficked group is the owner of the production of machines, oligarch, factory owners, traders. This also includes a new middle class [10]. Cutskin (English: Cox & Kings) founded in 1758 is the first formal travel company [11].\n\nThe industry has originated in the UK, which is reflected in many places. Vacation victory in the French C\u00f4zClass Coast, a famous beach poolway is called Anglo Street (meaning \"British walkway\"). There are many historical places in the European continent, and the Palace Hotel is named \"Bristol Hotel\", Kalton Hotel, Meiqi Hotel, which reflects the dominance of the UK.\n\nThomas Cook (English: Thomas Cook) is the first batch of travel business. On July 5, 1841, Cook Arrangement Railway Company received each passenger 1 command, including train tickets and meals on the trip.\n\nIn 1855, Cook launched the first foreigners, from Leicester to add and went to the World Expo, and the following year launched European big way [12].

In English, sports competition (Game) is also a game, and sports is also evolved from the game. The game is an organized play, usually in entertainment, sometimes there is also an educational purpose [1]. The game is different from the work of the corresponding money remuneration, and it is also different from the art of presenting aesthetics or conceptual elements. However, the divide between each other is not necessarily clear, and the game and work like professional athletes may be integrated, and like jigsaw games will have ingredients for games and art.\n\nThe main ingredients of the game have purpose, rules, challenges and interactions. Games generally have psychological or physical stimulation, many games can cultivate relevant techniques, organic, educational, simulative or psychological significance.\n\nFrom the Jiyuan 2600 [2] [3], the game is part of human experience, appearing in all cultures, like the Urrude, Senet and playful chess are the historic related long-standing games [ 4].\n\nLudwig Vitgenstein may be the first philosopher trying to define under the game, in his book \"Philosophical Research\" [, Vitgenstein proposes several elements, like playing, rules and Competition, but these are unable to define the game. Vitgenstein believes that humans use \"games\" to call many different activities. However, with the presentation of the game definition, the present philosopher believes that Vitgenstein is not the final conclusion, like Thomas Hurka, think Bernard Suits is a good definition of the game.\n[6]\n\nFrench sociologist Roger Kelos (English: Roger Caillois) is active in the book \"Game and People\" (Les Jeux et Les Hommes) [7] defined the game:\n\nComputer game designer Chris Clais Claus (English: Chris Crawford (Game Designer) is the founder of \"Computer Game Design Journal\", trying to use a series of two-point definition game: [8]:\n\nThe game can be \"what is the player wants to do?\" Classification [8], generally referred to as gay, the main elements of the game also include props and rules.\n\nThe game often classifies the props needed when playing games (eg, a zoom (English: MiniaTures Game), ball, card, chessboard and chess pieces or computers. Like the area that is easy to get in leather, since there is history, the ball is popular, and the global ball game has football sports, basketball, football, baseball, tennis and volleyball. The props needed by other games will be different from the region. Like European standard gaming groups, chess, such as Western chess, can be seen from their chess and develop.\n\nSome games represent other things, representatives can represent chess pieces on the board, game money (English: play money) or other games, invisible things.\n\nLike a hide and seek, there is no need for special props, but its interaction is also related to the environment. If the environment is different, even if there is similar or even the same rule, it may become different games, such as the school's hide, hide, hide, and seek . The car used by the car is the same, and the difficulty in the car or the general road will be different.\n\nGames are often classified according to rules, and the rules may have changed or even change. When they change to a certain extent, they become a new game. For example, the baseball can be played with a general baseball, or it can be played with a weapon ball, or a baseball. However, if you agree, there is only three barriers, it turns another game. However, some games are characterized by changes in their rules, just even so, there will still be constant metamorphic rules.\n\nThe rules will determine the order of playing, the players' rights and obligations, and the player's purpose. Players' rights may include the use of resources or moving representatives. The general victory may be the first number of points to collect or represent detries (such as Cattan), with the most representatives at the end of the game. (For example, real estate tycons), or representatives of both parties have certain specific relationships (such as the death of Western chess).\n\nThe props and rules of the game will affect the game in different levels of skills, strategies and luck, and may be the above combination.\n\nGame Skills (English: Games Of Skill) includes skills, such as wrestling, tug, hopping houses, and shooting sports, including mental skills, such as Western Checkers and Western Chess. Strategy Games in Western Checkers, Western Chess, Indian Boucu, Go and Wicker Chess, usually need to cooperate with special equipment. Game game emphasizes its luck ingredients, like gambling games (, mahjong, roulette) and snake ladder, scissors, stone, cloth, etc., mostly need cards or dice.\n\nBut most of the games will use both techniques, strategies, and even all of the luck. For example, American football and baseball will use skills and strategies, while TiddlyWinks (English: Tiddlywinks), poker and real estate tycons are dominated by strategies and luck. Many chess version of the game will use skills, strategies and luck, and most of the luck ingredients of the game are smaller, like the Warring States State, Katan and Kakari and other strategic games.\n\nMany scholars have found that games not only exist in humans, but also have a lot of game behavior in many mammals. The game history is very long, but the study is carried out in modern times.\nThe study of the essence of the game is still developing, and there is currently no final understanding of conclusions.\nThe game theory mainly:\n\nGerman poets and dramatic Schiller proposed a game theory. This theory believes that \"human beings should be subject to mental and substances in life, lost ideals and freedom in these constrains. So people use the remaining spirit to create a free world, it is the game. This creation activity Produced in human beings.\n\nSchiller said: \"When people are full of people, he only gamously; only when people play, he is completely people.\"\n\nThe remaining energy is a game theory, which is proposed by the British philosopher Herbert Spino. He is a further supplement to Schiller's instinct.\n\nThis theory believes that \"human beings have completed the main tasks of maintaining and continuing life, there are remaining energy, this remaining energy vent is the game. The game itself does not have utilitarian purposes, the game process itself is the game the goal of\".\n\nGerman biologist Carl Garrus (English: Karl Groos) to the residual energy of the British philosopher Herbert Screws and Schiller's instinct said.\n\nThis theory believes that the game is not a purposeful activity, and the game is not associated with the actual life. The game is a preparation activity that faces life in the future. For example, the kitten grab minus is practicing the mouse, the little girl gives the doll, is practicing as a mother, the boy playing the game is exercising.\n\nFreud has also proposed a game's theory. He believes that the game is an alternative to being suppressed.\n\nThere are many games, and different types of games will be derived in different media, the number of items or participation in different types will be different. These include:\n\nHuman body (such as hands, feet) or use toy entertainment. More common, \"stone, scissors, cloth\", sometimes sports activities, and even martial arts programs are also treated as games. Commonly used toys have caches, balls, cold weapons, etc.\n\nTable games are used to describe any games playing on the table or plane, including layout games, paper strokes, card games, dice games, designers in the table in recent years have more and more action, sound, rhythm , Props, pictures, dolls, story background, or even art, film and television, music, dance and other materials to join the trend of the game, providing players or players more sensory stimuli and different experiences in the past, To enhance the fun and quality of the game.\n\nPlanning games are used to describe games that will draw graphic symbols on the plate as a record tool, which is to play games with chessboards and chess pieces, including common chess games, chess is one. The number of participants can be one person, two people, or even many people. Flying chess, Go, etc. are more common layamers.\n\nIt is used to describe games that will only have pen and blank sheets, including wellword chess, alone, you draw me guess (PICTIONARY) and crosswords, etc.\n\nAlso known as card games or card games, broadly use cards (cards) to conduct a total name. The narrow sense refers to the game of the playing card.\n\nAlso known as the collective game, the number of participants must be more than three. The game can be seen as an experimental study activity, helping the group to learn from the game, learn interpersonal skills and how to make the team to work. Participants and or the host may be some groups such as churches, teachers and students. Since the participants may have many, large spaces are usually required to play games, such as auditorium or school playground.\n\nIncluding TV games, computer games and carrier gaming machines, etc. Its features must use the display of the electronic device containing the display, see the game console.\n\nIn the game, players play a game in a virtual world in a particular scene. The role has different capabilities according to different game plots and statistics (such as health, power, strength, sensitivity, intelligence, etc.), and these attributes will change according to the game rules.\n\nAmong them, role playing games are divided into table role play games, electronic role play games and presence dynamic role playing games.\n\nPutting game, or puzzle game, intelligence game, puzzle game\n\nSuch games require players to use their wisdom to solve problems in the game to achieve the goal of the game.\n\nThe latest commercial game usually adds action elements, making the puzzle game can exercise the brain, hand, and eye coordination of the players through the game, and maintain intelligence and open thinking.\n\nReferred to as MOBA game, originated from the \"Warcraft III: Chaotic Treatment\" model called \"Remaining War\" (English: Defense of the Ancients), due to its changing game situation and multi-game factors welcome. Such games are multi-cooperation with teammates to achieve the purpose of defeating the hostile camp.\n\nCurrent relatively well-known Moba game with League of Legends, DOTA\n\nOther game types include outdoor games, fun play and mathematical games. Interest is an idle activity that humans do in regular time in order to meet the strong enthusiasm and self-enjoyment or joy of certain things, usually do not participate in these activities with money or work. Hobbies include collecting theme items and items, engage in creativity and artistic pursuit, engaged in sports, or engaged in other entertainment activities. Tools or equipment, equipment, and furniture refers to the equipment that can be convenient for people to complete, and its benefits can be mechanical or intelligent. Most of the tools are simple mechanical; for example, an iron bar can be used as a lever, the farther the force is left away, the greater the force of the lever transmission.\n\nThe philosopher thinks that only human beings will use tools, so they define people to understand animals using tools. It can be used to observe chimpanzees and other animals, especially primate, and certain birds (such as traffder) and sea otters. After that, philosophers believe that only human beings have the ability to make tools until the animal is observed that some birds and monkeys will also make tools. Most anthropologists believe that the use of tools is an important step in human evolution; humans develop with thumbs with other fingers to grasp tools, and intelligence advancement can help human use tools. Some studies have shown that the brain treats tools as part of the body extends [1].\n\nTools that are used to improve the strike effect in violent conflicts are called weapons. Most of the tools can be used as simple weapons, such as hammers, knives; also, people can also use weapons such as explosives as tools for mining, civil engineering and demolition.\n\nTools are very loved by children. Some toy tools are the pockets of real tools, such as toys and buckets playing in the sandy beach or Sha pool; other toy tools do not really function, such as a blunt plastic knife.\n\nIn computer science, the term is also used to assist people's work, such as computer-aided design.\n\nVarious tools have their specific functions, such as: Music, broad meaning, means any art composed of sound. The word English Music is from ancient Greek \u03bc\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae (Mousike), which means the art of Muses. The Chinese music is two words, Xu Shen, \"said words\" explain \"sound, sound. Born in the heart, there are festivals, the sound.\" Thinking that music and sound is different, the music needs to imagine through people Create.\n\nMusic can be divided into three processes created, played, listened to different cultures and society, have different understandings for music, and their importance, such as in West Africa, everyone is participant, people will not distinguish The identity of composers, players and listeners; but all human culture have music, that is, playing music is a phenomenon in all culturalities.\n\nThe main elements of music have sound, rhythm and tone. Music can be divided into different types, but each type is often ambiguous and controversial, and different types of concert emphasize or ignore certain music elements varying degrees. As for the sound, or the difference between the music and noise, there is no recognized standard, which is also different from culture and social background. Many of the performances of breakthrough or avant-gardid music were criticized as \"non-music\", such as Beethoven's bigger, and early jazz. However, many musicians in modern times do not agree with the traditional understanding, such as the 20th century American composer John Kaji thinks that any sound and silence are music.\n\nMusic can be descriptled with a score, based on score performance, but there are also many music types such as folk songs or jazz is the performance of the player. The music score can only describe the attributes of the sound or the skills required to play the performance, but cannot record the sound itself. Therefore, before the recording technology appears, enjoy the music must be listened on the spot, or participate in the performance. Traditionally enjoying music with specific places, from ancient palace, church, temple to today's concert hall, bar, etc. At the end of the 19th century, the inventive sound of the gramophone can record and copy, change the model of enjoying music; generally believe that the recording, communication technology and mass media are the main factors of pop music formation, from early album, music video and radio, to today The audio and video website or streaming platform is a pipeline that people touch music.\n\nPlaying music requires singing or musical instruments. The generalized instrument includes tools that can make sounds, and people have begun to make the original instrument in the stone era. Today's computers and many electronic music products can make music through MIDI.\n\nMusic is a skill that needs to be learned, and there are music classes in basic education in many countries, and some music colleges provide professional music education. Music is a history of scientific research music, including music theory and music history. In addition, national musical and cultures were studied from all over the end of the 19th century. The music industry also includes many-oriented: creators of music (composers and filling the wrong words), music players (music group music, singer or command), music recorders (including audio engineers), music activities preparators And the vendors of music resources (records or music).\n\nDifferent combinations of music elements have formed a unique personality of each music, making people understand their structures and expressions when listening to different music, and detect which national, regional, era and type music as much as possible. Each country is not the same as the official definition of music elements, but roughly all elements include:\n\nThe sound of different frequencies is issued at different times, form a melody; the sound of different frequencies is issued at the same time or in a very short period of time, forming a string. The speed of the templer, the regular strong shot and weak shots form the beat, the coherence between the notes is described.\n\nCommonly used pitch forms ranging and tunability; to enrich the fabric of music, you can use the actions and acousticization. The opposition is to make a plurality of different melodies lines, and the sound explore multiple chord continuous matching, both of which are relative.\n\nThere are three types of fabric of music. Monophony is the simplest music fabric, only a single melody line, only two factors of melody and rhythm. If there is a main melody that is dominated by different chords, it is the homophony. If there are more than two melodies independent of each other, it is a Polyphony.\n\nFinally, each musical instrument and each vocal have its own unique tone, different tone instruments combine music unique sound effects, emotions, and symbolic meaning; arrange the combination of these instruments called an attachment.\n\nMusic is a symbol, a sound symbol, and what is thinking about it. It is one of the carriers of people's ideas. Music is a purpose, there is connotation, which implies the author's life experience, ideological and feelings. The music is analyzed from sound waves between the noise and frequency constant pure tones, which can bring the emotions of beauty enjoyment and expression.\n\nMusic is a form of social behavior, through music people can exchange emotions and life experiences. This effect is most prominent in the song.\n\nIn ancient Chinese ancients, there is a perfect gift system. The monarch of the ancient sages will pass the 'Le', 'Rich' to return to the people's physical and mental and words and deeds, and reach the role of governance. Confucianism, \"Dale and Tiandi, the same section of the sky, the same section of the world\", people can also communicate through music and the heavens and the earth, thus getting wisdom to improve their physical and mental purification. Nowadie scientists study, classical music has a great advantage to the body and mind of the conditioner, especially Mozart's music, benefit to the brain of people, can also reduce the risk of epilepsy patients [1], so good music pair People will regulate the body and reduce the effects of the disease.\n\nThe ancient Greek philosophers Pythagora, interpreted the music in the expression of the \"number\".\n\nThe creation of ancient great musicians and the popularity of folk songs is basically produced by inspiration. Later scholars are studying these more years of music, gradually summarizing the theory, and future musicians will create under these theories.\n\nMusic theory proves which music can be accepted by most people and make people feel pleasing. Modern and combined with physical acoustic research results, the theory is constantly developing.\n\n\n\nThere are two main forms: the sound of vocal music and music music music, whether there are many combination of music or instruments, such as solo, chorus, singing, solo, concerto, symphony, etc. Both can also be mixed, vocal with musical instrument accompaniment, or mixed into vocals in instrumental symphony.\n\nVocal music is a music form of one or more singers, using instrument accompaniment or not, and vocal is the focus of the work. The music containing people, but the focus is not in it, is generally called the male music (such as the \"Planet Group\" of Gustav Hallste, there is no lyrics. Chorus without musical instruments is often called uncommon chors (A Cappella, also known as Akabara).\n\nFor vocal music, quite a multi-acoustic work (part or all) is to imitate other sounds or pure content abstractions, and use non-language syllables or noise, but the average person pays special attention to the use of lyrics. A small and lyrics that contain lyrics are often referred to as songs.\n\nVocal music may be the oldest music form, because it does not need any instruments, just people can. There is a form of vocalities in a variety of music culture. Language and music purposes are different, all have a common music factor.\n\nThe vocals are divided into the following sects of the following sectors of the following sectors:\n\nThe instrument is relative to vocal, full with instruments, without vocal or vocal music. The played instrument can include all kinds of stringed instruments, wood tube musical instruments, copper tube instruments and filling instruments, and some instruments also apply some people, and there is no lyrics just as an effect, but some composers sometimes join some people, such as Bendo The \"Ninth Symphony\" of Fen Writing is also added to the chorus \"Happy\", but it is correct to do most of the symphony, and it is less for vocal music.\n\nWestern music mainly refers to European music, and many musicians have been funded and protected, so many musicians have developed more perfect music theory. At present, the Western music theory has recognized the world's recognition and composing program in the world's music world in the world.\n\nThe pre-Qin period, the ritual system is given the function of maintaining social order. In Chinese traditional thinking, the relationship between music and human feelings is greatly attached to, especially Confucianism thinks that music has the role of huge nature, this is in the \"Book of Songs\", \"Rites, Music\", \"Xunzi \u00b7 The music articles \",\" Historical Records \u00b7 Le Book \"and other works can be learned. Even the \"Lemrao\" in the thirteen has made more deeper instructions on music, and they have been lost.\n\nChina is wide in China, a wide variety of people, and the folk music materials in all parts are very rich. Modern China has absorbed the theory of Western music to organize ancient literature and folk music, preparing the tracks of national musical instruments, making Chinese music a great development.\n\nChina's ancient musicians are not high. There is no effective protection of music, so although it has been invented, many famous works have not been able to circulate, and most of the works that have been circulated are relying on folk artists. Holiday education. On the other hand, the ancient large number of people bureaucrats itself is proficient in music, such as Confucius, Zhou Yu, Ruan Ji, Su Shi, etc. are famous.\n\nChinese music classification\n\nMusic is developed by the evolution of humans since humans, so there are unique music forms and musical instruments around the world. Although music theoretical development around the world is not balanced, but the music style is different. Development path. Modern music has absorbed the musicia materials around the world, and the music around the world has its own contribution to the development of world music.\n\nPop music (different):\n\n\n\nGzuz and Bonez MC\n\nZara larsson\n\nTiesto\n\nInna\n\nS\u0142awomir\n\nTimati\n\nThe pop music developed after the mid-20 century violates the theory of classical music, absorbed the local music ingredients around the world, emphasizing the participation of the masses, and the audience is not quietly listening to the listener of music, but a warm participator. . Music returns to the form of the original car dance dance, which can mobilize people's emotions, so they are warmly welcomed by young people, breaking the regional, nation, and national boundaries, wide popular in the world.\n\nMusic for composer creation can spread several media; the most traditional is one of the live experiences as one of the audience or players. On-site music can also be broadcast through radio, TV or Internet. Some musical styles are pronounced to perform, some focus on generating recording and then used for later reverb synthesis, which is never \"live\". On-site performance style music often uses editing and separation functions to produce results that sound \"better\" than actual performances.\n\nBecause of the introduction of protective players, composers, publishers and producers, such as the United States's 1992 Home Recording Act, and Berne specifications, recording, British British BERNE, recordings for protecting literature and artworks. And on-site performances have also become more vary from computer, equipment, and Internet to be used in the form of Music-on-Demand.\n\nIn many cultures, some music performances and listening have no great difference, because everyone is in a group in a group in some way in some way. In industrialized countries, through recording, such as listening to music recording or watching music recording, it has become the form of the most common feelings of live performances, which is roughly in the middle of the 20th century.\n\nSometimes, the live performance has adopted a pre-recorded sound. For example, DJ can use a record to make a wiper effect, while some of the 20th century works are carried out simultaneously with solo or solo performance and prefabricated tape music. Computers and or multi-key instruments can be used to program generation and playing MIDI music. The audience can also become a performance by karaoke, this form is created for the Japanese, which uses video and no sound track, so the performance can add their own voice.\n\nMusic is an important part of primary education. It is an effective tool for cultivating children's artistic literacy. It is generally starting from kindergarten music education around the world. Ancient China regards music as one of the six art talents that the Scholars should have, so that China's formal music education has continued until the end of nine-year compulsory education, that is, graduated from junior high school. Ordinary high school is generally open.\n\nAs a professional music personnel, it is generally necessary to go through special higher music education, but most of them are engaged in professional higher education, most of them have relying on their own talents and self-learning.\n\n[Edit in Wiki Data] Dance is one of the eight art [1], is the sports expressions of the human body of the body as the body of the body \"Missing\" in the three-degree space, generally have a music accompaniment, and the artistic form of the main manifestation means . It generally uses music, also with other props. Dance itself has diverse social significance, including sports, social / seeking, sacrifices, etiquette, etc.\n\nBefore the origin of human civilization, dance is very important in rituals, etiquette, celebrations and entertainment. Archaeologies offer traces of dance, such as 9,000 years ago, the rocky murals of Bindhka, India and 3300 egyptian tomb. Painting dance characters drawn 3300 BC.\n\nChina has already had dance before five thousand years, [2] is generated in slave society [3], there is a certain feature of development to Qin Han: long sleeve, waist, elegant, skillful, just fucked. [3] The big exchange of Chinese and foreign music dances since the Wei and Jin Dynasties and the emphasis on the Tang Dynasty, the emergence of dancers such as Yang Guifei, so that Chinese performance dance is unprecedronized. [3]\n\nAfter Song Yuan Mingqing, China's performance dance gradually integrated into opera, became a drama dance of the shape, expressing emotions, and showing the plot.\n\nAfter the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the dance as an independent theater is increasingly perfect and mature. [2]\n\nEvery dance has its theme, and this topic also has to develop and change. This is very similar to the situation of music. [4]\n\nChina's dance has a significant character, that is, \"composition\" symmetry, the people on the left do a posture, and the people on the right also make a corresponding posture. The three elements of the dance refers to the expression (not only the expression of the face, is a full body expression), rhythm and composition. The expression and rhythm of Chinese dance have its own characteristics, but the most significant characteristic is composition. This composition is called \"Symmetric Balance\" in the dance. [4]\n\nAccording to the function, use of the dance, it can be divided into two categories of \"practical dance\" (self-entertainment) and \"performance dance\" (entertainment); for each category, according to the \"time\" is divided into traditional and popular, totaling four categories;\nThen you can subdue down, but no matter that classification method, the boundaries have blurred, and the classification is represented below.\n\nWith the purpose of fitness, pleasure, puzzle, and performance, often participants is the dancer and the audience, but not the audience.\n\nFor performance or appreciation, participants are divided into performanceters and audiences.\n\n[Edit in Wiki Data] Movies (English: Movie), also called movies (English: film), feature sports / moving pictures (English: motion / moving pictures), is a visual artwork, used to simulate thinking by using dynamic images. Story, perception, feeling, beauty or atmosphere experience. These images are usually accompanied by sound, fewer sensory stimulation. [1]\n\nThe continuous picture in the movie is done by a frame of frame of frame, as for the feeling of motion in the movie, because people will cause a series of still pictures because of the vision of the flying phenomen. The illusion. Conventional understanding of motion perception in the film is because the visual is suspended, so that the image will remain in the eye to retain \"video\" about one tenth of seconds. Therefore, the brain feels that the image is \"sports\". However, in the 1916 Psychologist Hugo M\u00fcnsterberg's \"Movie: A Psychology Research\" in the Third Chapter, \"Deep Sense and Sense\", Hugo Minster Berg proves that the appearance movement is never the result of the image retention (ie, the visionary), but (but not just) a perception of the continuous phase of the movement.\n\nMovie production itself is an art is also an industry (English: Film industry). The movie can be made by the movie camera, and the drawing can also be used to draw the drawing and then take pictures, and even the computer imaging and computer animation can be used. All of the above techniques can be utilized in the movie. Other visual effects. In the early days of the development of film technology, there are various screening speeds, but current movies are mostly twenty-four image of the twenty-four image [2].\n\nLouis Prince on October 14, 1888, using an improved version of the single-lens camera (ie MKII) to shoot the film \"Langdehai Garden Scene\". His Hanslet in Leeds, Hansle, Hansle, and Hitlli Located in Landeham's home - Oakwood Farm exhibited him the first movie.\n\nMovies have become the seventh art, which is the Italian poet and film pioneers Joso Kanu Du (Ricciotto Canudo), he is a \"birthday of the sixth art\" published in 1911 (Birth of The 6th Art), putting the movie behind the architecture, sculpture, painting, music, and poem, and he later joined the dance before the movie, so the movie became seventh art [3]. There are also some statements that will be in the film before the film has been in the film, and the movie will become the eighth art.\n\nToday, many movies still use photographers that can record images on the film. After the film is rinsed, use the projector to run the film. The projector can emit light, through the film, so the image is displayed on the screen. Since the inventions of sound movies, most movies have sound movies. Many movies have been taken with a digital video camera, and when the show can be used, you can use the digitizer to transfer the digital image to the traditional film. This method avoids distortion of the film for a long time.\n\nIn 1895, \"Train Entering\" is a black and white silent document made by the Lumie Brother. This record train arrives at the La Ciott station, which is taken on the platform. The whole length of fifty seconds, describing the steam train into the bus, gradually enter the station from the distance. In the same year, the Lumi Brothers also made the \"departure factory\", and a movie that truly actor's performance appeared, photographing the scene at the time.\n\nEarly movies are \"no sound movies\". However, the film publisher finds that there is a commentator to describe the story when playing a movie, and makes it more attracting the audience more. After a few years, the played movie will be attached to the subtitles so that you can show what he said when the actor is \"speaking\". This makes the coupons of the appreciation.\n\nIn fact, the cinema boss often replaces the judge, please accompaniment when the movie is shown, if the cinema has the corresponding instrument, it is usually a pianist or organ. The accompaniment music should always match the movie's plot.\n\nLater, the advancement of technology allows the manufacturer to create a track synchronized with the movie picture, so that the movie has entered a sound period. The first part of the history is the \"Jazz Singer\" (1927) [8], and the first 100% sound film is \"New York lights\". The recording of the track can be separated from the shooting movie, but the real movie track record, many parts are simultaneous with the shooting screen. After the inventions of the sound movie, the silent movie and the musicians in the cinema quickly tired.\n\nAn important step in movie development is that color movies introduced into the market around 1930, and the world's first recognized color movie is \"\u534e \u4e16\u754c\". In the process of replacing black and white movies in color movies, it is a gradual transformation process. With the improvement of color technology, more colorful movies can be said that there is basically no black and white movies. In addition to individual exceptions, such as Staton's movie \"Schindler's list\", former Soviet movie \"Sentiment here\", 2011 French film \"big artist\" and 2013 Polish movie \"dependent choice \"Wait. This is usually spent on art or drama, deliberately shoots black and white movies.\n\nAt the beginning of the film, the special effect lens of the movie is combined with each technique. To present, the computer has been applied to the film production, and some of the lens actors only need to sit on the special chair, do some expressions and moves, and the background and plots that appear on the screen are simply imaginable, because of the computer Making the work of editing the film replaces a cumbersome step, making the final copy quality and the products that have also been in the same day.\n\nThe purpose of the film theory is to study, develop concise and systematic concepts with movies. The concept of movie is from the form of art origin \"The Birth of the Sixth Art\" of Jono Canu Du (English: Ricciotto Canudo). Rudolf Anheim, Bella Braz and the formalist film theory (English: Formalist Film Theory) stressed the different movies and reality, so it can be considered art. However, Andre Pakan opposed this theory, and believed that the essence of film aesthetics was in the ability to replicate reality, not part of its and reality, which produced realism theory (REALIST THEORY). More recently analyzed is driven by the spiritual analysis of Jacoblaga and the theoretical theory of Fudi South Dude Saussian symbolics, therefore, there is a mental analysis film theory (English: psychoanalytic film theory), structureist movie Theory (English: structuralist film theory), femaleism film theory, etc. On the other hand, it is affected by Ludwig Vitgenstein, from the analysis of philosophical tradition, tried to clarify the misunderstanding of theoretical research, so the analysis of film vocabulary, and its form of life (English: Connectivity between form of life (philosophy)).\n\nMovies have the language it uses. James Monaco (English: James Monaco) has written a classic article in a movie theory. The title is \"How to\" Read \"A Film), which is mentioned. Director Ingma Birman has said a famous word: \"For me, Andre Tarkovsky is the greatest movie director. He invented a\" new language \", loyal to the movie. The essence. An example of this language is a series of screens, one of which is an actor on the left side of the screen, and another picture is an actor on the right side of the screen. The audience can understand this language, know that this represents these two people's dialogue . This describes another movie theory 180 degree rule (English: 180-degree rule), using visual combinations and appropriate clips, movies can make the audience seem to be in the scene and watch the rigid between the protagonist. Classic Hollywood movies include this narrative theory, because in the classic period of the movie, the use of this one has been reversed in Hollywood. Another movie language is to shoot the lens, the picture is silent, then the lens is switched to another actor, which represents another actor, which represents the actor's case, and the movie describes some of the earlier time. thing.\n\nMovie reviews (film reviews) are the analysis of the film and assessment. In general, the film review will be divided into two categories: the academic film reviews proposed by film researchers, as well as magazine movies that are often seen in newspapers, magazines or other media.\n\nMost film reviews on newspapers, magazines and broadcast media will look at many newly released movies. Generally, each piece will only take a look at once, and one day only look at one to two pieces, there is enough time to write movie comments. The film review has a great impact on the movie itself, especially for a movie of a particular film. Generally, the popular taste of the moving film, a horror film, the box office of the comedy film is not too much affected by film comments. The main content of the movie comment is the summary of the plot and the description of the movie. This is also why most people decide whether to see a specific movie. For some classic movies (such as drama films), film comments are quite large, and bad movie comments may destroy a movie and causing economic losses of film companies.\n\nWhether the film review affects the presentation of the box office is still the issue of controversial. Some people think because of movie marketing (English: film promotion) so fierce, adequate funds, film reviewers are difficult to affect movies. However, some heavy programs are not worth worthwhile, and the box office is very poor. There are also some independent production or small cost marketing movies because of the praise of the film review, so in some cases, the film review may still Will affect box office. Some people notice that the positive comments of the film review will let the public noticed some more than well-known films. Relatively, some film companies may not arrange the film review will destroy the impression of film reviews without arranging their confidence in film reviews. However, this will have a counter-effect, and the film reviewers are quite smart. In this case, the masses can be not worth seeing, and often movies are still as good as the film review is expected.\n\nThe method of movie production is different from the content that the film wants to expresses, as well as the device presenting the content. The drain tablets only need to have a series of patterns on the paper roll. The simplest way of making a movie is a person plus a movie camera (which can not bring a movie camera, Moth of Mothlight (English: MothLight)), or thousand actors, temporary actors in Stan Brahag, 1963 And the crew and many props and equipment.\n\nAlmost every movie will need a process of concept, planning, taking film, modification, and distribution. In the production cycle of typical Hollywood movies, there will be the following main steps.\n\nGeneral a movie will take three years, the first year of the first year of development, the second year is the early production and film production, the third year is the post-production and movie release.\n\nMovie release (English: Film Distribution) means that the audience can see the process of movie. It is generally performed by a dedicated film distribution company (English: Film Distributor), they will determine the marketing strategy of the movie, the film will be exhibited or available for viewing, and the decision movie is released (English: film release) time. In addition to the viewing of the movie theater, the film is placed on the consegran, or it is a TV program through the broadcast.\n\nOther ways of distribution include personal purchase or a VHS, DVD, or Blu-ray disc of a mobile phone, is downloaded on the Internet. The drama (English: DRAMA) is an example of an actor to perform a story or situation with a conversation, singing or action. The drama has four elements, including \"actors\", \"story (situation)\", \"stage (performance site)\" and \"audience\". \"Actor\" is the most important element in all four. He is the spokesperson of the role. The ability to play, the drama is the biggest difference between the drama and other art is to play, through the actor's play, the role in the script is only Stretch, if the actor's play is abandoned, then the show is no longer a drama.\n\nEven in animations, puppet play, shadow play, no actors appeared in the play, actors are just a place where they are hidden outside the visual visitors.\n\nDrama has a variety of performance forms, common include dramas, opera, dance, musical, puppet play, etc. Due to the difference in cultural background, the form of drama in different cultures often has unique traditions, such as Western drama, Chinese opera, Indian Vananats, Japanese energy, singing and kora, and so on.\n\nThe origin of the drama is not available, and there are currently a variety of hypothesis. The more mainstream views are two: a witchcraft ceremony for the original religion. For example, in the ancient Chinese, \"Witch\", \"Dance\", \"Wu\" three characters may homologous (the ancient Chinese is: / * mA /, / * mA\u0294 /, / * ma\u0294 /). It is likely to be a conjunction with a witchcraft activity that begging the battle, that is, the original form of the drama. Another imaginary song and dance performance when labor or celebration, this statement is that ancient Greek drama is considered to originate from the gods.\n\nThe concept of modern drama emphasizes all the performances of all performance elements to achieve a comprehensive art effect. Performance elements include an actor, stage, props, lighting, sound, clothing, makeup, and script, director, etc., also include the relationship between the performance and the interaction of the stage (generally referred to as \"viewing\").\n\nLiterary drama concept refers to the script created by the drama performance, or a script.\n\nThe word source of Chinese drama comes from the \"Nanyu North Drama\", the drama is a drama, the drama is a scorpion, which is a political situation in China and the northern part of the South. Different performance arts, the use of the two is the usage of the future.\n\nThe words in the world and the word \"drama\" in the world are not. For example, in addition to the drama in the Indian language, there is also a dance, sports competition. However, the words related to the \"drama\" in the world are almost similar to the \"game\", such as in English, will be called a Play (usually referred to as a drama with a script). \"Drama\" in Chinese, also has the meaning of \"game\".\n\nThe three ancient drama culture in the world, including the tragedy and comedy in Greece, the Vasantan and Chinese opera in India.\n\nThe dawn of the Western drama is generally considered to be ancient Greek tragedy, and ancient Greek tragedy is from the ancient Greek Athens City. In the 5th century BC, at the celebration ceremony of Dai Ourius, held a drama game. . In the ceremonies, people play Dai Oiius, sing \"Dai Shen\", jump \"Sheep Dance\" (sheep is an animal representing Dai Ouxi). The ancient Greek tragedy is a poem, rigorous and elegant, and solemn. There is a song along the performance, and historical real shows that the song is presented in the actor. Regarding this origin, you can also refer to the early philosophical book \"The birth of the tragedy\" in the early philosophy of philosophy.\n\nFive of the five ancient Greek drama writers are very famous. Although their works have only a small part, they remain until today. Escoss's historical tragedy \"Persians\" is the oldest drama, which has a prize in the city's wine in 472 BC, but Escoss has spent more than 25 years ago. [2].\n\nTragedy plays present the four-song way of the drama, usually include three tragedy and a sheep drama. The comedy was officially affirmed from 487 to 486 BC. Even the annihilant writer is in the city of wine (decreased during the War of Bolonnes), it will provide a single comedy. The ancient Greek comedy is divided into \"Old Comedy\" (5th century BC), \"The Comedy of the Middle Comed\" (4th century BC) and \"New Comedy\" (2th century BC).\n\nAthens' drama culture can be divided into three style: tragedy, comedy, and Samat drama.\n\n(1) Tragedy: Exploring the issue of religion, philosophical, and the gods of the gods. Reference: Sophocles \"\u5e15 \u5e15 \u738b\" [3].\n\n(2) Comedy: The old Tourist Opera in the classical period is more important in contemporary society, time affairs and literature, philosophical trend. Reference: Aristophanes \"Lisi Cui\". The new comedy in the Greek period is more realistic, with romantic family entanglement as the subject. Reference: Menander \"The old man of bad temper\" [3]\n\n(3) Samat drama: The aim of the previously staged tragedy or mythical story, aimed at taunting the aristocrat or god of the protagonist through the Sattok team. [3]\n\nThe Greek drama continues to perform throughout the Roman period, marking the beginning of regular Roman drama in the first 240 BC. The ancient Roman time recreational event is quite rich, in addition to the official supported formal play and shape short Yatra, there is also a juggling, racing, horse racing, water war, beast fight ... and I have an entertainment competition that vote for sensory stimulation. On the one hand, these boat, the \u81bb activities reflect the taste of the ancient Rome audience, and on the one hand, it also affects the style of formal drama.\n\nIn ancient Rome, through the cancellation of the song and dance team, scattered the music to the full drama, and \"Direct performance\", \"narrative\", \"singing\" mode to the drama plot, so that the dramatic will be further carried out, establish the traditional Western theater drama American. In addition, there is a practice of dividing the drama zone into five curtains.\n\nThe type of drama can be roughly divided into comedy, tragedy.\n\n(1) Comedy: Family entanglement or character is the subject matter, and all drama activities will occur in the street. PlauTus works with a mis-scapement mode, with a large number of languages, approaching the farce style, such as \"Meacaci\"; and Terence's work is in good use of the difference between the two-line structure, the drama is more language Action, can be classified as a romantic comedy, such as \"Brothers\".\n\n(2) Tragedy: Seneca's tragedy is taken from the Greek tragedy, but the algae is satisfactory, rich in moral awareness; the plurality of people often do extreme behaviors under strong motivation, and the drama movements are full of horrific atrocities and day. The vision of human feels, pitting the audience sensory.\n\nFor the definition of the West, China has not \"drama\" tradition. However, when discussing Chinese drama, if it is not divided by strict definition, the ancient Chinese opera should be classified into the big class.\n\nThe roots of Chinese operas can be traced back to the Wu Pre-Qin to the Han Dynasty, but the development of the South Opera of the Song Dynasty has a complete drama text creation. The earliest Chinese ancient drama script is the Southern Song Dynasty. In the Yuan Dynasty, in large, Pingyang and Hangzhou centered, the Yuan Dynasty was shining. The future generation has formed many drama forms, that is, various drama. After the development of Suzhou, the Ming Dynasty was developed, first got the sought after and loved by the Shi Eth, and they won a lot of scripts, and constantly modify the music, and correct the drama theory of Kunqu, and made the legendary scriptures a new mainstream literary form. Subsequently, Kunqu also got the favorite of the late Ming and the Qing Dynasty court royal family, became part of the noble life, became the official affirmative drama art, called \"Ya\"; and the place to play in all parts, widely loved, said \" flower\". So in the Qing Dynasty formed \"Hua Ya Zheng\", it is actually a situation in which the drama is prosperous. This enriches the door class of drama art and also forms their own artistic features.\n\nIn recent years, the drama student in Taiwan has proposed a set of statements. When discussing the origin of the Chinese drama, it should be distinguished \"big play\" and \"small drama\", the big drama is a mature drama, and the small show is the alarm of the drama. The big show is completed after the Jinyuan scorpal, and the previous Song Yilta, the representation of the Tang Dynasty, the drama of the Tang Dynasty. China has a small play before very early.\n\nBefore the cultural contact with modern western, there is no tradition in the \"drama\" (main educational drama) in the West. Chinese traditional drama is a plot, \"song and dance story\", comprehensive music, singing, dance, martial arts and acrobatics, etc., is also drama curved art.\n\nAccording to different classification criteria, drama can be divided into different types:\n\n\u2022 According to the length, modern media is generally short dramas, unit dramas, 1 ~ numerical theater, serial dramas that have been played for a few months in the TV station, similar to the network micro-movies with MV or advertisers, and a complete theme awareness and story in the cinema The released movie creation.\n\nHowever, the most basic, using the largest classification is tragedy, comedy and tragic comedy, among which the tragedy appears earlier than comedy:\n\n\u2022 Tragedy: Aesthetic value: \"It is destroyed to people with valuable things.\"\n\nValuable drama is through performance, various questions and creations, reflecting or presenting a real life with concentrated content or setting, and profoundly describing the grief of the life of the joys and sorrows or human emotions. , Or to discuss the current social value contradiction, or present a reality to deal with destiny or helplessness, or to try the causal effect or consequences that may or or evolve in the case of not existent or impossible hypothesis can trigger the audience. Movement and provincial thinking ... In turn be a sense of entertainment or reach a considerable degree of entertainment!\n\nThe drama text (ie \"Script\") is a basic element of the drama, a prerequisite for a play.\n\nThe most important script is to be movable on the stage. The drama text is not a completion of art until the stage performance (ie \"Performance Text\" is the presence of the final art. Among the Chinese people, there are also scripts that are not suitable for stage performances, even at all, can not be performed. This type of drama text called the case of the case (also called the Book of Zhai), there is no example in the modern drama.\n\nThe literary book of the drama can be appreciated as a separate literary style without performing.\n\nWith the practice of the Western modern drama in the director and the actor training system, the theory of drama gradually expands from the drama text, and then produces new ideas such as \"scene scheduling\". Among them, the more famous proposal is the concept of British drama director Peter Brooke in the 1970s: \"A actor, walking through an empty stage, this is All of them. \"\n\nNo matter how the drama word is defined, only the following conditions can be considered as a drama.\n\nAs long as it is a space, it can be a place where the drama performance is generally referred to as \"theater.\" Historically, there are many places specializing in the play of drama activities, some are outdoors, some are indoors. These venues specializing in the drama include theater, theater, stage, etc.\n\nIn ancient China, the so-called stage is earliered in the singing and dancing ceremony, and a dancer in the ceremony is a high platform that is backed by soil. As the drama development is gradually maturing, there is a trading, a stage, a trip, hook Wait for the performance site.\n\nThe performance of the Western drama from the Open-air theater of Greece, the ancient Roman's amphitheater (ie \"Corner Field\"), has developed to the \"Mirror Frame\", which is suitable for the \"black box\" performance of the Pioneer Experimental Drama (Black Box; or Black Box, black box), \"Experimental theater, etc.).\n\nAncient theater in Greece\n\nRoman theater in France\n\nCurrently, more actors are called the players in the drama. In Chinese history, there are many named drama performers, such as drama, excellent, \u5a3c \u5a3c, \u4eba, \u4f36 \u4e50,,,,,,, Means, and \"\u5a3c\" called drama performers, although the performer is a singer, but in history, there is a long relationship between the drama performance and \u5a3c \u5a3c.\n\nThe organization of the drama performers is more called the trick. It is more called being a play class, and if it is a family of people, it is a family class, called a family class, home class The Ming Dynasty is generally later. TV (English: Television, referred to as: TV) This word represents three different meanings, such as: continuous dynamic images and sounds are converted to electronic signals, and after transmitting electronic signals through various channels, the electronic signal is restored as an image. And sound technology, that is, television technology; refers to the device that receives such an electronic signal, it can receive and restore the electronic signal as a continuous dynamic image and sound, that is, a television; a social and cultural phenomenon, a community The crowds and people use TV as a communication carrier to communicate, message communication, that is, the so-called broadcast process, such as TV program, transmission, reception, and audience for judges and feedback on TV programs. aspect. The facilities for making television broadcasts are called a TV station.\n\nTV is one of the important inventions of the world to believe in the 20th century, and it is still very popular in communication tools. With the advancement of technology, TV is also gradually evolving, such as smart TV and network TV.\n\nThe TV is not the invention creation, but a large group of people in different historical periods and the country. As early as ninety centuries, people began to discuss and explore ways to convert images into electronic signals. In 1900, the term \"television\" has appeared.\n\nTelevision can also be understood as electromechanical television. We know that the movement of the TV picture is the illusion of human visual, that is, you can \"synthesize\" movement, continuous screens, \"synthesis\" moving static screens. How to quickly restore these static pictures, so that people can generate an illusion, there will be two ways. One of them is that the mechanical reduction method is also a Nikovovi. Russian German scientist Paul Gairn Ben Nikov raised and applied for patents in the world's first mechanical TV system in 1884, and he was only 23 years old, still in Germany [1] [2]. After study, he found that if the image is divided into a single image point, it is very likely to transmit images of people or scenes to the distance. Soon, a instrument called \"TV Telescope\" was here. This is a photoelectric machine scanned disk, which looks a stupid brain, but it is extremely created. On November 6, 1884, Nipkov declared his inventions to the Royal Patent Office of Berlin. Write in the first page of his patent application: \"The instrument described here can make an object in A.\" One year later, the patent was approved. The Nikocus tray in this patent is also considered to be the world's first TV image grating. However, Nipkov himself never made a model to prove his design. Until 1907, the progress of the imperial tube technology proved that his feasibility of this system [3].\n\nIn 1897, German physicist Carl Braun invented a cathode ray tube with a fluorescent screen. When the electron beam hits, it is displayed on the screen. At that time, Braun's assistant had proposed a display of the image tube to make a TV, stubborn Braun thought it would be impossible.\n\nConstantin Perskyi made the word Television in a paper submitted to the 1900 Paris Expo. The Persi's paper evaluates the status of electromechanical technology at the time and refers to the contribution of Nikkov and others [4].\n\nIn 1906, the two assistants of German physicist Carl Braun made a picture receiver with this cathode ray tube to perform image reproduction. But their devices reproduce a still picture, should be a fax system rather than a television system.\n\nFrom 1907 to 1910, Boris Rosing and his student Vladimir Solin were verified the use of rapid rotating mirror scanning devices and used cathode rays in the receiver. Television system. Pres Luo Xing left people's sight in the \"October Revolution\" in 1917. After Sulic, I went to the US Radius. He established a pure electronic TV system there. However, his system is ultimately considered to infringe the patent of Philo Taylor Farnsworth.\n\nIn 1911, the engineer Alan Archibald Campbell-Swinton delivered a speech in London, and also reported in the era magazine, which describes how to use a cathode ray tube at the same time in the transmitting end and the receiving end. At the end of the 1920s, when mechanical TV was also commonly used, inventive, Fairo Farnsworth and Vladimir Zuli, were also in studying the work of the full electronic transmission tube, respectively.\n\nRussian American scientist Flagimir Solin opened up an era of electronic TV. He began researching electronic photography technology as early as 1912. In 1919, Zwarley is immigrated in the United States, after working in Westtenhausen Electric Company [5].\n\nIn 1923, a friend of John Logjie Beld, inventor, was told him: \"Since Marcni can launch and receive radio waves long, then the emission image should be possible.\" This made him highly inspirated . Beld is determined to complete the image with electronic signal. He has sold only some of the property and collects a lot of information, puts all the time on the developing TV, and completed the design of the TV. Beld successfully displays the video on the screen [6].\n\nRussian American scientists Flagimil Solin also produce and display images at experimental cathode rays. During the work of Western House Electric Company in 1923, he developed an electronic camera tube. However, during the display of 1925, the image is unclear, the contrast is very low, the resolution is poor, and the image is stationary [7]. This image tube has not passed the experimental stage, but RCA (acquired Xidao Electric Company Patent) believes that the patent conditions of the Fina Swar 1927 image decomposer are too broad, which will exctrue other forms of electronic imaging techniques. Therefore, RCA, after acquiring the patented application of Squorin in 1923, the patent pending litigation was proposed to Falnesworth. The prosecutor of the US Patent Office vetoed the 1935 resolution to formulate the inventions of Fina Sworth priority to Solojin [8]. In October 1939, RCA lostd from court appeals, but they still hoped to produce commercial TV equipment, and RCA agreed to pay $ 1 million in Farnsworth (in 2006 equivalent to 1 thousand 3008 Wan Dollars) In the next 10 years, the use of Farnsworth patents need to pay additional licensing fees. In 1929, Zwurkin introduced a improved model and the results were still not ideal. US ARC finally invests $ 50 million, 1931 Zwalley finally created a camera image tube. In the same year, a complete field test of a complete photoelectric image tube system was carried out. In this experiment, an image consisting of 240 scan lines is transmitted to a TV outside 4 miles (using the mirror to reflect the image of the 9-inch image tube to the TV), and successfully makes TV photography and image formation [9].\n\nThe first semi-mechanical analog television system was seen by the Scottish John Logji Beld in the London in the London. It is called a sign of TV birth. He is called Do \"the father of TV\". Later, his system was adopted by the BBC. After 1937, the BBC terminated the use of this technology. Because the electronic TV system is more popular at that time [10].\n\nDecisive Solutions - The basic principle of TVs is based on the continuous release of electronic flow accumulation and secondary electron storage in the entire scan cycle - the first time I found this technology in 1928, in 1928. 11].\n\nOn December 7, 1927, Philo Farnsworth was transferred to the first use of image dissector photography tube in his laboratory in His Francisco Green Street. Image: A simple line. In 1928, Farnsworth developed a complete system to demonstrate the media and transmitted an animated film by TV. In 1929, this system was further optimized, removing the electric generator, and now his TV system does not have any moving parts. In the same year, Farnsworth used his TV system to transmit the first live Human image: a 3.5-inch his wife PEM closed a dynamic image (perhaps the light is too bright).\n\nIn 1928, the 5th German Broadcasting Expo was opened in Berlin. The TV in the exhibition is the first time as an open product. The distance and scope of the wired mechanical TV communication signal is very limited, the image is quite rough, and the fine picture cannot be displayed. Because only one-third of the light can be improved by the ideal light through the Niphole, it is necessary to increase the hole, but the picture will be very rough. To improve the resolution of the image, you must increase the number of holes, but the hole is small, and the light that can be reduced will be reduced, and the image will be blurred. This defect in mechanical television leads to the elimination of this technique [12].\n\nIn 1929, BBC allowed Beld to carry out public TV broadcasting business. After the 1930s, Beld turned to the research of color TV. After continuous improvement of equipment improvement technology, the TV effect developed by Beld is getting better and better, causing great sensation. Later, \"Beld TV Development Company\" was established. With the continuous improvement of technology and equipment, the transmission distance of Beldow TV has a large improvement.\n\n1933 Russian American scientist Flagimir Sulid also developed a camera tube and image tube that successfully served for TV image. Complete the process of complete electronic development of the TV screening and imaging, the modern television system is basically formed. Today, the imaging principles and instruments received by TV cameograms and television are based on his invention improvements.\n\nOn August 25, 1934, Franklin, Franklin, Franklin, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to demonstrate a complete full electronic TV system [13] in Philadelphia in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Other inventors have just shown some of the similar systems, or demonstrate electronic systems using still images or moving videos. But Fina Sworth is the first system that integrates electronic scanning TV cameras and electronic scanning TV receivers, providing live, dynamic, and black and white images. Unfortunately, his camera needs a strong light, so his work is forced to interrupt.\n\nIn the UK, ISAAC Shoenberg developed Marconi-EMI's own electronic camera tube, which forms a camera manufactured by BBC. Core components. Using this camera tube, on November 2, 1936, a 405-line service was set in the photohed of the Alexandra Palace, which is broadcast by a mast antenna installed on top of the Victorian building. It temporarily broadcasts the Beld mechanical television system of the next door, but it is more reliable and has the best resolution. The mast shaped antenna is always used. This program that is fully played with electronic TV systems has left a deep impression. The report of the Olympic Games held in Berlin in the same year, a total of three cameras [14] were used. Solijin's all-e-camera, but this machine is large, its 1.6-meter focus lens weighs 45 kg, 2.2 meters long, is called to TV cannon. The video signal of these four cameras is transferred to the Imperial Post Center through the cable. After mixing, the image signal is mixed there, and it is emitted through the TV tower. During the Berlin Olympics, the live broadcast of 8 hours a day, with more than 160,000 people watched the Olympic Games through TV [15].\n\nIn 1939, approximately 20,000 families in the UK have a TV, and the US radio company's TV also expands in the New York Expo and starting the first fixed TV program. The eruption of World War II made the development of the developed TV have been suspended for 10 years. After the war, the TV industry was booming, and the TV was also quickly popular. In 1946, the BBC resumed fixed-television show, and the US government also lifted banned ban on the manufacture of new televisions; the TV industry quickly developed. In the United States, from 1949 to 1951, not only the TV programs have been widely broadcast nationwide, but the number of TVs has raised from 1 million to more than 1 million units, many TV stations have been established. Humorous, light songs, cartoon, entertainment programs and Hollywood movies often broadcast in TV [16].\n\nGerman scientists Carolus also made achievements in television development. In 1942, the Carolus Group (including two scientists, a mechanic and a woodwork) made a device. This device uses two Nikockefark disks of two diameters as transmitting and receiving signals. There are 48 1.5 mm small holes on each disc, which can scan 48 lines, with a synchronous motor The two discs are connected, rotate in the 10th screen synchronously per second, and the image is projected onto another receiver. They call this machine as a big TV. The effect of this big TV is much clearer than Beld's TV. However, there has never been publicly displayed, so their inventions are known for people [17].\n\nIn 1956, Kingsberg and Andon designed MODOLL VRLLO recorders have made TV technology a big step. Two ways are generally adopted because of the initial production of television programs. One is to shoot the program with a television film, rinse, and then broadcast by electronic scan. One of the biggest defects used in this way is the live broadcast of the TV program. The other is to spread the signal directly from the camera. This satisfies the needs of those who wish to see the scenes, but it can't play. The appearance of the video change has changed this situation [18].\n\nIn 1972, Sony, Japan launched a 3/4 inches of cassette tape fundamentally changed the production method of TV programs. It is the first cassette tape used in the world's first professional color video screening system [19].\n\nNow, TV is working on a revolution.\n\nIn 1934, Sun Mingjing has developed China's first video, transmission, accepting and playing television principle sample machine in China, as Yang Jianjing's assistant. Yang Ji started \"TV\" to determine the corresponding name of Television in Chinese.\n\nIn 1939, Sun Mingjing officially launched \"TV\" as the 13th Department of Movie Projects in Jinling University, \"TV\" officially became a Chinese university course.\n\nTV program production is the process of forming the sound, image material and related text data and the process of content on the content to finally form a television program.\n\nType Type Classification:\n\nClassification by restore:\n\nCategory by viewing:\n\nCategory by imaging:\n\nPress the aspect ratio of the display screen:\n\n\"Note: There is still a less science The way is divided into large screens, small screens, and micro. The equipment in the micro-micro-high resolution LCD is included in the helmet display, and also includes a DLP display chip in a huge DLP projection wall. \"  It is well known that the improvement of television technology and the production of television programs are needed. Therefore, the development of the development of the TV industry in a country and region is generally proportional to the economic level of the country or region. At present, the earliest national country is the United States, and the last country that introduces TV is located in Borsa in Africa.  Mexican Commercial TV Station Tel Avisa has achieved greater progress in China. In addition to establishing an office, sales show, Format trading with Hunan Satellite TV, jointly producing \"ugly female invincible\" drama, the first quarter attacked the top of the top China TV top. Photography (English: photography) refers to the process of using some special equipment for image records. Generally, we use a mechanical camera or a digital camera for static picture photography, and static photography will also be called photograph. The camera (camera amplifier) \u200b\u200bcan be photographed, such as television, movies. Currently, some of the digital cameras, digital cameras, and features static photography and dynamic photography.\n\nIn photography, a camera or a photocolisser is usually used as a photocilule or a digital memory card as a recording medium. However, there are also exceptions, such as the Men Lei, the active projection method (RAYOGRAPHS) is imaging with shadow on the photo paper without the need to use the camera.\n\nMulti-camera is a lens consisting of a series of lenses, and refracts light after refracting the light after the film or the CCD optical sensing medium, the film itself is also a storage medium, and the signal is stored in a chemical change. The CCD will be stored in digital memory card after converting light into the electronic signal. The stored signal can be restarted to the optical signal through some ways, and then view it with a photo or display. In addition to the lens composed of lens, a few lens is composed of a mirror or a mirror with a lens.\n\nThe front of the camera is a dark box [Note 1] (Camera Obscura) [1] [2], also known as the cassette. The original dark box, just use a hole in a wall of a dark house to project the outside of the scene to the plane. In fact, the literal meaning of Camera Obscura is \"Dark House\" [1] [3]. It is said that the nomads in the ancient Middle East pay attention to this phenomenon: when they are during the day, they hide in the tun, occasionally see the inverted image of the tent, and these images are from the rear of the tent [3].\n\nAncient scholars, such as Mozi, also noticed that the light passed through the small hole [2] [3]. Aristotle refers to the concept of a dark box in his works \"Problemata\" [3]. Haishu uses pinhole units to observe the eclipse [3]. These pinhole devices, the working principle, and tools we are now called pinhole cameras, are exactly the same.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that although the concept of \"dark box\" has appeared in BC, it is about 1604, the word Camera Obscura appears. Mathematician Cople is the first person using this word [3].\n\nIn the 15th century, artists began to use a mount to draw a auxiliary tool. Brunettiki uses the principle of small hole imaging [3], and creates a perspective painting method. With the advancement of technology, some people in the 16th century came up with the convex lens for the dark box [2] [3], making the image more clear and bright. It is worth mentioning that most of these darkboxes are tools that cannot be moved casually.\n\nDa Vinci left a sketch of the blackbox in the \"Atlantic Manuscript\" [3] [1] [3]. Thereafter, it can carry it with you, and install a lens, the lens is installed [2], such a dark box has a focus mechanism, with a mirror, a frosted glass on the mirror can be pair of focus screen, and translucent paper Drawing on glass [2]. In order to make the image clearer, some people want to install a diaphragm-like aperture [2] in the dark box [2].\n\nThe dark box has been developed to the 18th century, and it has been very complete. It has emerged, and has become a good companion of amateur painters and the mason giant on the road. By the early 19th century, the photography pioneer in the British and Japan and other countries began to experiment with a dark box, and a series of photos [2] [3]. However, because the image is not fixed (fixed), the photo is illuminated by light, the image disappears [2], I believe that there is no physical vision. The earliest camera, its appearance and the dark box used by the home is very similar [2]. In fact, there are many photographic pioneers are painters.\n\nThe earliest photo was taken by French Nipps [Note 2] in 1826 [Note 3] [1] [2] [3]. Neps will coated Jewish asphalt (English: Bitumen of Judea) [2] in white [1] [3] version, exposed 8 hours to get this image [1]. He said this technology is a sunlight etching method (English: helikeraphy) [Note 4], but he did not experience this technology [2]. His partner [2] French painter Dair continued to study, invented Darier Photography [1] [2] [3], also known as the silver version of the photography method, bought patent by the French government in 1839 [ 1] [2], and on August 19, the same year [2] announced the birth of photography.\n\nThe advantage of the silver version of the photographic method is the realistic picture, and it is just like [1] [2]. The disadvantage is to watch from different angles, and the photo will become a negative image [1]. Further, since the image is formed on a thin layer of silver, it is easy to damage, and it may also be damaged with a finger. [2]. Later, French physicists thought of gilding for photos, and in the 1840 invention \"gold-plated law\" protection measures, the method is to add chloride to aqueous solution of sodium thiosulfate, then sprinkle on the photo, then use Alcohol lamps are heated to form a gold guard [2]. A photographer wants to get a more direct way, seal the photo in the glass frame [2] [4]. Also, because mercury steam developing [1] [2] [3], it is possible to cause mercury to poison. Other disadvantages include the picture to be left to reverse [1] [2] [3], copy the photos difficult, and shooting costs [2].\n\nHowever, since the technology has been disclosed [1] [2] [3], the silver version of the photographic method is widely circulated around the world, and it has become a mainstream photographing method, until the 1850s, the wet padded photographic method (English) : Collodion process and other new methods are replaced.\n\nAs another important founder, British Tarbot (William Henry Fox Talbot) [Note 5] [1] [2] [3] Carriga was published in 1841 [2] [3]. It is reported that Tarbo is in 1835 [1] [2] [3], with the high-level writing paper with photosensitive materials [2] [3], the first negative photo of the world \"[1] [2] [3 ], That is, the so-called negative piece. By contacting type printed (English: contact print) [1] [2] [3], a positive image photo can be obtained, thereby creating a negatively turningant photographing process [2] [3].\n\nCarriga's shooting cost is lower [2], but also printed the same photo [1] [2] [3]. However, due to the use of paper as a negative film, the image is also relatively fuzzy [1] [2]. The invention of Tarbot is not caused by too much attention relative to the big success of Da Gal. [2] [3]. However, as the first photographic process, Tarbot is still as one of the starters of photography.\n\nTarbot's \"The Pencil of Nature\" was published between 1844 and 1866, which was regarded as the first book in history as a book as an illustration [1]. However, opponents refers to the \"British Algae Photo: Photographs of British Algae: Cyanotype Impressions\" is [3].\n\nOther people who make important contributions to photography include John Herchur Jazz, who created photography [3], and found sodium thiosulfate can be dissolved in water [2] [3], solve Fixed this problem [2]. Other important contributions include Blue Method (English: cyanotype) This classical photography process [3], which became the predecessor of industrial blueprints.\n\nOutth, Tom Mas Weiwood (English: Thomas Wedgwood (photographer), starting to study the reaction of silver nitrate on the rays in the 19790, and try to take a photo with a dark box, but in failure [2]. Weiwood put the leaves on white leather coated with silver nitrate, and the result of unstead of leather became black [2]. Weiwood put some objects on the treated paper, \"copy\" out of these objects, but cannot fix images, time long, the image disappears [2]. It is generally believed that the photos of Weiwood are not saved.\n\nBut in recent years, some scholars have referred to, one of which is considered to be Tarbot works, which may be Wood of Woodwood. If it is true, the photo will be the oldest photo in the world, with more than 200 years of history. [5]\n\nEarly silver version of the photographic method, the exposure time of the photo is long [1] [2], it takes more than ten minutes, it is difficult to capture the portraits and objects. At this stage, the most common photographic theme is landscape and still life, while the most commercial potential is portrait [2].\n\nIn 1841 [1] [2], French photographer Claude (English: Antoine Claudet) was processed with iodine chloride, and the exposure time was successfully shortened to in seconds [2]. Claude to the United Kingdom, bought the silver version of the photography method in the UK's patent, opened a studio in London, England, is a very successful photographer, gaining a lot of honor, but a fire made his portrait works into Wu Have [2 ], Only a small amount of post-world. He left the world is a patented invention, which is a red safety lamp in the dark [2].\n\nThe evolution of the lens also plays a key role [2]. The earliest Darier camera is assembled, and the aperture is only f / 16 [2] [Note 6]. The emergence of large-diameter lenses, shortening the exposure time of the photo, making the photographing more convenient [2]. Among them, Petzfar (English: Joseph Petzval), the University of Vienna, is designed in 1840, the so-called Petzval Lens (English: Petzval Lens), the aperture is f / 3.6 [Note 7] ,Popular. Among them, the same lenses produced by Fulunda are particularly famous, the United Kingdom and the United States also have companies producing such lenses. Due to the numerous manufacturers, the specifications are different, the size is not equal, but the aperture is generally f / 3 to f / 6 [6].\n\nAlthough the exposure time is significantly shortened, the exposure time is still in seconds. If the subject is slightly shaking, the photos taken will not be clear. In order to get a clear image, the photographer will let the guests sit on the chair [2], with almost hidden brackets to fix the head [2] [7], try the danger, try to keep do not move.\n\nIn terms of light source, more natural light is mainly [1] [2] [Note 8], the studio at that time will open in the top of the building [2] [8] [9]. Early studou is generally equipped with a glass curtain wall toward north [8] [10], or the window of the north [8] [10] [Note 9] (located in the middle of the Southern Half Conversion [10]), with diffuse light instead of direct shooting Light shooting [2].\n\nThe camera was quite cumbersome, and to be fixed on a special wooden frame, the height of the wooden frame can be adjusted [2]. According to the weather conditions at the time, the photographer decided to expose [2]. When shooting, the photographer removes the lens cover, the exposure begins, and the photographer times when pocket watch [2]. Cover the lens cover, exposure completed [2], then remove the photosensitive version, get the darkroom treatment.\n\nEarly photographers, there are many painters who are painters [1], portrait photos taken by them, not ugly to see shadows with painting, especially half-length portrait. For example, photographers will imitate the lighting techniques of the Dutch painter Lin Bumbah [1], and the oil painting is used in the background [1].\n\nFire cotton photographic method (English: collodion processes), also known as rubbish printing process, down the wesch (wet rubber printing process, wet pad photography, wet version of the cotton photographic method), and the dry version (Dry rubber printing process, dry version photography, dry version of the cotton photographic method) Two kinds, the fire cotton photographic method is a photographic method in the 1850s, and its appearance has almost replaced the silver version of the photographic law. Flow cotton glue is a viscous liquid, which can be adhered to a glossy glass plate, and can be used as a carrier of silver nitrate, which makes this photosensitive material to the glass plate and form a photosensitive version.\n\nIn 1851 [2] [11], the British sculptor [11] Archer (English: Frederick Scott Archer) [2] [11] published a wet photographic method, but did not apply for patents [11], so there is not much Wealth [2]. Archer was passed away in 1857 [2] [11], the death of the death [2], his invent of the world.\n\nThe wet version of the photographic method is negative with a glass plate [2], and the photosensitive paper can be copied with multiple photos [2], not only reduced photographic cost [2], you can also send photos to friends and family [2]. With the so-called \"business card photography\", the customer took a small photo to the studio, and then put the photo on a personal business card, on the social situations [2], people compete and imitate, become a fashion. Due to the violent money, the big and small film buildings have grown, the competition is very intense.\n\nEquipment manufacturers also take the opportunity to introduce special cameras with multiple lenses, and can take multiple small photos on the same glass plate [2]. With this type of special camera, photographers print more photos with the same cost and workload, charge higher fees [2]. Later, people began to turn their eyes outdoors, to the outdoor phase, becoming a new photographing business. The foldable camera appears.\n\nTo outdoor shooting, a foldable camera, a retractable wooden tripod, and a portable tent and a box used to carry a medicated water, which is simply moving the entire dark room to outdoor. Because the photographic photography method is taken, it is necessary to prepare the photosyrics and take pictures before the photosensitive version. The photosensitive version cannot be stored for a long time. Once drying, you can't take photos. Despite this, early photographers still take pictures outdoors in this technology.\n\nBefore the Crime war broke out, there was already a photographer to shoot a war. Anonymous photographer uses the silver version of the photographic method to shoot in ink war in 1847. Later, the Crimea war broke out.\n\nIn 1914, Germany's \"Lez\" microscope factory designer Oscar Balnak tried to make the use of film film double specifications (24 x 36 mm; 135) camera (movie slices of 18 \u00d7 24 mm), and in 1924 The Leica camera began in the year. 135 The specification has become the most popular film specification, which greatly reduces the camera volume, making the mainstream of photography to documentary photography, and quickly accepted by the public.\n\nDigital camera technology started research in special fields in the middle and late 20th century, and entered the civilian market at the end of the last century. In 1995, Kodak issued a consumer digital camera DC40, marking the start of digital camera civil market. With the advancement of digital technologies and Internet applications, photography is more in-depth into social life, digital music player, mobile phone and other digitized products began to match photography functions, the picture of shooting can be wirelessly propagated with MMS, photography starts diversified development .\n\nThe essence of photography is the art of capturing light, so the exposure is accurate or not, it has become the core of the technical level.\n\nExposure is the camera to pass (usually the external image After the lens group inside the lens is focused) Record the process in the in-in-light medium. The light is strong, so it is imaged by a combination of accurate aperture, shutter and sensitivity. And accurate exposure has a combination of different apertures, shutters and sensitivity, which is the art of photography. Large aperture reducing expansion highlights the theme, and the small aperture increases the depth of view. Fast shutter solidification, wonderful moment, slow shutter, usually slow shutter to increase the motion, such as water, car flow in the evening, etc. When using a slow shutter, the photographic device is often fixed with a tripod to protect the image.\n\nYou must pay attention to the choice of brightness during photography, and it is not too dark, and it is not too bright. Because in the shaded part and the high light part, the contrast is small, the detachment disappears, and it shows a black or one white.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the phase is completed, the image information stored in the medium must be read again by the conversion. Specific methods depends on photosensitive means and media characteristics. For film camera, there will be a process of developing, fixing, enlargement. For digital cameras, you need to calculate the data with your computer, and then output by the electronic device.\n\nPhotographic developer\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the widespread use of digital cameras, use computer image processing software (such as Photoshop) to process the photographing digital file, and carry out the second creation, you can get the image of the author you want, the development of digital technology, bringing a quality leap to photography .\n\nDigital picture post-processing is a very large industry, and now the business picture is a very professional, very detailed post image processing, the color, bright, contrast, etc. of the picture, the overall adjustment, so that the picture is bright Beautiful visual effect. Its industry application covers many fields such as advertising, online shopping, art. With the development of mobile phones, the post-processing function of the picture is now integrated, so that the pictures you taken are more beautified and diverse.\n\nDepth of Field, the depth of field, is a clear level, range, with a focus protagonist, forward, and then relatively clear space, we can simply say that the depth of field is \"clear\" in a photo, Not blurred place.\n\nThe starting point (leading edge) of the depth of field is the beginning of the depth of field, from here to start, until the depth of field (trailing edge) is becoming, so the depth of field is a small calculation method, the \"Jingxiang Type - Jing Shen starting point\". [16]\n\nGenerally speaking, people use visible light, most commonly used by cameras. The camera has a lot of categories due to the differences between scenes and purposes. In integrated, there are several basic parts to ensure exposure process, including:\n\nSometimes, people will also take photographic experimental equipment, which requires only a small hole, photosensitive medium, and control light time method.\n\nSince some media can feel the irradiation of electromagnetic waves outside the visible light, the corresponding photographic technique is developed. The most popular is infrared photography, and even many civil camera can make infrared photography without modification. In the ordinary camera, an infrared photosensitive rubber roll can be performed. However, the corresponding radiation intensity calculation is not enough to give the time required for expulsiveness. Similar situations also appear in stars photography. The electromagnetic wave radiation of different wavelengths can be stored by the medium, and it appears as a picture readable. Ordinary photography is to record the scenes seen by people, rather than visible light, showing images that the human eye is not possible to identify.\n\nChina Doll - Wang Xiaociting\n\nA photo is on the final chemistry.\n\nJuan Mro\n\nCavalry Camp Near Balaklava - CRIMEAN WAR\n\nThe Valley of The Shadow of Death - Roger Fenton (English: Roger Fenton)\n\nX-ray - William Lunqin\n\nView from the window at le gras\n\nThe Horse In Motion (English: Sallie Gardner At A Gallop) - Mai Bridge\n\nMIGRANT MOTHER (English: Florence Owens Thompson) - Database & Sql Blog Articles\n\nEarthrise - William Anders\n\nModern still life photography\n\nArchitecture\n\nstill painting\n\nPortrait Photography\n\nChristmas cake photography - food photography\n\nNature photography\n\nPortrait of a woman photography\n\nPhotography The painting is at the technical level, is a surface as a support surface and adds a color above it. Those surfaces can be paper, oil, wood, wood, glass, lacquer or concrete, etc., the color of the color can be a brush, or a knife, sponge, or even a paint sprayer (English: airbrush), toothbrush, fingers, etc.\n\nIn art term, the meaning of painting includes the purpose of using this art behavior and plus graphics, composition and other aesthetics to achieve the purpose of showing the concept of drawers hope to express.\n\nThe brightness means that the color of the color is dark (degree of depth). The more shallow is that the brightness is high, and the relatively deep is bright, and one of the elements in the painting is the feeling and effect of brightness. Every point in the space has different brightness, which can be expressed in black, white and middle gray in the painting. In practice, the painter can express the shape of the object in parallel, relatively, if only different colors of the same brightness may only indicate the shape of the image. The basic technique of painting includes geometric patterns, many different perspectives and organization (perspective) and symbols. For example, the painter is watching a specific white wall, because the impact of the shadow and the surrounding object reflect, every point will have different brightness, but in the ideal, even in a full black room, the white wall is still White. Because even if there is no light in the room, it is dark, the object still exists, and there is no disappearance, so it can be proved to be correct.\n\nColors and tones are the foundation of the painting, just as the pitch and rhythm of the music. Color is highly subjective, but the psychological effects brought can be observed, but its effect may vary with culture, for example in Western culture, black means death and mourning, but in oriental culture, it is white Indicate\n[1]. Some painters, theoretists, writers and scientists (including songs, Wasi Kanting, and Newton) have proposed their color theory. Moreover, the language can only represent an abstract color, such as red this word to represent light in a range near pure red light in a visible spectrum. As in music, different musicians have a common definition for central C or C\u266f4, but different painters do not have a recognized definition for colors. For painters, the color is not limited to basic color or derived color (such as red, blue, green, brown, etc.).\n\nIn painting, the painter is colored with pigments, so the painter's \"blue\" may be one of the following colors: midnight blue, indocus, cobalt blue, group. Colors are not necessarily related to the meaning of the painting and the method of painting. Colors can add some potential, derived significance, so the feeling of painting is very subjective. This part can be compared with music. Music (eg, central C) similar to the light in the painting, shadow is similar to strength, color is similar to the tone of different musical instruments, although these do not necessarily form a melody, but some different content can be added to music.\n\nModern painters have extends painting, such as srath of three-dimensional derivatives, strictly not painting. Some modern painters will integrate different materials due to the texture of the material, such as sand, water, straw or wood. This is a class like letting Dubi (English: Jean Dubuffet) and the works of Aselm Kaffe. There are also more and more artist communities to use software and Adobe Photoshop or Corel Painter to draw color painting on digital canvas, and can be printed on true canvas if needed.\n\nThe rhythm in the rhythm and music in the painting is as important. If the rhythm is defined as \"pause in a sequence\", there is also its rhythm in the painting. Such pauses allow imagination to participate in it, producing new creation, typing, melody, and coloring. The distribution of these forms (or any kind of information) is quite important in art work, directly affecting the aesthetic value of the work. In the aesthetic value, the free flow of perceived is deemed to be beautiful. Not only in art or science, the energy free flow will enhance its aesthetic value.\n\nIt is known that the oldest painting is located in the French Geote Chauvet, some historians believe that it can be traced back to 32,000 [2]. Those paintings are carved and painted by Red Ochre (English: Red Ochre) and black pigments, the theme has horses, rhinos, lions, bursts, mammoths or hunting people [3]. Stone-hole murals are all common in all parts of the world, such as France, Spain, Portugal, China, Australia and India. The discovery of these paintings has caused many different guess for their purpose. Some hypothetical assumptions are those who think that they think that painting can capture the soul of animals, so that they are more smoothly hunting; some hypothesis think that it is a kind The phenomenon, expressing their respect for nature; there is another assumption that human beings have the needs of self-expression, and those paintings are their results; there is also the point of view of application information [4] .\n\nWestern culture is mainly based on oil painting and watercolor, and has a rich tradition in form and theme. The Eastern is mainly in the painting of ink and mineral pigments, and has a rich tradition in form and theme.\n\nPhotography has a big impact on painting. The first photo has been admired in 1829. After decades, photography technology continued to improve and widely used, so painting was also challenged by the original function of logging the real world. A series of art activities in the late 19th century and early 20th centuries include an impressionist, post-impressionist, wild beast, expressionism, three-dimensionalism, and Dadaism, challenged the idea of \u200b\u200bart revival age. However, Oriental Art and African Art still maintain past style and is not affected by photography.\n\nThe idea of \u200b\u200bmodern art and contemporary art and the historical value and concept of traditional art are different. Therefore, in 1960, he said that the rigorous painting type was dead [5]. However, this did not prevent most of the painters from continuing to use the painting as part or all of its creation. The vitality and variability of the painting in the 21st century have passed the declaration of rigorous art. In the era characterized by cultural diversity (English: cultural pluralism), there is no consensus for the representative style of the times. Artists continue to create in different styles and aesthetic temperament, and their achievements remain in the market.\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, the painting faction continued to have monochromatic paintings, hard-edge painting (English: hard-edge painting), geometric abstractism (English: Geometric Abstract), misappropriation, super-handleism (English: hyperrealism) , Photo truthist, expressionism, minimalism, lyric abstract (English: lyric abstract), Pu Art, Oep Art, Abstract Pistachi, Color Domain Painting, New Expressionism, Laqi, Intermedia (English: Intermediate) Painting, Collection Art (English: Assemblage (ART)) Painting, computer art (English: Computer ART) painting, postmodern painting, Xida painting, three-dimensional canvas (English: shaped canvas) painting, environment murals, traditional characters Painting (English: figure painting), landscape, portrait and glass painting animation.\n\nPainting can be classified according to many different methods, such as by media, subject matter, culture, etc. A modeling does not necessarily only use a type, but can be associated with multiple categories, such as white drawings that can be classified or classified in form.\n\nAesthetics is a research on art and beauty. It is one of the themes discussed by Kant or Hegel etch the 18th century philosopher. Greek philosophers such as Arto and Aristotle also have special discussion on art and painting. In Plato's philosophical system, the status of painters and sculptors is not high. He believes that painting cannot describe truth, painting is just copying actual things, including crafts, no other ingredients, like shoemaker and cast iron [source request ]. However, in Dawen West, the cognitive understanding of painting and the cognition of Plato were considered \"La Pittura \u00e8 Cosa Mentale\" (painting is the things of the soul) [8]. Kant is divided into two concepts of beauty and beauty, analyzes the same place and different places [9]. Although he did not mention painting, it extends its concept to the painting like Joseph Marold William, and Caspa Friedrich.\n\nHegel believes that it is unable to give a common definition in his aesthetic research, thinking of painting, poetry and music is three \"romantic\" art in his aesthetic research, including the purpose of symbolicization, high intelligence [10] [11] .\n\nPainting is a form of capture, record and performance of different creative purposes, and its participants are similarly numerous. The essence of painting can be nature and objective (such as still life or landscape), photographic painting, abstract painting, narrative, symbolism, emotional or political nature. There is a large part of the painting of the painting and the concept of spirituality and concept, which is in the inner wall of the pottery to the inner wall of the Western, and the Bible story scenes on the ceiling. They will express it through the human body itself. Spiritual theme.\n\n[Edit in Wiki Data] Sculpture is a visual art of three-dimensional spatial maternal image made by material materials and means. Sculpture is the earliest use of graphics (by reducing materials) and plastic (by superimposing materials), in materials such as stone, metal, wood, ceramics, etc., but modernist sculptures, materials and creations There is a high degree of freedom, which can be used to create a variety of different materials using carvings, welding, molding or casting.\n\nStone sculpture (STONE Sculpture) is more preserved after a long time, and the sculpture left by the ancient culture is mostly the stone carving and ceramic art. There are also a lot of traditional woodvites in the same time, but many have been decadentable. Many of ancient cultural sculptures have had a bright color, but now most of them have faded [1].\n\nIn many cultures, sculptures are the center of religious worship. They have been very expensive until recently, and large sculptures are still very expensive. It is not a general personal ability, so many large sculptures are religious or political products. Like ancient Chinese sea, India, China, South America and African ancient culture leave a lot of sculptures.\n\nThe sculptures in Western cultures originate in ancient Greece, many Greek sculptors have created many outstanding sculptures during classical Greece. In the middle of the ancient century, Gothic sculptures showed the pain and passion of Christianity. The metichetic works of the Renaissance, like the David of Mi Kaikojo is the famous works at the time [2]. Modernist sculptures are less increasingly conventional processes and humans, and the collection art (English: Assemblage (ART)) and pickup (English: Found Objects) are presented as their work.\n\nSimple classification of sculptures can be divided into round carvings, reliefs and openness. Circular carvings Similar to the statue, referring to the three-dimensional sculptures that can be enjoyed from all angles, and because the appreciators may appreciate the work from any angle, each side needs to plan [3]. There is at least one of the embossed is attached to the background, and can be classified as a discussion and high relief according to the projection method [4]. When there are many things in the work to be narrative, the way to use circular engraving is not easy to presen, and embossed is usually used. In architectural sculpture (English: Architectural Sculpture) and other items (like pottery, metal products or jewelry) are decorated with small sculptures, it will also choose embossed. Openwork revoles are a sculpture between circles and reliefs. On the basis of relief, the hollowed background is divided into single-sided permanent and double-sided permeable.\n\nAnother classification is classified according to its work, and the vulture is removed from the work, and the plastic is to complete the work in a manner of shaping the material. It can be sculptured like cast, stamping and molding, and multiple identical finished products can be made at a time.\n\nSince ancient times, huge sculptures have a strong attraction to people. The highest statue is the 2018 Indian unity statue, 182 meters high (597 feet) [5] [6]. Another magnificent statue is the riding statue of the Knight on the horse (English: Equestrian Statue), which is not often seen in the last decades. Among the body sculptures of the real people, the most often look at the avatar, or half body (English: bust (sculpture)), only for half your chest above. Small sculptures include small statues (English: figurine), generally less than 18 inches (46 cm) statues, or embossed squash, medals or coins.\n\nModern and contemporary arts have joined many non-traditional ingredients, such as sound devices (English: Sound Sculpture), photovoltaic, environmental art (English: Environmental ART), environmental sculpture (English: Environmental Sculpture), Lock ON (English) : Lock On (Street Art)), dynamic art (English: Kinetic sculpture) (related to the movement of objects), earth art, field-specific art. Sculptures are an important part of public art. If there is a collection of sculptures in the park, there is a sculpture park (English: sculpture garden).\n\nThe most common use of sculptures is related to religion. There will be gods in many cultures, these gods are more than an ancient Greek art, such as the Olympian Zeus God Statue). In the most innermost sanctuary in the Egyptian temple, although there is no maintenance to the present, there is evidence that its size is not large, even in the biggest temple. The same is true in Hindu, common is very simple and old Linga. Buddhism brought these religious sculptures to East Asia, and there is no similarity tradition before East Asia, but some simple shape of sculpture (like \u742e \u742e) is a weigher used.\n\nThe concept of small sculpture as a personal property can be traced back to the earliest prehistoric art, while the sculpture of public art is generally the power to show the rulers to the viewer. This type of sculpture can be pushed to 4,500 A year ago. In archeology and art history, the appearance of huge sculptures (may also include disappearance), but it may be quite difficult to trace the time point that appears or disappears, because some use like wood or other can't save long-lasting Materials, and may not leave a record [7].\n\nTotem pillars is an example of the large artwork made by the ancient use of wood, and the residue cannot be found in archeology. At that time, it could concentrate on producing large commemorative sculptures, including many materials for long-distance transportation, as well as those who hired sculptures (should be a full-time job), which means that they have been more advanced, social organizations and division of labor. Recently, the bronze era sculpture found in the Samsung Site in China, and its size is twice as many people. Many impressions on Chinese ancient culture have been rewritten. The Chinese bronze sculpture for Chinese ancient culture is more small [8].\n\nThe Indian River Basin Civilization is also an old and advanced civilization, but there is no huge commemorative sculpture, but there is a fine little god and seal. Other cultures, like ancient Egypt and Easter culture (English: History of Easter Island), which will put a lot of resources on large commemorative sculptures very early. China's Qin Shihuang Terracotta Warriors is a large number of real people in the Tomb of Qin Shihuang.\n\nFor the collection of sculptures, you can trace back to the Greek, China, and the two river basins, and also showcase the collected sculptures in half-disclosed models. Since the twentieth century, the restrictions on the topics in the past have been greatly relaxed on large sculptures, and there is an abstract theme and any type topics today. Many of the sculptures now have planned a period of time in the museum and gallery, so how to ship and store is also one of the considerations when making large sculptures. Small decorative figures (English: figurine) are mostly ceramic materials, today is quite popular, but often being modern art and\nContemporary art is ignored, and in the past, there are often such artworks in the era of Rococo, and in the ancient Greek Tower Tatanigra figurine (English: tanagra margarines) has formed an industry, in East Asia and the former Columbus Period (English: pre- There are also many similar sculptures in Columbian ART. Small sculptures with furniture and other items are in ancient times, such as Nimrudi Ivory products (English: nimrud ivies), Baghram ivory products (English: Begram Ivories), and Tamon grave Funeral products.\n\nThe portrait of the sculpture is starting from Egypt. There is a ruler of the 32nd century BC in Nalmai Temple, and 27 ancient sub-statues in Morco Namia (English: statues of gudea) It is the image of the Lagshist, 2144-2124, West Yuan. In ancient Greece and Rome, you can have a maximum honor mark in the public place. It is also the wish of the elite part. If there is an open statue, it may appear on the coin [9]. In the country of Egypt and Near East, the statues of the open space are almost the privilege of the rulers, and the statues of other rich people will only appear in their cemetery. In the former Columbus during the Americas, generally only the portraits of the ruler, the earliest may be the huge head (English: Olmec Colossal HEADS) for about three thousand years ago (English: Olmec Colossal Heads). There are many statues in East Asia to be religious. The sculpture of the Mediterranean period is revived again in the middle of the August Edition. At the beginning, he only appeared in the tombs statue and coin, and later launched a large decoration period, and there was a new type, such as a personal portrait medal.\n\nAnimals are one of the topics in human sculptures, some are realistic, but they are also a fictional animal or a monster. In the Chinese grave and temple, it will use the stone carving of animals as a decoration. Plant sculptures are common in jewelry and some ornaments, but large sculptures in Byzantine art and Islamic art are also plants as the theme, and there are also plant sculptures in Eurasian tradition, like brown leaves and vines such as brown leaves and vines. It has been used twenty years ago.\n\nAnother common sculpture in prehistoric culture is an increased version of daily necessities, weapons or containers, and material is not practical, which may be used in etiquette or exhibiting. Like China, Olmek Civilization or Neolithic Age Europe (English: Neolithic Europe) will use jade, and the early large pottery in Metomya is made of stone. Europe and China will also use bronze to make large ax and swords, such as Oaksborne deck (English: Oxborough Dirk).\n\nSince the sculpture of the material is quite a variety of clay, stone, wood, metal, gypsum, resin, ivory, British composite soil (English: Milliput). I develop a few categories:\n\nSculpture production methods are engraving, plastic, pile, stickers, welding, knock, editing, etc.\n\nSome sculptures are quite sensitive to the conditions of the environment, like temperature, humidity, and exposed to light and ultraviolet rays. Acid rain can also destroy specific building materials and stone carvings, because of the calcium reactions in the rain (limestone, sandstone, marble and granite), forming gypsum and peeling.\n\nMany contemporary sculptures will be displayed in public cases. If the sculpture can be recognized immediately, it is generally not easily stolen. However, in the early 20th century, the value of metal is high, so large bronze sculpture may be stolen by millions of sculptures because of the attention of the thief, melting into metals due to the value of the thief due to the attention of the thief. After selling it later. The price of the sold metal may only be small in the value of the original sculpture [10]. The hand technology refers to the hand-made process, hand-made, simple tools, usually related to art, its creation requires skill, proficiency, and a certain degree of beauty, media may include weaving, ceramic, paper, embroidery Sewing, wooden work with others. [1] The craftsmanship is different from the mechanical manufacturing methods of mass production, usually by a certain artistic concept, and is manufactured in the manner of hand workshop. Produced products are usually called handicrafts. \"Handicrafts\" generally carries the cultural tradition of the nation. When contemporary artists are making \"handicrafts\", they often add modern art elements. Family is a common living unit formed by marriage, blood, adoption or cohabitation. [1] [A 1] Family relationships consisting of marriage, with children who have no blood relationships, with children with blood, produce blood, and proposed blood. [C 1]\n\nThe word family can further extend to the ancestors, such as those listed in the family; while the horizontal also covers the relatives and relatives of the relationship between the marriage; Other people in the house consist of.\n\nBecause of a common life, a family will be confused with a household, and a household consisting of households and hosts in the house will be statistically. Due to blood, the family will be confused with the family, but a family can be divided into several families. Family is often confused with marriage, and marriage includes both relationship establishment and termination, also including mutual obligations and commitments, and families contain economic social dependencies in members. [B 1] It is also worth noting that \"Comrade Family\" is not different from the \"heterogeneous family\", and many studies have confirmed that there is no significant difference in the growth of the heterogeneity or comrades. . [2]\n\nThe core family is usually doubtful, plus their children, live in a private or separate house. Expanded to the grandparents who contain together, relatives, and even married children and their partners and descendants, the so-called big family. [B 1] Composition family, not only relying on the name of marriage, do not want to get married, and another civil combination option. France's PACS, Germany's same-sex partner, Canada's CommON law, is the starting point for changes to their families and marriage. [3]\n\nAlthough family structures in different societies may vary, all human society have some form of families, that is, the family is one of the universal culture of universal culture; the US anthropologist Murdoch (George P. Murdock pointed out in 1949 that the core family exists in all human society, the core family is not the only major family form in a society, or it is the basic unit in the larger family, in all human society, The core families are a group that has a strong effect. [4] [5]\n\nFamily has a variety of valuable features for members, the most important thing is that it provides family members with emotional and psychological security, [6] [7], especially because of their lives and their partners Safety brought by the relationship between children. [8] In addition, families provide economic functions for their members, as well as families and stability of society, regardless of the race, gender, and religious beliefs of family members. [9]\n\nThe world's top medical period \"New England Journal of Medicine\", \"New England Medical Journal\" There is no difference between health status and general young adults. \"Showing multi-family members have no negative effects on society and future generations.\n\nHistorically, in most cultures, families are parental systems or by men, this period is generally a big family. The industrial revolution and the rise of the city have made many changes in the composition of the family. This process leads to the transformation of large home systems. [10] [B 2]\n\nAfter the industrial revolution, new families have been produced, and modern families are different from the past families. The current family is more like a consumer unit instead of producers, family members generally work rather than at home. [10] The public authorities, including the government authorities instead most of the original family, such as care for the elderly, patients, education youth, entertainment, etc. The development of technology makes the couple have a decision to play the power of children and to give birth to a few tires. [B 2]\n\nFamily law in different cultures is different, but its most basic effect is to define the law between family members and the various relationships between families and society. The importance of the family law includes the conditions defined by marriage and change, the position of future generations, the child's inheritance of the property. Multiple aspects of family law lies in social rights and interests, and the personal interests have produced wonderful balance. [B 3]\n\nThe important rules of the future of the marriage are to let the brides will legally transfer to their grooms. In addition to his wife's custody, the husband has almost all things to control his wife. For example, the Women will lose all legal status after the woman is married. The exception is that Muslim women have a lot of control over their own personal property rights. [B 3]\n\nAmong the home systems of many countries, their members have only two generations, which are parents and their minor children. In Japan, based on the 1947 \"Japanese Civil Code\", the relative group affiliated to the same household registration is called a family. The family is completely consistent with the household registration, and the member is not a person who lives together, but it is still a family member. Switzerland, in the \"Swiss Civil Code\", family must make a family in a family life that work together to work together. Parents have the right to develop their own regulations and execute, and have obligations to protect home property, and they also implement home property. [C 2]\n\nConfucian culture has a profound impact on Chinese traditional society. The law is known as \"kiss\", \"respect\", or it is also known as three. Family members are distinguished by respect, legal elders, husbands are respectful, late generations, wife is humble, the same behavior, respect. In social life, the former has an overwhelming power of the latter, that is, the \"father wants to die, the child is not dead\", is to feudal parents. Marriage pursues a wife and a wife, and there are more generations of tangible, more gathering, and form a clan. Such a family is called an expanded family. [11]\n\nTraditional families affected by Confucian culture, especially the three-regular affected, have the following ideas:\n\nAt the end of the Qing Dynasty, the political, economic patterns of the society became the new idea of \u200b\u200bhuman equal equality, and China. The feudal parents have become critical objects, and the legal relationship has also changed. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the family relationship stipulated in the Marriage Law is as follows.\n\nA large number of human scholars and sociologists are studying \"family\", mostly indicated by parents and their children with relationships with marriage. Most of the above scholars believe that in all society, the organization has a similar fixed function. It is necessary to maintain the presence of society is the main role of any activity. The individual activities of individuals form various roles in one organization, which often surrounds a special function, such as cultivating children. Even each character suggests another role of interest, such as in marriage, two characters of gender have two stakeholders of husband and wife. [A 2]\n\nIn order to distinguish the functions of each role, you should first know the role of the role and role. For example, in each society, both husbands and their wives have different rights and obligations, but they have the same set of functions, which is to meet each other's in terms of quality. [A 2]\n\nGenerally speaking, family has four basic roles: sex, birth children, economics, and educational elders. If there is no sex and fertility, the society must disappear; if the economy is in the economy, life is difficult to continue; or there is no education, cultural customs will be broken. There is also a fifth role, but also a popularity, both the status of society. The actual functionality of this role is that in society, every legal child has the chance of all rights and success in the social structure, and also assumes considerable obligations. It is believed that only families can make individuals to achieve this role in all social interactions. [A 2]\n\nAs people can know, in some society, the family cannot meet all the roles. For example, Mexico's El Nayar can be separated after the man is involved in the legality of the children's legitimacy in the future. After that, women can also maintain sexual relationship with the proper social status, and their husbands have no economic responsibility, and they cannot have special sex rights, and they cannot have any needs for their children. Therefore, in the family relationship of Naar, sex, childbearing children and husband and wife, the economies of the husband and wife are divided. [A 2]\n\nIn addition to this place, in general, husbands and their wives have different role properties to make families produce all their roles. From a historical inspection, after analyzing a large number of social organization samples, the results of their role are basically that the husband's role is representative of the family, his and sexual-independent of other roles belong to the economic and social status. Since the husband is a bridge between family and society, the wife often needs to bear the bond between husband and children. The relationship between husband and wife is not a simple economic cooperation, and there is also a sexual needs. Wife's role is usually engaged in raising and educational offices in the family. She has a broader emotional and emotional dependence than her husband's role. This is the popularization of the roles of both parties. It is existed in a large society. of. [A 2]\n\nJust when people focus on the diversity of families in different types of societies, some sociologists have begun to try to find the function of family popularization. Just like sex, prosperity, economic collaboration, and children's socialization, the conclusions of all humanity, the same, diversified family organizations are also the impact of social structure on family life. Derived. Because the family's production makes the society to continue inheritance, and the family's morphology is different from science and technology, population and regional factors, as well as political, economic and religious factors. [A 3]\n\nWhen the family is in the form of a degree to a certain extent, it should manage the form of marriage according to social practices. Today's world understands that society is strictly forbidden to get married, this ban often occurs with the incest taboos, which prevents the sex between these people. The incest taboos generally refers to the abnormal relationship between father, mother and son, and brother and sister, but also need to determine the special regulations from the family, some taboos do even extend to the side relatives. But for the incest does not have a taboo, it is in part of the ruling class. For example, in ancient Egypt and Peru, in order to maintain the family's property and rule, they encourage the brothers and sisters. [A 4]\n\nIf the taboo who lost incest, a family member will continue its own single blood, to inherit the rights and obligations of the property, the power status, the economic rights and the ceremonial ceremony, so the spouse must also be limited to family members. . The contraindications of nearby parents will make the traditional and value status of the aforementioned families, which makes it changed or even destroyed because of the introduction of different values \u200b\u200band standards held by another family. [A 4]\n\nThe restriction on the spouse selection prevents the change between the family separation. The more inheritance of his family's values \u200b\u200bis more than those of other families from values. One of the important tasks of the family and relative system is to limit the freedom of personal marriage, but in some society, individual marriage in the family does not appear in the previous circumstances. [A 4]\n\nDifferent society, there are many different restrictions on the choice of spouses and the methods of pursuit. These restrictions should be related to property and social status, and the other is also related to social changes and social and economic development. Its parents should have different degrees of restrictions on the pursuit of pursuit, as follows: 1. Child marriage, the choice of their partners is determined by parents; [13] 2. Marriage with parents to determine suitable objects; 3. Let Outside the possible object of the choice of the choice of the selection standard in the parent; 4. Before marriage, it is necessary to strictly monitor via parents, such as Spain's teenage needs to be monitored; 5. Non-mandatory from relatives, parents or friends Restrict; 5. Compliance with personal free choice. [A 4]\n\nThere are many ways in marriage. Single associate or a wife's wife, a person can legally owned and recognized spouses. There are two forms: 1. A husband, a man, allowing a man to have a wife at the same time; 2. A wife is multi-husband, license a woman has more than one husband. According to historical records, the phenomenon of marriage is rarely discovered in society, but it is very popular in the idealized region of the Plato and other philosophers. [A 5]\n\nIn the original agricultural society, marriage is often associated with women's economic roles. Another wife is more likely to happen in a society where women have relatively low in women, and in the society where women's production capacity will have a husband or a wife and a wife. In society where women agriculture is lower, there is only a small demand for women. These customs are mainly dowry, or exchange gifts between the groom and the bride's two families. [A 5]\n\nThe other situation is different, and the groom will be required to serve the service to compensate for the women's family, or the man's family needs to pay some value to exchange the new lady. Compared with other marriage methods, a wife is soaked. This situation will occur in a region where the economy is very economical, and the woman's contribution is not a region. The groups of these places, their brothers, fathers or sons, etc., which is more likely to have a woman married to a woman. [A 5]\n\nCheck the literature of sociology, in which different marriage forms and family organizations have many different speech. These different remarks come from many reasons. For example, after the progress of anthropology, it will naturally introduce more precise classification. Example: Once the mother's society and the parent society, it is based on the family attached to the mother or his father to distinguish the organization. Usually, it is not only a pass in the mother society. It should include the rights of husband and wife in marriage, the inheritance of wealth and the power of the family, etc., is a family of mother. [A 6]\n\nThe following studies have shown that this classification is not correct, in fact, such features often be independent of each other. At the same time, the relationship between the family is abnormal, and the composition of the family and family relationship is also unknown. For example, in some society, although a man is affiliated with father's family system, there are also some rights and obligations of the ceremonies in the mother's ethnic group. [A 6]\n\nAnother difficult point is that different terms are used in the same thing. Such terms are in different concepts of family or family. It is often considered to be the most basic form of core families, including father, mother and child. However, other vocabulary can also be used to describe this type of home. Such as: marriage family, simple family or base family. [A 6]\n\nThe significance of the core family This is to bring the family to the nuclear nucleus, and relatives surround around this nucleus, and the peripheral relatives are more distant. Sometimes the family is expanding because of the individual relationship belonging to two families, but in his own family, his status is a child, but after the child once again, he became a parent in his home. Therefore, a single core Family will have a direct relationship with families with similar members, and the relatives in which indirect relationships are increased. [A 6]\n\nThe family family is a parent-child combination that exists due to parental marriage. It is different from the blood-proof family combined with blood relationship. The relationship between the blood family will have two contexts, which can be done by a grandeur to a certain descendant, or based on the same ancestors to calculate the proximity of the descendants. [14] [15] Because many of the characters can be implemented in the same utility in the family, in order to avoid conflicts, one of them should be specified to play this type of role. So, this part of the designated is a home form in society. [A 6]\n\nThere is no society that is a family or blood family, just in the organization of family life, the role of couples and parent-child relationships. In certain societies, the blood family will be highly organizational and functional, and there is also a clear boundaries between members. [6] But other society, such as the United States, this blood family lacks similar organization, only a little function, the boundaries between members are more vague [16]. [A 6] [17]\n\nBecause of a wife and their children's partners and children of children, they are different from simple families. Mixed home organizations often consist of Divisions and lives in Duofu. Society also usually constitutes a mixed home as long as there is any of the aforementioned any one. [A 6]\n\nThe base home is a home for distinguishing between parent children, and has different (iens) between the huge family groups that have been combined with individual families. Sometimes base families may also be combined with relatives living in one place (such as joint families) because of blood relationships. Or under the rule of parents, uncle and other blood relatives, more basic families will connect to each other (such as expanding the family). [A 6]\n\nBasic families may be integrated because of the elders in the blood family, the heads, leaders and soldiers. These units are important to many societies that are often occupied by the hered system. They develop status, living methods, and political, economic obligations. [A 6]\n\nThere are several ways to determine the pedigree: 1. Male members of the family (Father family); 2. Female members in the family (mother family); 3. Members of men and women (double-line families); 4. One party (single family) by male or female members. [A 7]\n\nDifferent restrictions on the rule of the rule of the hereditary system. The parent or mother family in a complete single system has more personal obligations in the relatives of the mother or father. Someone can participate in the event of the father-in-law family team, and the relatives of the mother can also be very enthusiastic, and vice versa. More extremely, the relatives of the parents have complete rule, in any case, most sociologists only recommend appropriate distinguishing between parents and relatives. [A 7]\n\nThe organization of family relatives in each society is different. Among the basic units of society, the important inheritance groups of political and economic life are an incense group in the family, often consisting of brothers and their respective children. After a few generations, the family organization will expand, so the family is divided into the analysis, the new incense group is formed. In a certain society, the incense group may be the significance of the basic family is subject to a national or more family system. [A 7]\n\nThe family and the clan implementation have made family integration into a larger organization, which is often attached to the leader of the rule and politically. Most of the groups usually composed are more territory than the original family and a broader forces. The family will often limit the choice of marriage objects. For example, Kiowa Apache's family system is characterized by single lineage and loves the family within the family. Excluding the favorite of the same family, is also a marriage of the group, which is rarely limited to the choice on the partner. [18] Cheyenne has fully restricted other marital status, in addition to the two-legged family, and more severely controls the rule of the family or branch to maintain the original social value and standard [19]. [A 7]\n\nSince the mid-19th century, scholars have begun to study families as a social system, which is in the research trend of the origin and evolution of the society. Darwin published \"Species Origin\" in 1859 [20] [21], 1861 Henry Maine published \"Ancient Law\". Although he disagreed with \"no matter how, the human society is coming through the same continuous evolution\", it is regarded as the basic relationship between the status and marriage as the basic relationship in the modern social crisis [22]. [A 8] [23]\n\nEarly research families, social evolutionists will discuss families as a single continuous body from primitive society to the feudal society to industrial society. Their assumption is that all home forms are the same evolution process. Germany's socialist theoretical Engels is analyzed by Marx's point of view, which is \"mother\" (DAS MUTTE RRECHT) published by Bahofen (Das Mutte Rrech) in 1861, starting with the family. It is part of the social system to study. [24] The story of the Bible and the record of the ancient Greek Roman family have become the basis for the history of Western society. Bahofen tried to use the derailment of sex as a starting point, and then list a way to modern home. He speculated that the origin of the initial love was accompanied by women's betrayal. After adhering to your own point of view, the woman continued to live a calm life, and since then, he gradually lost the control and political power in family life. The consequence of loss of power is that the male right replaces the foundation of female rights to the family. [24] The researchers began inheriting mother-induced (ie, to track women's context) as a homework, but not only to the interest of special tribes in Africa. [A 9]\n\nIn addition to Bahifen, the basic characteristics of John Ferguson Mclenna in Scotland also hold similar theory on the basic characteristics of the mother's inheritance in the family evolution process. [25] [26] [27] It describes in 1865 \"Primitive Marriage\" books.\n\nIn Meclennan model, there is constant nomadic nomads with other nationalities. When the enemy surrounded them, they perceived that the woman was too weak and therefore implemented a strategy of massacre baby girl. From this woman, it is greatly reduced, which will lead to the killing of some very special women. Since then, women are transferred to the male family by their families, and the children of her fertility are also male family system. Because his own tribe lacks women, we have to go back to women in other tribes, and the most beginning is all methods that have passed women, and then they will begin to get women from exchange. In McRerennan's structure, the marriage and foreign marriage is the most basic concept, which is still popular in anthropology and sociology. [28] [29] McRerennan will define marriage with foreign countries to be strictly prohibited to marry. Its learning is that family life begins with foreign countries. [A 9] [25]\n\nEven in the 19th century, scholars are still a lot about the evolution of the family. The American anthropologist Louis Henry Moore Moore believes that the results of the foreign countries are naturally selected. It is believed that it can promote this tribe in their region, and people who have improved, the cultural area has expanded. Mooregen is classified as a foundation based on the names of the family members, and if all the brothers of the father have used \"Father\". He believes that the \"parents\" used in today's people, the essence is a use of genetically inherited from the past, from the former so-called \"parents\", it is considered to contain all possible people. According to Moore's theory, the use of \"parents\" is increasingly strict, and it is representative of someone who is inherited by someone. [A 9] [30]\n\nEngels' \"home, private ownership, and the origin of the country\" rely on Moore's evolutionary theory. However, Engels summarizes the principles of the family to control the production method, not the decision of inheritance. [31] In his evolutionary process, the family must be adapted to the change of social division of labor, which has become the promotion organization of economic and wealth control. Engels believes that the subsequent stage of the division of labor is the production of socialist society. The family's characteristics will be an independent and women of the property rights, but this needs husband and wife commit to each other will continue. It is believed that this is the basic form of family in the proletarian system. [A 9] [32] [33] [34]\n\nIt is that the Finnish sociologist Edward West Mark believes that the family is developing in a lot of different paths. In the work of \"Human Marriage History\" in 1891, his view is: [35]\n\nAs with his functionalists in favor, West Mark assume that incest is a common feature in all families. It is believed that the core family belongs to the most basic home model, and the family incense continues to continuing, and the way of marriage with foreign countries is developed from the incest taboo. [A 10] [36] [37]\n\nBaronislav Malinovsky, Baronislav Malinovsky is the followers of West Mark. He studied the method of family function analysis and proposed the role of father in relatives. Its view is that although the parent is uncertain, there must be a social father in all society to provide legal status for its children in society, and the father is the legitimate security of family members, so that in the mother society This is also true. [A 10] [38] [40] [41] [42]\n\nMalinovsky assumpquately, incest taboo and core families are generally widely accepted by modern social researchers. Based on psychological analysis, functions recognize that incest taboos are suppression and sublimation of personal impulse demand, such behavior makes men to achieve and reach the required social status. [A 10] [38] [40] [41]\n\nAccording to this point of view, the root cause of civilization and continuous roots are incest. Its popularity and core home pattern, affecting the American humanologist Murdock About home function model [43], and US sociologist Talcot Parsys The association between the family and the general social system [44] [45]. [A 10]\n\nThe development of urbanization and industrialized society has brought problems such as poverty, slums, crimes and individuals, which makes additional academic traditions in the mid-19th century, this school is a sociologist who criticizes the institutionalism of society. [A 11] [C 4]\n\nGermany's sociologist Lille is based on observation and query about the experience gained, and the \"family\" is in the crisis and disintegration state, leading the conservative reform to stabilize the parent system. In 1855, FR\u00e9D\u00e9ric Le Play conducted two books such as miners and other workers, published two books such as \"European workers\" and \"family composition\", and believed that family organizations need to follow social and physics, Especially related to poverty, parental blood family is studied. Following the August Confudent, Lep is tired to consider the basic social unit of conservative and continuity. It is believed that the general characteristics of people's living areas will determine the work of people, then affect the model of the family. Then, the family will affect the other aspects of society. Lepu is a profound impact on poverty, family economy and family continuation. [A 11] [C 4]\n\nThe root cause of many family problems is the concept of thinking families as a \"overall personality\", this concept is proposed from the American sociologist Burgess, which caused unity and provision of interference families. Research on the Factors of Interactive Problems. For example, discovery in the study, the concept of marriage will continue to appear in marriage and continue to the next generation. [A 11] [46]\n\nIn developing health and personality attitude, the role of the family is crucial. Studies on children in adoption institutions have shown that young children need mother like to avoid obstetrics and intelligence. Lack of father love also hinders the child's development of appropriate behavior. [A 11]\n\nMany sociologists are useful for families in mental treatment. One of the important roles of Malinovsky is to verify the assumption of the common phenomenon of the love mother's complex proposed by Sigmund Floyd in the mother department of Tolble Islands. If this is a child, it exists, then the special family cannot affect the left and right. [47] Malinovsky found that there was also intimate relationship between the father and son, and the power and control of the mother and son were attributed to the mother's brother. The son did not hate his father, but he had a jealous emotion to his mother. Malinovsky's information is clearly presented by Freud's psychological phenomenon, which is from home. According to research results, people can find a home form of forming psychological barriers. The study also indicates that the interference relationship between the public conflicts and relatives between parents, often affects the psychology of children in the family [48] [49]. [A 11]\n\nIn the early 20th century, many sociologists worried that their families would lose their functions. In 1929, the American sociologist William Willin Ogben studied the trend of American society, discovered economic, maternity, protection, granting, education and religious family basic functions already have other organizations. [50] The last function of the family is emotional and fertile. [A 12]\n\nAnother American sociologist Soro Jin (Pitirim A. Sorokin) presented that the functionality of modern families will decrease to \"the place where the night is sexual relationship\". [51] [52] Additional sociologists, Birjis believes that family functions are transferred to external agents, which is in line with modern urban society [46]. [A 12]\n\nAfter World War II, the family considered a social system research trend. William Lloyd Warner pointed out how family and blood are closely related to the social class system in modern society. Other sociologists focus on how family life and how relative relationship affect a person's future. Parents' funds, relatives, and relatives have established organizations, making sociologists believe that in modern urban society, families and relatives still maintain their applications. [A 12]\n\nThere is also a special relationship between modern society and family characteristics. Although some specific trends continue for a long time, it still can't get rid of this factor. People born after the Baby tide after World War II After adult, the importance of the relationship between the family and relatives has also disappeared in the 20 years of war. Subject to some social trends present before World War II or germination on the homes. [A 13]\n\nNow the main trend of society is the rise in migration, the reduction in rural population, the industrial and commercial enterprise mergers and acquisitions, the population flows into the city and suburbs, the great progress of manufacturing technology, the level of manufacture, the rapid development of the government and network technology, and The most important family is the innovation of contraceptive technology. [A 13]\n\nThese popularization trends significantly reduce the differences between men and women in society and economy, politics, laws. Women's education is rapid than men. Women's employment rate has greatly improved, especially in professionals and management. Married women want long-term maintenance of employment. In contrast, many couples have begun to think that family responsibilities and attitudes are even greater than if they are satisfied. [A 13]\n\nIn addition, the world's excess is also concerned about problems. On the one hand, fear of society is unable to cope with the food, waste, environment and social security factors required for the next generation. On the other hand, it is also worried that the production and service technology can be completely controlled by a few labor, so that a large number of people will become excess resources, and the number of unemployment is increased. [A 13]\n\nThe current social and economic trends have also promoted people, especially young people, and paying attention to the abnormalities of individual freedom and individualism, and paying attention to freedom from the concept of traditional family life. Take advantage of the social movement of citizens' freedom has also supported this view, forming more consequences in sex, marriage, and productivity. [A 13]\n\nPeople's marriage is a large latency, and children in childhood are often nearly 30 years old. Married couples do not have children's proportion, divorce rates, and remarriage, and even maintain a lot of marital sexual behavior is much smaller than the older generation. [A 13]\n\nIn accordance with the early 1990s, there were 10% divorce rate in the US marriage population, and it was not yet married for nearly half of the 24 years of age. The proportion of birth children in the family is reduced, 50% down to 40%. This trend is further distinct, and it is almost considered that this situation has a reversal possibility. [A 13]\n\nThe change of marriage, the change in sexual concepts and birth rates also promotes the diversification of home life, including always single, unmarried and cohabitation, same-sex, same-sex cohabitation and government and community arrangements. [54] It is difficult to measure the correct unmarried number in these families. It is pointed out in the 1990s, in the 1990s, about nearly 80% of the population is 20 years old, with its parents, spouses, women under the age of 30, with unmarried male, less people and same living together. Have a complete freedom of living. In recent years, many men and women have attracted many men and women, but about 90% of adults have been married and have children. [A 13] The average age of American women's birth first fetus has been delayed from 1970 to 2012, of which the senior woman is more. [55]\n\nBecause of the dramatic changes in family life, the society has a sharp change, but these changes cannot be made to \"death\", but only a change, including the modern society from ancient times to today, many societies have Similar features. [57] Some observers maintain pessimistic arguments because they have discovered certain stipulations and practical roles, and this part of the provisions and role in their eyes are important security for maintaining home systems. [A 13]\n\nAfter studying the corresponding society, such as China, the Soviet Union (Russia), Greece, India and the North African Arab World and the Middle East, and people have found that the family system of these societies is roughly similar to American society. Some advanced societies have long been developing a family policy to increase social welfare. There are also many European national legislation to provide family allowances, giving difficult domestic legal economic assistance, implementing a family medical plan, and other guidance on maintaining family stability. Another place, such as Taiwan, India and Japan, also implemented or is implementing the Family Planning Act to limit the family size. [A 14]\n\nIn China, in a certain sense, the family reflects its long history and cultural accumulation, built a very unique family form, and the Han nationality is more than generations. However, following the development of economy and technology, this traditional big family model is getting a small impact. Especially in the city, only the small families of the two generations and even generations have become more and more, and a family often has only three or four people. The freedom of marriage, the wife, the pair of men and women, and the old love has become a common concept. The French system is when other children are married and they are separated from home, there is still a son to live with their parents after marriage. The implementation of this plan is obviously very important to family stability, and it is the same regardless of the political and economic adoption. [A 14] [58] Civilization (English: Civilization, the word origin \"Civilis\", the \"Urbanization\" and \"Civilization\", which are \"divided into cooperation\"), which is any urban development, social layering, government form and communication Complex society (English: complex society) characterized by symbolic systems (such as text) [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]. It is also a state of advanced social and cultural development, as well as the process reaching this state. It involves a wide range of people, including national awareness, technical standards, etiquette norms, religious ideas, customs, and scientific knowledge. Civilization has a more dense population gathering, and has begun to divide the social class, which generally has a ruler elite and is dominated by the city and rural population. These people who are ruled are concentrated in agriculture, mining, small-scale manufacturing and trade in accordance with division of labor. Centralization focuses power and extends humanity to natural control. [9]\n\nIn humanology and archeology, civilization refers to some people living and have a considerable degree of cultural and economic development areas, such as two rivers civilization and Yellow River civilization. It is also possible to refer to a cluster similar to cultural, such as Christian civilization, Confucian civilization.\n\nCivilization is a kind of living habits and all derivatives extending. Biological morphology, social form, environmental ecologic mutual interleaving and collision produced by civilization.\n\nFor the judgment criteria in civilization, it is mainly the emergence of the city, the generation of text, and the establishment of the national system. The most important premise is the emergence of the city, that is, the crowd gathers, the city is a symbol of civilization. It is generally believed that the earliest civilization is probably [Source Request].\n\nThe sociologist Louis Henry Moore Moore divides social evolution into three stages of Savagery, Barbarism and civilization, with technical invention as the boundaries of each stage, he believes that the representative technical invention of civilization stages is the sound Systems and texts, but some scholars think that this is too narrow, thinking that it is not possible to use text to be used to enter civilization [10].\n\nCultural changes have a great role in the production of civilization. The changes in farming methods, the differentiation of labor, the ruling class, that is, the emergence of the central government and the emergence of social class is an important feature of civilization [Source Request].\n\nThere are many conjectures with prehistoric civilization, but they have not been recognized by the journal. However, left to future generations is just myths, as well as the lessons of disasters bring people's pain.\n\nDuring the 3500 BC, I was called an ancient civilization period.\n\nThe ancient civilization basically has a source of rivers and rivers [11]. Different periods often occupy different civilization, and are roughly divided into geographical environments:\n\nDuring this period 1000 to BC, many civilizations entered the prosperity period, and usually also known as classical periods.\n\nHow to appear in civilization, this is a very attractive topic for philosophers and anthropologists, so there is a lot of theories to explain their respective views. Most views of most views is that the emergence of central concentration is the starting point for civilization. Therefore, the emergence of central centralism has become a focus. But all theories cannot explain the origins of all civilizations, which can only apply to partial civilization.\n\nThe development of civilization promotes progress in human society, but also has a lot of problems. Such as health issues. There is also a problem of infectious diseases. In addition, conflicts between different civilizations, as well as the struggle within civilization makes war a very common problem. There is also a class between classes within civilization.\n\nsettle down The word cultural relics, the earliest is the best in China. \"Zuo Zhuan, the second year\" record, \"Ford, Zuo Wei, I have a number, the cultural relics are disciplined, the statement is, and the officials, the official, the official, I am afraid, I don't dare to discipline.\" Today It is called cultural relics that will have historical and artistic values \u200b\u200bleft in the past. But for the exact definition of cultural relics, the current journal has not reached a consensus.\n\nThe emperor and folk cultural relics in the Song Dynasty, Song Huizong himself is an artist, \"the\" archaeological \"of the Qi Lin is\" Archaeological \",\" Xuanhe Palace Expo \", all the Tibetans, for the size of the gift, 500 have\" [ 1]. Zhou secretly called Song Gaozong \"visit to seek book paintings, spare no effort ...\" showing Mai Tuo \"[2]. Mi \u82be \"is fine in identification, and the painting and painting of ancient utensils will be\" must have been \".\" The wind of playing in the middle of the Ming Dynasty. High-spirited \"all over Zhong Ding Yu,\" Painting and Calligraphy Post, Kiln Jade Play, Wen Room \"[3]. Shen Deyi \"\u658b \u658b \u9980\" wrote: \"Playing with good things, with ancient, but this is not. Yongle's \u7ea2, \u5fb7 \u4e4b \u4e4b \u4e4b \u4e4b \u4e4b \u4e0e... starting with one or two Ya, appreciating Mo, obscuring a good thing of Jiangnan good things, a great joy of Xin An Ear, \u66f0 \u767e, \u52a8 \u76f8.. \"Chen Mengjia and Wang Shiziang love collecting furniture [ 4]. In 1966, Chen Dynasty was committed to death, and the Hidden furniture was confiscated, and it was treasured by the Shanghai Museum. Wang Shizhen later edited \"Ming Furniture Rewener\", the title page print is: \"Mr. Chen Mengji is only in this book.\"\n\nThe cultural relic value generally includes the historical value, artistic value, scientific value and special commodity value of cultural relics. [7] The value of cultural relics is objective. But the identification of cultural relics is a subjective process. The value of cultural relics produces the role of cultural relics.\n\nThere are many standards for cultural relics, such as:\n\nCultural relics identification refers to identification of cultural relics, and selects the standardizer is the most basic method. By comprehensively summarizing standard equipment features, it is clear that its era characteristics and styles, thereby determining its value.\n\n[Edit in Wiki Data] The festival is a memorable day in life.  All ethnic groups and regions have their own holidays. Some festivals originate from traditional customs, such as East Asia's New Year, Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, Ching Ming Festival, Double Ninth Festival. Some festivals come from religion, such as Christmas, Easter, Buddha, etc. Some festivals come from commemoration for someone or some event, such as National Day, etc. There is also a statement that the international organization advocates, such as Labor Day, Women's Day, Mother's Day.  Over time, the connotation and celebration methods of the festival are constantly changing. The festival is often confused with holidays. In fact, most festivals have no statutory holidays. For example, some of the traditional festivals in China, such as the Shangyuan Festival, Tanawa is equal to the four sides of the country, and the Chinese three major holidays are holiday. The fiction is imagined in the art of fantasy and art. Such as: writers in the creation process, based on life logic, through imagination and match, create things that do not exist in real life, but affordable things.\n\nFiction often appears in different works, such as novels, plays, movies, moving comics, etc. In order to distinguish between the real life, the author will add \"this story is purely fictional\", \"if there is a realistic coincidence\", and it can also prevent unnecessary laws.\n\nIn some fictional works, it is not suitable for many real things, or the real life is not enough to support the background content of the work. For example, in the \"Fantasy Country\" in the famous children's literature \"Alice Dream Tour Xianjing\", there are many people who speak. Through this setting, the plot in the virtual work can be pushed very smooth, so these fiction settings are very important.\n\nSometimes authors will adapt in realities in content, such as reducing mice into Mickey mice, cats change to Dora a dream, etc.\n\nOn the other hand, some things in real life will have copyright issues. If it is mentioned in the content, it is likely to violate the law. Therefore, in order to save trouble, the authors usually set fictional scenes directly, and avoid reality and places into the story. For example, in the game Winning Eleven, because the work is not accessible to most copyright holder, most of the game, the team, even the name, the team emblem, the team emblem, etc. It is built in the form of a film. For example, Barclays Premier League uses ENGLISH Premier League, the European Champion League uses European Champion League, and the team's Axus is more images like North London Reds. Although this approach may make the game feel, it saves a lot of copyright costs for producers.\n\nHowever, all things use fictional settings, may make content convictions and topic, such as Gossra, the author will also arrange it to destroy the Tokyo Tower and Tokyo Dudu, if destroy is false buildings It is indeed that the shock is insufficient, so the fictional work also requires the right amount to set the real content to increase the inference.\n\nFictional roles may be realized in response to market reactions and practical needs, such as in some large exhibitions such as World Expo, the organizer will set some mascots, then build a series of scenarios. These virtual factors are realized. And Santa Claus is a representative of the \"Santa Association\", \"Santa Village\", etc. in reality, and the people who believe in Santa Claus \"dream come true . At present, it is a very common business behavior of fictional roles and scenes, because such products are often easily intimate.\n\nIn addition, some \"fiction settings\" used in the fictitious works can actually be intentionally implied or moving with the reality. The author will reality to the number, sometimes the effect of satiric disadvantages.\n\nThe fictional world is also known as an overhead world, a unreal world that is completely conceived by the author, including historical background, biological, race, religion, language, geography and even the universe, like JRR Tolkin's \"Rings\" series There is a fictional world.\n\nIt means that there is no existence in reality, and the country produced by people. Most of them appear in a literary work or a movie plot, but do not exclude the possibility of making a fictional country in a very small number of entertainment purposes.\n\nRefers to any character, personality mask and identity that appears only in a novel, anime. The process of creating roles and characters in the novel is called \"English: Characterization\".\n\nFor a part of the fictional set of artificial language, such as the language set in book or fictitious, the fictional language is the language set for a fictional world, and is usually more depth and in the fictional world associated with them. The reasonable performance is designed.\n\nIncidents, legends, myths, or weapons that do not exist in reality. The Qinglong, the \"Three Kingdom Romance\" in China 's classical novels, Zhang Fei, who holds the eight snake spear.\n\nFictional religion refers to a fictional religion, sect, or cult, more appears in science fiction, movies, etc., may also be spoof for some religions, such as flight surface; or belonging to network culture and netizens participating Spoof, such as spring brother. In a cognitive system, the symbol is an image of a certain meaning, which can be a graphic image, a text combination, or a sound signal, building modeling, and can even be a ideological culture, a charter. For example, \"=\" is an equivalent symbol in mathematics, \"Forbidden City\" is politically a symbol of the ancient Chinese imperial power. In general, the function of symbols is to carry and convey significance. [1] It has an extremely wide meaning, from the provisions or conventions.\n\nThe symbol has a concise, unity, and convenience. The use of symbols indicate that things are simple and clear, avoiding confusion caused by the shape of the things, avoiding chaos due to different language.\n\nFrom the perspective of communication, McLun is put forward in the book \"Understanding Media\" book. Information is a unity of symbols and meaning, symbols are external forms or substance carriers of information. Structure Language Search is defined in the \"Ordinary Language Tutorial\" as a referred to. [2] British scholar Temsy Hawke thinks \"Anything only exists independently, and is associated with another thing, and can be\" explained \", then its function is symbol.\" [3]\n\nSymbols that appear in human culture. Secondary culture (English: subculture), also known as culture or non-mainstream culture refers to a small culture of a certain mainstream culture.\n\nThe demonstration of subcompices may appear in facing things of things, attitudes, habits, beliefs and lifestyle, can be said to be a relative to mainstream cultural value, belief, which is also another special values \u200b\u200bthat are generated by mainstream culture. And behaviors, like different levels of different nature of countries, regions, skin tones, race, religion, gender, sexual, class, the rich, education, occupation, and age, have different cultures. Every society will have mainstream culture in the face of impact and changes in the face of subsequent culture, which may be a positive improvement of mainstream culture, or as a negative resistance for mainstream culture.\n\nMost of the culture is circulated by the group. With the identity and sharing of groups, these times are circulated as a common mainstream culture, and people living in society are not only only the value and norm of mainstream culture. Also from people living in people, they are affected by many cultures.\n\n\"Secondary culture\" can also be opposed to \"Pop Culture\", refers to the new entertainment of a small number of people. Such as jazz, rock music and hip hop, street dance, extreme sports, homes or ACG have been a niche culture, but through the promotion, it has become popular culture.\n\nWhether a emerging culture belongs to popular culture is often determined by the media exposure. After the popularity of TV, some cultures have been promoted by the media. For example, the band in Hong Kong in 1960 can only perform in a few places. By the 1970s, it began to enter the public vision, and now become a popular culture. In the 1990s, there was no cilian culture in the 2000s and failed to become mainstream culture. But not all novelty cultures have been promoted by the media, such as TV animations in the 1970s, are seen as children's entertainment, and this concept is deeply rooted, and animation is protected from varying degrees. For example, Hong Kong regards the animation theme song as a children's song (although many works do not have a child's style), there is a \"Ceremony of the Candus Golden Songs\" (2009 \"Animation Golden Song Concert\"). However, in the late 1970s, this set of works gradually be gradually reversed by the \"Cosmic Battleman and\" Luzhou Third \"and\" Motor Soldiers Too \". Animation (English: animation) is a visual residue of the naked eye (such as 16 per second) by timing, a series of plurality of stationary solid state images (frames) to move (such as 16 photos per second) The illusion - while mistakenly thinks of paintings or objects (picture) activities and their movie technology.\n\nThe method of making the picture, the most common is that hand-painted on paper or cellulin, other production methods also contains clay, models, paper couple, sand painting, computers, etc.\nDue to the advancement of computer technology, there are now many ways to use computer animation software, animations that are produced directly on the computer, or the use of computers in animation production, these have been used in a large number of commercial animations.\nUsually animation is produced by a large number of intensive and boring labor, even if it is currently working in computer animation technology, it is also true.\n\nThe word \"Animation\" animation is from the birthplace of the dynasty, the origin of French inventors, the French inventor, Emir Renault, \"Animated\", refers to an image. Later, people will adapt the books [Note 1], movies, electronic software, music videos, TV advertisements, original and post-system effects, and use animation technology production. The relevant workers in the animation industry are called \"animators\", which is a professional name for dynamic screen. However, animations are also widely used in all walks of life, such as film and television industry, technology, etc., and art and design.\n\n\"Anime\" from the Chinese is an independent name that is derived from the word \"animation\". About the 20th century to the 21st century network developed and secondary creation, using the splicing and other methods to reinterpret the title defined after their work. Later, \"Anime\" was also widely used by people from Hong Kong, Malaysia, Taiwan.\n\nThe word \"Anime\" is only frequently used in Chinese, because the translation is often mistaken to be synonymous with the animation. In today's network, TV, magazine and other media, this term has been widely used, but because some media misuse and demonization, the misunderstanding and controversy of these two vocabulary are also more and more.\n\nFrom civilization, humans use various image forms to record object action and time process.\n\nFrench archaeologist Puerto Horse (Prudhommeau) pointed out that the stone hole in the old stone era of 25,000 years ago, painted a series of bury bull run analysis, and the animals on the mural were superimposed. Multi-legged, used to express a decomposed action, is the earliest evidence of humanity attempt to capture condensation action with a pen (or stone).\n\nThe same example, continuous action exploded in the egyptian tomb, Greek ancient bottle appears. Draw the action that occurs at different times on a picture, this \"simultaneous\" concept indirectly shows the desire of human \"moving\". Leonardo Da Vinci's famous gold proportion of the four arms painted on the body geometry, indicating the movement of the hands up and down.\n\nAnother example is to discover the pottery pots of five drawings with goats in Iran. When you rotate the bowl, you can see that the goat jumps on a pear tree. This can also be considered an example of an early animation. However, in front of the device without a dedicated device, a separate action decomposition image cannot be referred to as an animation in the true sense.\n\nIn the history of Chinese painting, artists have always given a tradition of static painting to life, such as the \"six law\", the charm of the \"Liao Zhai\", \"Liao Zhai\", \"paintings\", the characters go out of the reel, etc. dynamic. True to develop a work that makes the picture on the picture, or is still in a distant Europe.\n\nEarly-prematured equipment included Feneri Miroscope, activity visual mirror (Praxinoscope, also translated into \"practical mirror\"), Hand over the sixteenth century, and China's early Western mirror (Zoetrope). Although these technical means can cause a continuous image to produce a visual effect similar to animation, the animation is not too great to develop before movie photography. Hand over the prototype of the book, this and the concept of animation also have communication.\n\nThe development of animation production technologies has benefited from the development of film photography technology in the 19th century. In this period, due to many people do, they can be classified as animation works, so it is difficult to find a separate person. , As a creation of film animations or inventors. But you can use the means they use to place them with a pioneer of some animation production technology.\n\nGeorg M\u00e9li\u00e8s is a creator for movie special effects, mixing Delivery animation techniques in his movie work. This technology is a great role in his shooting movie, and it has played a lot of effect on the advancement of the animation, and it is also used in a large number of special effects in early movies.\n\nThe oldest Delivery animation advertising movie is a short film in Arthur Melbourne Cooper, which is mixed with fixed animation techniques.\n\nJames Stewart Blackton may be the earliest animation technology in the US movie producer, as well as people hand drawn animation. His works, such as \"The Enchanted Drawing, 1900) combines drawings and videos; another work\" Humorous Phases of Funny Faces, 1906) is usually identified as the world's first Real animated works, and Bulleton is also considered to be the first real animator.\n\nEmile Cohl made a film \"Fantasmagorie\" in 1908, the film's visual style is similar to chalk painting, but it is actually drawn on paper with pencils. Some fragments in the film synthesize a realistic scene. This film uses the production technology that is later known as the traditional animation. The film first draws the plot on the paper, and then filled with each frame to the movie negative film, so the background of this film looks like a blackboard.\n\nIn subsequent time, more artists began to involve the animation field, including Wenr McKai, which is the inventor of detailed animation. This type of animation requires a number of animator collaboration because it takes a lot of time to pay attention to the details of the animation, and the background and roles of each frame need to be precisely heavy, while animation The role of the role is designed with animation. His most famous works have \"Little Nemo, 1911),\" Dinosaurry \"(1914),\" Sinking of the Luchenia \"(1918).\n\nThe first set of sound animations, Walt Disney's motor boat Willy. First set of animated long tablets, white snow princess.\n\nTraditional animation, also known as hand-painted animations, or celluloid animation, is a more popular animation form and production means. In the 20th century, most of the movie animations were made in the form of a traditional animation. Traditional animation expressions and technologies include full motion animation, limited animation (Limited Animation), transforming technology (ROTOSCOPING).\n\nSTOPMOTION is an animation form for the use of photographic techniques to be used in real items. Chinese can be called static animation, or still animation, etc. This animation can be divided into clay animation (CUTOUT Animation), a model animation, animation, and object animation, real movie animation (Object Animation), real movie animation (Object AniMation) Pixilation), Puppet Animation. There is another segment in these types. Delivery animation is different from traditional animation and computer animation, with very high artistic performance and very real material texture. When making, first perform photography, then change the shape position of the subject or replace the object, then perform photography, repeat this step until the end of this scene. Finally, these photos (film) are connected together to form an animation. This animation is also referred to as frame to frame or a postion to post.\n\nComputer Animation, is a technique for making animations with a computer. The popularity and powerful functional innovation of the computer has been produced and expressing the animation. Since computer animations can complete some simple intermediate frames, the production of animations is simplified, which only needs to make keyframes (KeyFrame) is known as \"Pose to Pose\". Computer animations also have a lot of form, but can be divided into two-dimensional animations and three-dimensional animations.\n\nTwo-dimensional animations are also known as 2D animations. Create a modification or editing animation with a computer 2D bitmap or a vector graphic. What is similar to traditional animation is similar. Many traditional animations have been transplanted to the computer. For example, gradient, deformed, onion ski technology, transform machine, etc. Two-dimensional movie animations have a very huge improvement in imaging effects, but the production time is shortened before. The current 2D animation often uses hand-painted and scanned to the computer or directly painted on the computer (considering costs, most of the two-dimensional animation company uses pencil hand drawn), then carry out the work on the computer Color work. Effects, sound music effects, rendering, etc., almost completely use computers. Some software that can make two-dimensional animations include Animate, After Effects, Premiere, etc., Disney began to make 2D animations in the 1990s. And they re-use the previous works.\n\n3D animation is also known as 3D animation. Performance based on 3D computer graphics. Some different animations, three-dimensional animations provide three-dimensional digital space to make animations with digital models. This technology is different from all previous animation techniques, giving the animator's greater creative space. The accuracy model, and the rendering of photos of photos have improved the levels of animations, which also makes it used in modern movies. 3D animation is almost completely dependent on computer production. When making, a large graphic computer work will vary depending on computer performance. 3D animations can achieve a variety of different final imaging effects through computer rendering. Includes realistic picture effects, and 2D animation hand drawn effect. The main production technology of three-dimensional animation is: modeling, rendering, light shadow, texture material, kinetics, particle effect (part 2D software can also be achieved), fabric effect, hair effect, etc. The famous 3D animation studios include Pickers, Blue Sky Studios, DreamWorks, etc. The software includes 3DS Max, Blender, Maya, LightWave 3D, SoftImage XSI, etc.\n\nComputer animation production technology has been greatly extended through a computer. Many technologies are not only used in animation, but also on TV, movies. These technologies include cartoon rendering animation, motion capture, color key, non-photorealistic rendering, skeletal animation, target deformation animation (Morph Target Animation), Simulation, Simulation, Simulated Wind, Rain, Thunder, Electric, etc.). In addition, there is a small animation made from bitmap or vector graphics, and the mainstream format on the Internet is a bitmap GIF.\n\nThe following mainly refers to Japanese animation and American animation industry. Animation production is very cumbersome and heavy work, and the division of labor is extremely meticulous.\n\nThe animation propagation media film industry is rarely produced by people of a country or company, but will be produced to other partnership countries, animation production companies, or to undertake orders. Therefore, the animated film industry is almost all cooperative manufacturing, unless the company is really enough to make the animation work.\n\nDesign department\n\nScript department\n\nDirection department (Direction Department)\n\nAnimation Department (ANIMATION Department)\n\nCG department\n\nArt department\n\nAudio Department\n\nImage department (Visual Department)\n\nDigital Film Mastering\n\nProduction issuance (Film development)\n\nPublicity\n\nMost of Japan and other countries have no big differences in learning, process and content with the United States, and the American animation industry.\n\nBefore the production, also known as the previous production:\n\nProduction:\n\nAfter the system, it is also known as later production:\n\nissued\n\nFor details, please refer to Animation Terminology. Comics (English: comics) is a two-dimensional visual static drawing art, composition (such as color, line) is generally streamlined than art paintings (such as oil painting, watercolor), can add text (such as white, next to, silent) Composition content. As in other art forms, comics can use different narrative methods, such as boast, ironic, realistic, etc. Traditional comics are generally serialized in magazines, or regularly issued a single line. With the development of digital technology and Internet technology, comics have more and more ways of e-books or website content. Continental comics constitute a plurality of static drawings, different from animations. Usually there is no sound, there is a sound example with \"VOMIC). Comics can completely describe things narrative stories, can express a complete story or concept itself, different from floating world paintings and illustrations. Comics more than simply presents scenery, so different from landscape painting, character painting, sketch, sketching. \"The word\" is a long, long-term meaning, such as a long, long, etc.; and simple, casual meaning, such as writing, stroll, etc. Therefore, \"comics\" can be seen as simulation and rigorous and rich in painting, such as oil painting, etc., and the painting style of narrative and scholars. Non-single comics can also be called a ring chart, with a comic painting.\n\nComics has experienced a development process as a painting, from the initial hobby of a minority, and has now become a common reading of people. Although the recent comics, it is 800 years ago, Japan has started the beginning of comics.\n\nEurope in the sixteenth century Renaissance has a similar comic work, like Li Audo Davenxi, starting to use exaggerated expressions, this is the sketch of the small paper, but the exaggerated painting, funny The performance, and started the comics of the Western Ocean [1]. Swiss painter Rudolf Top Buddha (English: Rodolphe T\u00f6pffer) in the 1830s of the company's origin of European serial comics [2].\n\nThe picture of the comics can be simple or complicated, and abstract can be realistic, but pay attention to the connotation of an idea or story. Although many of ancient ancient times is based on satirical humor, there are also historical stories (such as the painted character story of the northern Wei Sima Jinlong Tomb), the horror ghosts (such as the Hell of the Tang Dynasty, Wu Daoli's Hells), social issues and other different themes.\n\nPeople are familiar with the Roman Tula column, the appearance of the 190-meter relief, engraved the Roman Emperor Tura, in the 113th year of Xiyuan. The 11th century Bayi tapestry is 70 meters long, the wider is half a meter, and there is 62 meters. Describes the front and rear process of the entire Blackstins battle. It can be seen as a mode of early comics.\n\nAnd the ancient China also comics this artistic form. The Wu Liangtu stone carved \"Xia Wei\" in the 147th year of the Han Dynasty, the Han Dynasty, the Northern Wei Sima Jinlong Tomb unearthed, and the \"one group and gas\" made by Ming Xianzong Zhu Xiangxiang, Ming Dynasty and the early Qing Dynasty, eight major mountain people \"Peacock Map \"The Qing Dynasty\" Yangzhou Eight Blame \",\" rich can make ghosts to push mill \", etc., through the art leading expert test, all of which are ancient Chinese comics. Just in ancient China, the name of the painted model that gradually adapts to the painting form of comics is not \"comics\", but called \"satirical\", \"meaning\", \"almond\", \"color painting\", \"harmonics\" , \"Smile\" or \"funny painting\".\n\nAfter the inventions in the fifteenth century, the West may have comics, but usually with the artist William He Hagas in the 18th century chart of works A rake's progress is the earliest comics in the current Western history. This work has a spiriery, even like a drawn split script.\n\nThe Oriental is the first time the word \"four \u65f6 \u4ea4 \u4ea4\" in Japan's floating world painting. And Geji Behazhai is drawn, and Beizhai comics that will be published in 1814 may be comics this type in the east.\n\nModern comics can be traced back to the beginning of the 20th century, and Chen Shi, Qing Dynasty, was published in the \"Pacific News\" issued by Shanghai. [4], small shape, ink, ink, indifferent. However, due to the continuous war, most of the publications were lost during the war, it was difficult to see all works. Fortunately, Lu Xun, the \"Beijing Notes\" edited by Zheng Zhenzhen has collected some similar comic books similar to Chen Shi, in order to be a long rhyme of the early comics.\n\nIn May 1925, since the future generations of Feng Zikai, Feng Zikai, who was called the Master of Comic Master, published some paintings, and from the 172th issue of May, Mr. Feng, \"comics\" from the 172th issue of May. The words, this is the name of the comics first appeared in front of the Chinese public. Since then, Feng Zikai's paintings are popular in various newspapers with the name of \"Zikai Comics\".\n\nUnfortunately, comics will not be important in the history of modern painting in China.

In the first century BC, ASIA has become a name of an administrative province of the Roman Empire.\n\nThe Chinese translation of Asia was first named in 1582. After the missionary Mission of Jesuit came to China, with the help of the King of the King of the Kunyi, the translator was jointly formed \"Kunyi Wan Guo\" [4]. Since foreigners come in China when foreigners come to China, these translations have strong southern Chinese color. The beginning of the pronunciation is \"A\", \"A\", the end is translated into \"Asia\", and the foreign language is read more. When translating into Chinese, the translator will choose the pronunciation of Chinese characters in the local language. Chinese characters.\n\nAsian two river basins, India River-Gantheng Basin, Yellow River Basin is the development of human civilization, oriental business (about 1558 - about 1046), Zhou Dynasty (first 1046 - prior 256) and Western The Asian Empire of Meso Namia Civilization (first 934- July 605), the ancient Indian 16th and Xiongguang and the Dai Dynasty (the first 424 - first 322), the Kingdom of the Grand Iran (The first 678-553) and Persian (the first 553-334) were developed into a large-scale country, a large number of people in the territory.

India River plain. In the territory of the East Asia, the territory of the Sui and Tang Dynasty dynasty is also expanding to Central Asia and indifferent, and deeply affects the Korean Peninsula, Japan and Vietnam. Both are gradually become an emerging monarchy country. In the middle of the 8th century to the 11th century, South Asia's Indian Polo Dynasty is the last Indian dynasty as the last one with Buddhism; and the Juli Dynasty, the Juli Dynasty, which has gradually reached, and once accounts for Sumatra and Malay Peninsula.\n\nDolly Khan (546/552 - 583), the rise of the East Turk Kaben (583-630) and Xi Junji (583-658) did not cause the Asian political situation in the 6th century The little influence, followed by the rise of the Sui and Tang Dynasty and the rise of the Islamic Harley, the Tang Dynasty walked down the slope after the chaos of the Ai Shi, and the Toyo Khan (744-1840) and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (580-) In 877, it was more prosperous, which had a great impact on the East Asian political situation; the Tang Dynasty was in the name of Wang Xianzhi and the yellow nest of Wang Xianzhi and the yellow nest, and finally died in 907, the Liao Dynasty (Daddan) established by the Qidan At that time, the East Asian Political Bureau had a great impact.

In 1114, Jin Taizong, which was established by Yan Hao (1123-1135), successively destroyed the Liao Dynasty and Northern Song Dynasty. After 1127 Southern Song Dynasty, China once again appeared the situation in north and south. During the Song Jin Ding period, economic culture was restored. However, in 1206, with the rise and rapid expansion of the Mongolian Empire, conquer the vast number of Central Asia, East Asia, West Asia, Eastern Europe, but there are countless ancient civilizations in this process, and the overall civilization of the entire Asia is moving towards decline. .

After the Osman Empire, the Southeast Ou, the Middle East, the Soutya and North Africa, the Sudan (Emperor) of the Ottoman Empire, inherited the Lord of the World, inherited the Roman Empire and Islamic culture, things Civilization is integrated in its hands. The Ottoman Empire is located in the intersection of the things, and masters the land transport line of the things civilization for six centuries (1400-1922). In its existence, it is more than once, and it is impossible to implement Islamic and modern reforms, so that the boundaries of things civilization have become more vague.\n\nAfter Dongji, after four short-term ban on the ban, 1370, the Ming Taizu established the Ming Dynasty to carry forward this sea-ban policy. Although there is Zheng He's Western Yual, it will maintain a sea-ban policy. Although Ming Muzong Lung Qingqing Near China (1567 - 1572) Implementation of Open Sea, Ming Dynasty, and the economic and cultural exchange of East and West, the Qing Dynasty continued to ban the policy of catching the ban, and caused the shrinking of Eastern and Western economic and cultural exchanges and the stagnation of China's development.\n\nHowever, due to geographical discovery during the 16 to 17th century, Europeans have come to the Far East to develop trade and mission until the Japanese lock country, after 1723, East Asia is gradually closed. In Northern Asia, North Asia and Eastern Europe, with the tiles of Golden Towers, Moscow's big public, after the Ivan III, occupied Novgorod Republic in 1478, defeated the Khan Guowei (1219-1502) in 1480 (1219-1502) In the year), the shackles of the Mongol were all destroyed in 1502.

Before the Second World War, in addition to Japan, most of Asia countries and regions become colonial and semi-colonial land; they were directly occupied as a colonial Accounted for 2/3.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Asia became the test site of the Cold War. The national civil war, the Korean battle, the Vietnam War is the actor's war under the Mei Su. Asian countries have also begun to rebuild, military in China, successfully nuclear, economically Japan, South Korea and Taiwan's economic recovery under the US aid, and began to be highly developed. After the reform and opening up in 1978, China has become the world's second largest economy.\n\nThe colonies of the United States and the United States have independently, but in the Middle East Israel and the conflict in the Arab countries, the intervention of the British and American Soviet Union makes the situation since the Six-Pedica agreement. South Asia continued to be tight after India and Pakistan, due to the issue of religion and territories, and the two countries were fighting three times, and they had nuclear weapons launching capabilities.\n\nAsian geographies are very vast, in the north, the south extends to the south of the Equator, East, North, South, and three sides are on the verge of Pacific, Arctic Ocean and Indian Ocean, west and Europe, southwest and Africa, East, Brandy Brand North America is facing.\n\nBetween Asia and Europe usually use the Ural, Ural River, the Northwest Sea of \u200b\u200bthe Ural, the High Caucasus Swarfs, the Black Sea, Turkey, Aegean. The Twelve Islands of Greece, Northern Aiqinhai is close to Turkey's Aegean Coast, geographically, should be as asia. The Ural Mountains naturally extends to Vaiqi Island in the Arctic Ocean, and Xinji Island now believes that it belongs to Europe, in fact the Asian European lines in the south bank of Kara.\n\nAsia and African boundary lines are the Suez Canal. The Indian Ocean island Seychelles, Mauritius, and Comoros are all in Africa. Yekotra is close to Africa. Asian and Oceanian boundary lines are Weiber line or Riddi line, so Indonesia's Irian Kia is Oceania. The boundary line of Asia and North America is a white strait and a white sea. Each island is divided into two continents in accordance with the US, Russian jurisdiction [5].\n\nOverall, there are three characteristics of Asian terrain [6]:\n\nThe avenue movement of the Third Ji Ji is far from the influence of Asian terrain. Among them, the Eurasian sector and the Pacific plate collide, and the crust on the tape is pushed into the East Asian arc of the East Palace of East China, and it has made it a region in the world's earthquake volcanoes. The Eurasian continental plate is pushed by the Indian sector, forming a hidden papers of the new pleat mountain. The main mountain range is moving towards, the mountain is towering, the terrain is rugged, and is connected to the south of Asia. And mountain sandy plateau and basins, these places are also the birthplace of the Dahe. Siberia in northern Asia is a crystalline ancient plot, which is rich in metal mine, and the terrain is relatively flat. The hormones of the West Asia are dominated by the plateau, and the middle clamping the beauty of the Corosian in the bottom Gris River and the journal.\n\nAsia's main terrain units are:\n\nAsia's main features are complex and diverse climate types, and the monsoon climate is typical and continental. Sanzhong, temperature, hot three strips, and complex and diverse climates make the world's climate in Asia, all kinds of climate in Asia. East Asia Southeast Half of East Asia is a humid temperate and subtropical quarter wind climate zone, Southeast Asia and South Asia are wet tropical season wind climate, Central Asia, West Asia and East Asian inland for arid areas [6].\n\nThe difference in temperature in Asia is significant. The Malay Islands near the equator, such as summer, the average annual temperature is around 26 \u00b0 C. In the eastern part of Russia, the average temperature of 7 months in Russia, the average temperature is below 0 \u00b0 C, and there is a low temperature record of -71 \u00b0 C Oimikikang in the northeastern town, which is the cold pole of the northern hemisphere. [ 7].\n\nSignificant differences in climate also lead to a huge difference in precipitation in Asia. The annual rainfall in the desert area of \u200b\u200bCentral Asia is less than 100 mm, while in South Asia, the water in the wind reaches 3000 mm, the highest record is even 22,860 mm. The typhoon generated in the Pacific Ocean will also bring abundant rainfall in the eastern part of Asia.\n\nThere are two major characteristics of the Dajiang Dafa River in Asia. There are two main characteristics of the river network [6]: First, the rivers have originated from the central plateau mountains, and the ground is radialous to flow around; the second is that the internal flow area is large, such as the middle The Sier River and the Am River were infined in the salty sea, including the Arm River 2540 kilometers, which is the longest intraudio of Asia. Most of the rivers from the central mountain are eventually injected into the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean or the Arctic Ocean. Among them, there are 7 rivers and above, there are 7 rivers and the longest rivers are the Yangtze River.\n\nThe Richai in the western Asia is the world's largest lake. Lake Baikal is the largest freshwater lake in Asia. It is also the world's deepest, the oldest lake, the bottom of the lake is 1295 meters below the sea level. The Lisris River and the Children's River, the Yellow River, the Indian River Basin are the earliest civilizations. The Ganges is Holy River, Hindu and Buddhism. The Mekong River is an important international river, and the basin country includes the People's Republic of China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.\n\nAsia's natural resources are relatively rich, mineral types, large reserves, mainly oil, coal, iron, tin, tungsten, antimony, copper, lead, zinc, manganese, nickel, molybdenum, magnesium, chromium, gold, silver, rock salt, Sulfur, gem, etc. The reserves such as petroleum, magnesium, iron and tin are first in all continents, including more than 60% of the world's total reserves [7].\n\nThe total forest area of \u200b\u200bAsia accounts for 13% of the total area of \u200b\u200bthe world, part of Russia, the northeastern China, North Korea Democratic People's Republic of China, is a wide range of coniferous forests in the world, and has a lot of precious materials. . South Slope of China, Southwest, Japan Mountain, is particularly abundant, except for ordinary broad-leaved tree species, and palm, plaster, fir, flutter, etc. The tropical forests in Southeast Asia are an important position in the world forest, which is known for a constant, rich plant community. Its main tree species is the dragon brain, and there is a tree fern, ginkgo, and \u6d3b \u94c1, etc. [7].\n\nAsia's hydraulic resources are also relatively abundant. The development of hydraulic resources that can be developed can reach 26,000 billion degrees, accounting for 27% of the world's ability to develop hydraulic resources [7].\n\nAsia is the world's most populous, most dense continent, with a total population of 3672 million in 2000, accounting for 60% of the world's total population, with an average of 80 per square kilometers. There are more than 1,000 nationalities in Asia, accounting for about half of the total number of world nationalities [6]. The major nations are Mongolians (yellow people) and Caucasus (Caucasian), and there are a wide variety of people, including most of the language. At present, the population growth rate of East Asia has dropped to 1%, but the average growth rate of population growth rate in Southeast Asia, South Asia and West Asia is 1%.\n\nAsia's main nations include:\n\nIn ancient times, Asia has always been the center of the world economy. At that time, the world's major powers, such as China, India, Arab, and Persia (now Iran) were located in Asia. Asian farming industry can maintain most of the world's population. The main food producing area of \u200b\u200bthe EU's largest Empire Empire is also located in Asia.\n\nAfter the 18th Century Industrial Revolution, European capitalism raised, imperialism policies as other places as colonial expansion and plunder, most of Asia, America, Africa and Australia became European colonial or semi-colonial land. In addition to Australia and North America because local aborigines are almost completely destroyed, becoming a European world. Other Asia, Latin America and Africa have gradually independent in the Second World War, and the economy is also in a very backward situation. But in the second half of the 20th century, Asia is the most rising place in these original colonies. Japan first became among the world, for the first developed country in Asia, the Asian four small dragons (Republic of Korea, the Republic of China, China, Hong Kong and Singapore) have become the development of national or region at the end of the 20th century, and the economic rise of the People's Republic of China has Become Asia's largest economies, the world's second largest economies, second only to the United States. The rapid development of the Indian economy has made it a world's eye-catching place. Due to the large area of \u200b\u200bAsia, the difference in economic development in each region is large.\n\nAsian resources are absentized in Asia, including Bay Country Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Kuwait, Yemen and Iran, and in Indonesia, China, China, and Russia are also mainly producing oil. Asian part of mainland China and Russia is the highest in the world. Southeast Asia is the main supply of world hardwood and is also a region where tourism resources are rich. In addition to South Africa, the world's diamond production area is only an important part of the Asian part of India and Russia. Asia also includes almost all mineral resources with economic value.\n\nDue to the broad field of Asian, many nations, the diversity of culture is very strong, the difference is very large, and there is almost no unified \"Asian culture\". The three major religions of the world are born in Asia. After the ancient Greek decline, before the 18th century industrial revolution, due to the world's economic focus in Asia, most of the technical achievements of most human technology were produced in Asia. As early as 3,000 BC, Asian people have invented the burning pottery and smelting ore, Asia's Sume people first invented the text and system irrigation project, Central Asian nomad invented saddle, bow and arrow and wheels, Chinese Invented porcelain, gunpowder, compass, papermaking and carving printing, and plant rice. Indians and the Arab people invented the decisor computing technology. Asia's various local pharmaceutical technology even very effective today, but also in many areas.\n\nMany of the west and oriental instruments have the same origin, so they are very similar, such as violins and two Hu, guitar and \u7435\u7436, double arch tubes and \u5522\u5450, almost the same things. In fact, most of these instruments are originated in the Middle East.\n\nAsian national tourism has been very developed in recent years, mainly in the development areas and Metropolitan districts, including: China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Maldives, Thailand, India, Japan, Vietnam, South Korea, Saudi Arabia (including Mecca, UAE, Emirates, Qatar, Indonesia, Nepal, Bhutan, Iran, Pakistan, Turkey, etc.\n\nThe Asian Games is the largest, high-level comprehensive sports meeting in Asia, representing sports levels throughout Asia. It is the regional large-scale integrated sports meeting recognized by the International Olympic Committee, hosted by the Asian Olympic Council (Olympic Council), every four years. Its predecessor is the Far East Games and the West Asian Games. The first Asian Games were originally held in New Delhi in India in February 1949. Due to the preparations for the host country, it was held in 1951, and the 17th was held.\n\nAsia is divided into the following parts in geographical habits:\n\nEast Asia, it refers to the collectiveness of countries and regions in eastern Asia, with a double significance of geographic and cultural levels. Geography, it is the country and region of the Pacific Ocean in the north latitude of 20 degrees north to north to north to north to north. East Asia can be divided into three parts: Greater China, Northeast Asia and inland areas.\n\nSoutheast Asia includes Central South Peninsula and island in South China Sea and Pacific (collectively referred to as Malay Islands).\n\nSouth Asia includes the North of India to Xindukus Hill, as well as countries and regions in the north bank of the Indian Ocean.\n\nWest Asia is located in the west of Asia. It is a hub of contact Ya, Europe, non-Three continents and communication at the Atlantic, Indian Ocean, including Nankau Caucasus, Xiao Yawaia Peninsula (Anatolia), Iranian Plateau, Li Fante, Arabic Peninsula, Meso Damia plains and other areas. Asian part of West Asia and the Middle East overlap, but West Asia also includes Caucasus three countries.\n\nCentral Asia refers to the inland region of Asian Europe, usually in the five post-Soviet countries that are Tularan Plains to the Pamir Plateau.\n\nNorth Asia with Siberian concept overlaps, was jurisdiction in Russia.\n\nThe continents in the world have a large number of countries, second only to Africa. All territories are located in Asia, the largest and smallest countries are the People's Republic of China and the Islanda Maldives; the smallest countries in Asia are Lebanon.\n\nAsian countries are very complicated and are world hotspots.\n\nAt present, most of the international concern hotspots are also in Asia:\n\nRegional cooperation in Asia is in the ascendant, now the most promising places in regional cooperation are 10 Member States in Southeast Asia, Southeast Asian countries: Wen Rui, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. The total area is about 4.5 million square kilometers, with a population of about 512 million. There is also an observer country: Papua New Guinea. ASEAN countries have started the three East Asian countries of the People's Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, and established China-ASEAN Free Trade Area in 2010 and the People's Republic of China. The current People's Republic of China has started to start fruit and vegetables in Thailand. mechanism. The regional comprehensive economic partnership agreements jointly participated by the People's Republic of China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and the ASEAN have also participated in the regional comprehensive economic partnership agreement have also signed in 2020.\n\nSouth Asian countries are also tightening the organization, Pakistan and India's relationship between the organization, Pakistan and India.

It is also the main area of \u200b\u200bpopulation second continents and third world countries.\n\nAfrican climate is a treasure of ecological resources and mineral resources, and is also one of the birthplace of ancient humans and ancient civilization. At present, the oldest human fossil in the world is found in East Africa, and Egypt in northern Africa is one of the world's civilization.\n\nThe total area of \u200b\u200bAfrica is approximately 30 million square kilometers, which is the world's second continent only in Asia. Africa is still divided into two in the equator, and at the same time, it is in the east, west, south, and north hemisphere. The north of the north of the north and the north of the continents is almost equal.\nThe Northeast of Africa has a 163-kilogram Suez Canal, making it separated from Asia [6] (geopolitical politics, sometimes the Egyptian Sinai peninsula in the East of Suez can also be considered part of Africa); the north is the Mediterranean And Europe with it from it.\n\nThe terrain of Africa is dominated by a plateau. It is called \"highland continent\" in the plateau area, and the plateau of 500 ~ 1000 meters above sea level accounts for more than 60% of the total area. The southeast has an Ethiopian Plateau, East Africa Plateau from the south. Among them, the Ethiopian plateau has more than 2500 meters, known as \"African Rock\". Only the mainland has a high mountain range in the northwest and southeast of the mainland. Africa is also distributed in many basins, such as the Equatorial Congo Basin, is a typical big basin. There is also a large area in the western coast [5] [7].\n\nThe East African Rift Valley in the eastern Africa is the longest rift belt on the world. The Sahara Desert located in northern Africa is the world's largest desert, accounting for about 1/4 of the total area of \u200b\u200bthe country.\n\nFrom Africa's most northern Posea, the top of Tunnesia (37 \u00b0 21 \"north latitude 37 \u00b0 21 ') to the most southern point of the Eagles of Eagles, South Africa (34 \u00b0 51'15\" in South, Distance 8,000 kilometers. (Often misunderstanding the most southern end for a good angle) [8] From Africa in Senegal's highest point Cape (West 24 \u00b0 33'22 \") to the most east point of Harbay in Somalia (East 51 \u00b0 27 \"52\"), the distance is about 7400 kilometers. [9] The coastline of Africa is about 26,000 kilometers long, as the coastline of the mainland is relatively straight, so the length of the coastline is not assessed only for one-third of the European (European coastline long) About 32,000 kilometers). [9]\n\nThe area of \u200b\u200bAfrica 3/4 is distributed in the south, and the northern returns line, the equator is more wearing it, and the average temperature in the ANA is about 20 \u00b0 C above 20 \u00b0 C, which accounts for 95%, and more than half of them is hot. There are nearly half of the area with hot warm seasons and warm cold seasons. The climate is generally warm, and it is characterized by high temperatures, less rain, dry, and climatic belt distribution in north-south symmetrical. The equator is in the center, and the climate is generally lowered from the equator. The average temperature in Dalolol in Northeast Ethiopia was 34.5 \u00b0 C, one of the highest average temperatures in the world. Aziji, south of Libya, Tribaya, September 13, 1922, measuring the temperature above 57.8 \u00b0 C, which is the highest temperature in Africa. Kilimanjaro is near the equator, but due to high sea level, the top of the mountain is snowing in the end of the year [7].\n\nAfrican climate is mainly divided into five districts:\n\nAfrica's precipitation distribution is unbalanced. Near the Equator and Guinea Bay are one of the most abundant precipitation in the world, and there are few precipitation in the tropical desert climate zone on both sides of the north and south. Africa is the largest continent in the world's arid area [5].\n\nA large variety of mineral resources in Africa, large reserves. Reserves and production of diamonds, gold, chromium iron, phosphate, etc. are in the forefront of the world. African animal and plant resources are also extremely rich. African plants have at least 40,000 or more. The forest area accounts for 21% of the total Africa area. All continents are rich in mahogany, ebony, rosewood, ciba, ebony, eucalyptus, \u6832 tree, walnut, yellow paint wood, plug skin, etc. The grassland is vast grassland, accounting for 27% of Africa, ranking first in various continents. The type and quantity of large-scale wild animals in Africa ranks first in the world [7].\n\nThere is a rich natural landscape in northern Africa. It is also the world's largest desert. It is also the world's largest desert. The area is also larger than Australia; there is also the world's first large Nile, long is 6852.06 km [5] .\n\nThe African population is about 1.2 billion. The current fertility is very high, and the population birth rate of Saharan Africa is still maintained at 4.6, and the United Nations and NGO have warned that no population growth will face a great difficult situation in the future. [10]. It is predicted that the African population will be three times in 2100, reaching 3.1 billion, or even 5.7 billion people [11].\n\nThe African ethnic groups are dominated by a black ethnicity of a high-semester, including Niger, and Nigero, Ban Tuas.\n\nThe former is distributed in the north and the latter is home from the south. And the gap between the two is quite large. Although the northern Islamic area is a desert, the northern Arab countries entered the stable development from the Western independence, using oil-selling funds to complete the industrialization of society, and have appropriate political conditions, rule of law Education, basic construction, etc., recently started to launch tourism (such as Egypt), driving Islamic democratic movement and other.\n\nHowever, due to the high fertility rate, the cultural and malnutrition, the cultural level, the level of education and cultural level, the general population is generally low, and the development is slow, although all localities have rich minerals, such as gold, copper, iron , Manganese, uranium and non-metallic ore oil, etc., but only a few partially effectively developed, the meager profits of selling minerals have been diluted with the gap between the rich and the poor, and the past belongs to European colonies, the economic structure is not perfect. Because political corruption is still not improved; if the natural environment is bad, it is not too dry to be too wet, and many small national politics have not stabilized, and the public security of drugs, the black gun robbery is rampant, and the racial complexity is caused by the country of China. It is generally in poverty.\n\nThe African language is mainly 4 languages:\n\nWith the invasion of European colonial countries, most African countries use other languages \u200b\u200boutside Africa as official languages, but there are also local languages, such as Swahili is used as the official language of African countries. In Africa is widely used in Arabic, French, English, Portuguese, South Africa, and Madagascaries, etc., which belong to the flash system, Indo-European and South Island.\n\nAfrican foreign religion is Jewish and Christianity. Byzantine era Egypt, Nubia (now the Republic of Sudan), Akssum (now Ethiopia) is a regional belief in Christian, the Abu Miki Church of Egyptian Alexander and the Sinai Peninsula Monastery is loaded into the World Cultural Heritage List The ancient Christian remains, located in Tagaste City in the Today's Algeria is the hometown of Christine Master Augustine.\n\nAfter the rise of the AR, the Arab Arab Arab is rising under the banner of Islam, Northern Africa and East Africa quickly have been fought in the Arabian Peninsula, and the Byzantine Empire of the Byzantine Empire, who is hurt in the long-term hurt of Sassan, and is unable to resist Muslims. Conquer the tide, Egypt, Magiib, Nubia, etc. have gradually Arabic and Islamic, only in Egypt, only in Egypt, and believe in Christian Ethiopia has become a fruitful Christianity.\n\nThe ambition of the Muslim conqueror did not stop in North Africa, and the Arabian military continued to promote the south to the south to the black people, and the Arab businessmen came to East African islands and coastals through navigation. Even after the Arab Empire collapsed, after disintegration, Islam spread in Sahara and Sahel zone, the pace of communication has never stopped, the most powerful black country in ancient history - West Africa's Mali and Sanhai Empire are devout ambassador And to foreign mission.\n\nAfter the opening of the new route, the European colonists re-brought the Christianity to Africa and decided in Africa for nearly 1,000 Christianity recovery. In the 16th century, Portugal established a missionary base in West Africa. In the 17th, 18th century, the Netherlands immigrants introduced the new teach Karlin into the southern Africa. In the late 19th century, European powers set off the African frenzy, Portugal, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Italy, France, and the United States and other Western countries entered African mission under the support, while West Africa's Haosa people were previously launched. Seventy-decade (1804-1874) Islamic Jihadi also entered an end with Muslim victory, forming a situation in Christianity and Islam and Islam in the West Africa.\n\nAfrican Islamic and Christianity, the forces of the original religion is roughly 12 degrees in the division of 12 degrees in the north latitude. African countries north of Northern African countries are Muslim countries, and the Northern African countries (regions) in the north latitude are in addition to Guinea. Somali, Djibouti, Comoros, Sanjibabal Islam did not account for absolute advantages.\n\nWithin the scope of Christianity and the original religion, the Christian forces is large, and the countries with more devout people teach people have the equatorial Guinea, Uganda, Botswana, Lesotho, South Africa. The former British colonies in Africa are more believed in Christ, while France, Belgium, and Portugal, the pre-colonial colonies will pay more attention to Catholicism.\n\nNigeria, Ethiopia's Christians and Muslims roughly each, the number of Muslims in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, but unable to occupy the advantage, Nigeria's Bo Sheng, Somalia's major black Muslim extreme terrorist organizations for Africa. Uganda's Holy Spirit Army is the largest Christian terrorist organization in Africa. In Uganda, I have happened to the Christian Extreme Party \"Restoring God Ten Commandment\" incitement of hundreds of believers collective self-immolation. The Qinban Ancient Conference is a new religion of Christianism and African traditional beliefs in the Congo Basin.\n\nThe African Unified Organization was established on May 25, 1963. Under the host of Mubeki, the last chairman, was renamed the African Union on July 9, 2002. The purpose of African Unified Organization is to unite African countries to form a unified voice representing African countries. Opposing colonialism, establishing an STUG helped Africa to conduct independent movements.\n\nIn July 2002, the African Union was established in South Africa. Including 55 African Member States Integration Unified Organizational Unified Organizations, AU is a pleasant political entity that is integrated with political, economic and military. The African Union has a planned uniform use currency, joint defense forces, and established a cross-state legislative administrative organ, including a civil cabinet government that manages African Union. The main purpose of this alliance is to help develop and stabilize African democracy, human rights, and the economy that sustainable development, in addition to reducing armed warfare in Africa and creating an effective common market. On July 2, 2007, Libya leaders, Kadafi, in the African Union Summit held in Accra, Ghana, held an alliance.\n\nLong-term racial conflict and tropical diseases, industrialization caused by environmental damage, in the past, the western colonialism, independent corruption regime, education, people self-discipline, so that Africa has become the lowest in the world. According to the United Nations, the human development report published in 2009, 22 of the lowest in the human development index, two of which are African countries (159th to the 182th).\n\nUnder a large number of investment and counseling, China, India and Latin American economy rapidly grow millions of people to get poverty, but Africa is slower than other regions in other regions. Poverty in Africa has a very serious problem, including low per capita expectancy (Swazili expects less than 33 years old), violence.\n\nSome areas of Africa, especially Botswana and South Africa, and the economic development is relatively successful. The former more than 4-point fiscal budget is used to improve the infrastructure of the capital, Haboene, making it one of the fastest growing cities in the world. The latter has rich natural resources, and the perfect Western system, one of the most important gold and diamond producing countries in the world. Other countries such as Gana, Kenya, Garn, Cameroon and Egypt, many of the releared tourism and petroleum industry, so the public security and infrastructure established in foreign assistance has reached a certain extent, and the economic development is also ideal.\n\nAgriculture is an important sector of an African economy. The corn cultivation in grain crops is the most growing area, is the staple food of rural residents; wheat and rice output cannot be self-sufficient, it takes a lot of imports. The economic crops for export mainly have coffee, cocoa, peanuts, cotton and swords. [5].\n\nThe mining industry and light industry are the main departments of the African industry. Gold, diamond, iron, manganese, apatite, aluminum mine, copper, uranium, tin, oil, etc. have an important role in the world. The light industry is processed with agricultural and animal products and textiles. The wood industry has a certain foundation and the material is more. Heavy industry has metallurgy, machinery, metal processing, chemistry, cement, marble, diamond, rubber products, etc. [7].\n\nFrom 1995 to 2005, Africa regaled economic growth, with average of 5% in 2005, and some countries that have just started to develop petroleum resources, such as Angola, Sudan and Equatorial Guinea more than 10%. However, Africa's advancement has a gap in other countries.\n\nAfrica is full of fatal viruses such as malaria, dengue fever, Ebola, cholera, AIDS, encephalitis, etc. Its main reason is usually due to the lag of sanitary conditions and many local primitive viruses. In addition, human beings are also preded by animals with latent viruses. Through wounds, blood contact, water source and other factors are largely propagated, the source of viruses has been said. When these viruses spread, there are also scholars [Who? ] Point out that these viruses may be due to the fall of meteorite falling in hundreds of millions, and the virus in space invaded the Earth, so it ultimately leads to these deadly viruses to be spread, so that humans have always found a way to solve these viruses. [Source Request] Scholars pointed out that these viruses may be in vivo lurking in some animals, and these viruses have gradually contagiously infected people with humanity and destroying nature for these animals.\n\nAfrica has splits many countries after the Second World War, which is the largest in the world.\nThe largest and smallest countries in Africa are Algeria and Island Seychelles; [16] The smallest country in Africa is Gambia.\n\nAfrican Football League (CAF) Official Website (Fiction) (English)\n\nAfrican (Africa)\n\nAntarctica\n\nAsia Asia (Asia)\n\nOceania (Australia)\n\nEuropa (Europe)\n\nNorthern Meitacine (North America)\n\nSouth Asia Mergania (South America)\n\nEurasian non-continent\n\nArmeliqia (America)\n\nEurasia\n\nOceania\n\n \n\nSubmerged continent / land\nKelgalan Haitai \u00b7 Zilang Continent \u00b7 \u5dfd \u5dfd \u53e4 \u9646\n\nSuper continent that may be formed in the future\nUltimate Plant Ancient Continental \u00b7 Aestian Continent \u00b7 New Pan Ancient Continent\n\nmyth Continent with guess\nKumari Candidam (English: Kumari Kandam) \u00b7 Remlia Continental \u00b7 Mc \u9ea6\u666e\u65af \u5927\u9646 (English: Meropis) \u00b7 Mi Jimland \u00b7 Unknown Southern Continental \u00b7 Atlantis \u8bb8\u73c0 \u8033 \u8033 \u4e9a \u4e9a\n\n\n\nAsia\n\nEast Asia Southeast Asia \u00b7 South Asia Central Asia, Saina / Southwest Asia / Siberia Northeast Asia\nOthers: Near East \u00b7 Middle East \u00b7 Far East \u00b7 East Asia Arc East India \u00b7 India\n\n\n\nAfrica\n\nCulture Geography: Arab Africa \u00b7 Black Africa (Latin Africa)\nNatural Geography: Northern Africa / Saharan Africa Sahara South Africa (Eastern Africa \u00b7 Central Africa \u00b7 Western Africa \u00b7 Southern Africa)\nOther: Northeast Africa, Northwest Africa, large Middle East\n\n\n\nEurope\n\nNatural Geography: Eastern Europe, Western Europe, South Ou, China, Other: Southeast Europe / Balkan, Europe\n\n\n\nAmerica\n\nNatural Geography: North America \u00b7 South America Political Geography: North America \u00b7 Latin America (China (Central American \u00b7 Caribbean) \u00b7 South America) Culture Geography: Angulus America / English Masseari, Latin America (Iberia, Spanish) \u00b7 \u00b7 Central America\n\n\n\nOceania\n\nAustralia: Australia, Macau, Miranecia, Micronesia, Polynesia\n\n\n\nPolar\n\nArctic Place \u00b7 Antarctica / Antarctic place\n\nOther\n\nHolland Area / Asia Pacific \u00b7 Independent National Association, Arab Region \u00b7 Ring Medal, Caucasus\n\n\n\nOcean\n\nWorld Ocean \u00b7 Pacific \u00b7 Atlantic \u00b7 Indian Ocean \u00b7 Arctic Ocean \u00b7 South Ocean\n\n\n\nClimate zone\n\nTropical: Tropical Rainforest \u00b7 Tropsterus \u00b7 Tropical Prairie \u00b7 Tropical Desert \u00b7 Tropical Monsoon\nSubtropical: subtropical moist / summer rain type warm and humid side tropical monsoon\nTemperate: Temperate Marine \u00b7 Temperate Continental \u00b7 Temperate Mediterranean \u00b7 Temperature Tempera \u00b7 Temperature Zone Desert \u00b7 Temperature\nSub-temperate tape:\nCold zone: Polar Climate \u00b7 Vice Patent Climate (Moss Climate \u00b7 Iceland Climate)\nPalace:\nOther: Alpine Climate \u00b7 Hilly Climate \u00b7 Plain Climate \u00b7 Basin Climate \u00b7 Taiwan Climate\n\n\n\nBiological distribution area\n\nNew North Territory \u00b7 Gu Beiji \u00b7 Ethiopia, Dongyang Dynasty, Australia, New Territories, New Tropical, Antarctic Oceania (English: Oceania) refers to geographic regions of geographic politics in geographical politics in Australia and Pacific; Oceania is not a \"continent\", accounting for 6% of the world's total land area.

Compared with the continents, Oceania's land area is the smallest; the population is less, only more than Antarctica.\n\nAustralia indigenited Australia has settled in Oceania at 4,000 to 125,000 years ago. Fiji has settled in the South Island nation or Polynesia in 1800 AD, then colonized the remaining islands in 1000 AD. [1]\n\nOceania and Asia are bound in the Papua region of Indonesia. Including Indonesia's Papua region, Papua New Guinea, Australia, New Zealand and South Pacific Island Country. Papua New Guinea is the only Oceania Countries in the terrestrial borders of the country, bordering Asian countries in Indonesia. According to the geographical boundaries, Oceania includes the Malay Islands in Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, Malaysia, East Timor and Brunei. However, geopolitical concepts are divided into new Guinea island, Western Indonesia, Sibbler, Papua, Eastern China. Papua New Guinea Independence National Development Oceania. This concept is adopted by international organizations such as the United Nations Organization, the International Olympic Commission.\n\n\n\nOceania has more than 35 million people. The following is a list of population arranged in a population density per square kilometer.

The East is from the Atlantic, the West, the Pacific Ocean, and the south of the Panama Canal is divided into South America. North America also includes many islands in the Caribbean Sea (mainly the West Indies). North America is 242.28 million square kilometers (including nearby islands), accounting for 16.2% of the total land area of \u200b\u200btoday's land, is the world's third continent. The population is 51.8.72 million (July 2008), ranking 4th in the world.\n\nAbout 10,000 years from 40,000 years ago, human beings arrived in North America at the last ice of the ice (now the location of the Branda Straits). The earliest arrival is called ancient indiars. After the arrival of the Americas in 1492, North American aborigines began to contact Eurasian mainland civilization. Today, North America's race and culture reflect the European colonists, North American indigenous, African slaves, and their offspring between their descendants. The northern part of North America is strongly affected by the European colonists, while the southern is relatively more affected by the Aboriginal and African Cultural. Affected by the European colonists, most North American residents speak English, French or Spanish\n\nThe mainland coastline is about 60,000 kilometers long. The northern section of the west, the north and the eastern coast is more twists and turns, multi islands and the fjord; the south half coast is flat. The total area of \u200b\u200bthe peninsula is approximately 2.1 million square kilometers. The total area of \u200b\u200bthe island is about 4 million square kilometers, ranking first in all continents, of which Greenland is the world's largest island.\n\nThe provinces and hills account for about 42% of the total area, with a plateau and mountains of more than 500 meters above an altitude, accounting for about 58%, with an average altitude of about 700 meters. The basic feature of the mainland terrain is that the mountains in the north and the south are distributed parallel to the coast, and the large plains are distributed in the middle. The terrain is obviously divided into three districts:\n\nThe North River is the Labrador Plateau, south of the Apalacian Mountains, the terrain is low, and the altitude is generally 300 ~ 500 meters. There is a narrow coastal plain along the Atlantic on the east side of the Apalacia, and the west side gradually declines with the central plain.\n\nLocated between the Labrador Plateau - Abarachia Mountains and the Rocky Mountains, Northern Hudson Bay, south to Mexico, in the middle of the mainland. Many lakes and rapids in the top of the plains, southern, gains to the river plains. The western part of the plain is a famous large plain of the world.\n\nIt is the northern section of Ciderra, from Alaska to the south of Mexico, mainly including three parallel mountains, from east to west: Rocky Mountains, Alaska Mountains - Canada Coast Mountains - Kasakarten - Nevada Mountains, West Coastal Islands in Western Canada - US Coast Mountains, where Di Na Life in the Alaska Mountains is 6,194 meters above sea level, which is the highest peak in North America. There is a plateau and a basin between the Eastern Mountain and the central mountain, and the Diovasium in the National Park of Death Valley National Park in California is the lowest point in North America.\n\nNorth America across tropics, temperate, cold belt, and climate complex. Since all the mountains are all in the north and south or approximately north-south, the wet air coming from the Pacific is only in the western coastal area; the cold air from the Arctic Ocean can pass through the central plain; the wet air blown from the tropical Atlantic Ocean can also pass through the central plain. Going deep into the north, so the climate in North America is very unstable, sometimes cold in winter, sometimes warm, the subtropical region along the Gulf of Mexico, will also happen in winter.\n\nThe outer stream of North America accounts for approximately 88% of the area of \u200b\u200bthe capital, of which the 48% area of \u200b\u200bthe Atlantic watershed accounts for about 48%, and the Pacific Waters is about 20%. In addition to the St. River, all the rivers originate from the Rocky Mountains. The rivers in the Rocky Mountains have flowed into the Atlantic Ocean and the Arctic Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean is injected in the west river. The internal flow area (including no flow zones) accounts for about 12% of the acrian area, mainly distributed in the Western American Basin and Greenland.\n\nThe Mississippi River is the largest river in North America, which is the fourth largest river in length. Important rivers are: horse growing rivers, Yukon River, St. River and Grand River. On the river in North America, the largest waterfall is about 700 meters away from Diagara Falls, which is 51 meters away from the Niagara Falls and 1240 meters wide.\n\nNorthern American lakes, the total area of \u200b\u200bfresh water lake is about 400,000 square kilometers, and the first place in all continents. The lake is mainly distributed in the northern half of the mainland. Five Lakes in the central plateau: Lake Subury, Lake Humen, Michigan, Lake Ill, And Ontario, with a total area of \u200b\u200b245,273 square kilometers, is the world's largest freshwater lake group, with \"North American Mediterranean\". Among them, the Lake Subury is the world's largest freshwater lake.\n\nThe distribution of all-wide population is unbalanced, most of the population is distributed in the southeast and southwestern part of the region. The population is rare in the northern region and the inland region of the United States, and some are even in place. Residents are mainly descendants from European immigrants, including the largest Anglo-Saxon, followed by black, Indians, mixed, and a few Jews, Japanese and Chinese. Mainly believe in the New Teachers and Catholicism. General English and Spanish.\nThere are 8 metropolitan regions in 10 people in North America in the United States.\n\nFigure Figures Are 2011 Census Figure.\n\nAccording to the statistics of the International Monetary Fund 2016, the per capita GDP in North America is $ 41,830, which is the world's highest in China.\n\nBoth Canada, Mexico and the United States have prosperous and diverse economies. The United States is the largest economy in these three countries, and is also the world's largest economy now (2018). According to the statistics of the World Bank, the 2018 US per capita GDP (purchasing force evaluation) reached 57,466 US dollars. The first, second and tertiary industries in the United States accounted for 1.2%, 22% and 77% of GDP. Canada has high-speed services, mining and manufacturing. Canada's per capita GDP (purchasing force evaluation) is estimated to be $ xx, which is the 11th largest economy in the world. The first, second, and tertiary industries of Canada account for 2%, 20% and 80% of the GDP. Mexico is the 15th largest economy in the world. As an emerging industrialized country, Mexico is complicated with traditional industrial and agriculture. Its main revenue comes from oil exports, manufacturing, electronics, heavy industry, cars, buildings, food, banking and financial services. The economy in North America can be divided into three areas: North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), with Caribbean Community and common markets (PDD $ parties), and Central America (CACM). In addition to these large-scale trade agreements, there are still many other national trade agreements.\n\nThere are 23 countries in North America, two of which are located in North America, 8 in Central America (United Nations Geographic Program), part of Mexico as part of Central America [2]), 13 in the West Indian Islands.\n\nIn addition, North America has 22 well-independent overseas territories, which belong to the UK (6), France (6), Netherlands (6), US (3) and Denmark (1), which is affiliated with France Pinton and Nava Siza in the United States are uncommon living in the island.\n\nAll of North America is listed below and its genus:\n\n\n\nAsia\n\nEast Asia Southeast Asia \u00b7 South Asia Central Asia, Saina / Southwest Asia / Siberia Northeast Asia\nOthers: Near East \u00b7 Middle East \u00b7 Far East \u00b7 East Asia Arc East India \u00b7 India\n\n\n\nAfrica\n\nCulture Geography: Arab Africa \u00b7 Black Africa (Latin Africa)\nNatural Geography: Northern Africa / Saharan Africa Sahara South Africa (Eastern Africa \u00b7 Central Africa \u00b7 Western Africa \u00b7 Southern Africa)\nOther: Northeast Africa, Northwest Africa, large Middle East\n\n\n\nEurope\n\nNatural Geography: Eastern Europe, Western Europe, South Ou, China, Other: Southeast Europe / Balkan, Europe\n\n\n\nAmerica\n\nNatural Geography: North America \u00b7 South America Political Geography: North America \u00b7 Latin America (China (Central American \u00b7 Caribbean) \u00b7 South America) Culture Geography: Angulus America / English Masseari, Latin America (Iberia, Spanish) \u00b7 \u00b7 Central America\n\n\n\nOceania\n\nAustralia: Australia, Macau, Miranecia, Micronesia, Polynesia\n\n\n\nPolar\n\nArctic Place \u00b7 Antarctica / Antarctic place\n\nOther\n\nHolland Area / Asia Pacific \u00b7 Independent National Association, Arab Region \u00b7 Ring Medal, Caucasus\n\n\n\nOcean\n\nWorld Ocean \u00b7 Pacific \u00b7 Atlantic \u00b7 Indian Ocean \u00b7 Arctic Ocean \u00b7 South Ocean\n\n\n\nClimate zone\n\nTropical: Tropical Rainforest \u00b7 Tropsterus \u00b7 Tropical Prairie \u00b7 Tropical Desert \u00b7 Tropical Monsoon\nSubtropical: subtropical moist / summer rain type warm and humid side tropical monsoon\nTemperate: Temperate Marine \u00b7 Temperate Continental \u00b7 Temperate Mediterranean \u00b7 Temperature Tempera \u00b7 Temperature Zone Desert \u00b7 Temperature\nSub-temperate tape:\nCold zone: Polar Climate \u00b7 Vice Patent Climate (Moss Climate \u00b7 Iceland Climate)\nPalace:\nOther: Alpine Climate \u00b7 Hilly Climate \u00b7 Plain Climate \u00b7 Basin Climate \u00b7 Taiwan Climate\n\n\n\nBiological distribution area\n\nNew North Territory \u00b7 Gu Beiji \u00b7 Ethiopia, Dongyang Dynasty, Australia, New Territories, New Tropical, Antarctic\n\nAfrican (Africa)\n\nAntarctica\n\nAsia Asia (Asia)\n\nOceania (Australia)\n\nEuropa (Europe)\n\nNorthern Meitacine (North America)\n\nSouth Asia Mergania (South America)\n\nEurasian non-continent\n\nArmeliqia (America)\n\nEurasia\n\nOceania\n\n \n\nSubmerged continent / land\nKelgalan Haitai \u00b7 Zilang Continent \u00b7 \u5dfd \u5dfd \u53e4 \u9646\n\nSuper continent that may be formed in the future\nUltimate Plant Ancient Continental \u00b7 Aestian Continent \u00b7 New Pan Ancient Continent\n\nMythology and guess continent\nKumari Candidam (English: Kumari Kandam) \u00b7 Remlia Continental \u00b7 Mc \u9ea6\u666e\u65af \u5927\u9646 (English: Meropis) \u00b7 Mi Jimland \u00b7 Unknown Southern Continental \u00b7 Atlantis \u8bb8\u73c0 \u8033 \u8033 \u4e9a \u4e9a South Asia Mergence (Spanish: Sudam\u00e9rica or Am\u00e9rica del Sur; Portuguese: Am\u00e9rica Do Sul; French: Am\u00e9rique Du SUD; English: South America; Dutch: Zuid-amerika; word source: Amei Give Visphi) It is referred to as South America, one of the seven continents, located in the south of the West Hemisphere (or the southern Hall), the western South Pacific, the west is the Pacific sector and the Nasca board. The pacific sector and the NASC can be tension, derived from the eastern Pacific Hailing; and the Nasca Plate and the South American section of the South American sector are squeezed, derived the ditch belt of the Peru Chilean ditch, and Under the South America sector. It is the Atlantic Ocean with the east, and the north is the Caribbean. South America is part of the south of the American mainland. The west has a daytime, thousands of towering Andes Mountains, mainly plains, including Amazon Rivers and Amazon Tropical Rainforest.\n\nSouth America has an area of \u200b\u200b17.84 million square kilometers, accounting for 3.5% of the surface of the earth. Until 2011, the South American population has been 80 million, and the world ranks fifth. Among them, Brazil is the largest in South America, accounting for about half.\n\nSouth America has a diverse terrain, with long-towering reasons, ancient crystalline highlands, river allume plains and basins. The rehabilitation mountain range extends from the Mexican plateau to the Andes Mountains; the ancient crystalline rock formation is located in the Brazilian plateau, Guyana highlands, rich in metal minerals, and Copper ore in Chile is also in ancient geology. The plains of the rivers include an Olino Basin, Amazon Basin, Labrada Plain, Pengbara.\n\nThe Andes is 6,400 kilometers long. It is the longest mountain of the land, the highest mountain is Avoida Mountain, high 6,962 meter [2], Heng Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina. The southern part of the Andes Mountains have a number of row of Cidilera Mountains, with an average altitude of about 3,350 to 3,900 meters, which have an Atakama Plateau. Mid-Armed Andean Mountains is about 3,000 to 3,600 meters above sea level, divided into east, west, there are Bobith, Lake Michara. In Peru, it is also divided into many mountains, and there are many live volcanoes, including Qin Borato volcano (6,310 meters), Cota Park (5,896 meter). In Colombia, Colombia is divided into three Venezuela, which is finally turned to the northeast, forming the Merida Mountains.\n\nGuyana Highlands is a low-end land in the southeastern part of Venezuela, which extends to the southeast from the southeast to Gaia, and North of Brazil. There are many cliff waterfalls, the world's highest Angel waterfall is here.\n\nThe Amazon Basin has been accomplished by the Amazon River. It belongs to the tropical rainforest. It is not suitable for people. It is the world's largest tropical rainforest, the title of the earth's lungs, with an area of \u200b\u200babout 6.5 million square kilometers.\n\nFor an ancient crystalline rock formation, several minerals have several minerals, located in the eastern part of Brazil, and the main city of Brazil is in the eastern part of Brazil.\n\nIt has been extended from the Rarawa to extend from Argentina to Paraguay and Uruguay. West Nest Mountains, Northeast Picking the Brazilian Plateau.\n\nFor the southernmost mountain group in South America, it belongs to the highland climate. Its east is the origin of several rivers. The original covered large forest is now developed as a ranch.\n\nThere are several rivers in South America, more famous with Amazon Rivers, Olino, Labrador; Main lakes, there are other lakes and Malaku (lagoon).\n\nFor the world's traffic, the largest and second long river, the origin is 150 kilometers from the End of the Andes Mountains, and the river is bent, there are many branches, and finally gathered to Malau Island. The river has two algorithms, one is to count from Lake Lake Lake (the source of the Midira), about 6,280 kilometers long. The other is counted from the Lake Belavro, about 6,449 km.\n\nFor the world's highest air transport value, the sea level is 3,812 meters, with an area of \u200b\u200b8,290 square kilometers, about 177 kilometers long, about 56 kilometers wide, and 475 meters wide. It consists of Lake Chukuito and Virgina Maca. The south bank is the palace of the Empire.\n\nLocated in Venezuela, Tavrao Bay and Venezuela are approximately 210 kilometers, with an area 13,210 km.\n\nThe broadest area in South America is close to the equator, the temperate land area is small, with a small temperature band, and the tropical range is large. The Amazon Basin and the Eastern Tropical Rainforest of the Highland in Guyana. The Olino Basin, the western part of Guyana and the Brazilian plateau belong to a tropical grassland climate. The Andes Mountains are all highland climate. Peru, the northern part of the Northern Subtropical High Pressure, the East Southeastern Letter and Peruvian Cold Flow, forming a tropical desert climate. The middle of the Chile is a Mediterranean climate in the winter rain in summer. Strip Temperate Temperature Temperature Temperature Tape Chile. The eastern Labrador Plains is a humid climate in summer rain. Pengbara is a temperate steppe climate. The Patagonia plateau is a temperate desert climate.\n\nSouth America is mainly affected by three major disasters, which are earthquake, volcanic eruptions and El Ni\u00f1o phenomena, causing incidents such as human casualties, property damage, and impact on a country. In addition, in the northern Venezuela, Gaian and Surikan and other coastal areas will be invaded by the hurricane.\n\nThe mountainous movement of South America is squeezed by the South American sector and Nasca plate, forming the Andes Mountain, which is a new pleated mountain range, which is also distributed in many live volcanoes. In the past 150 years, 4 major earthquakes have occurred. The first time I have occurred in Ecuado and Colombia in 1868, the number of dead injuries is about 70,000; the second occurs in Qi Lian (Chile), the earthquake strength is the scale 7.8 30,000 deaths and injuries, occur in 1939; the third occasion occurs in Valparaiso (Chile), the earthquake strength is the size of the scale 9.5, which is the strongest earthquake since the record, 20,000 dead injuries, the fourth in 1960 At Qinbot (Peru), the earthquake strength is 7.7, 66,000 dead injuries, which occurred in 1970. February 27, 2010, 99 kilometers southwestern Talca, Chile Town, and 117 kilometers north of Concepcion, 3:34 in the early morning, occurrence 8.8 earthquake. The main volcano still has several seats.\n\nSouth America's highest Avoida Mountain, located in Argentina, 6,960 meters above sea, for the dead volcano. There is also an esure of Eusaya, located in Chile, Argentina border, with an altitude of 6,723 meters, for the dead volcano. Inaugasea, located at Chile, Argentina border, with an altitude of 6,709 measures. Qinbola\u00e7on, located in Ecuador, 6,310 meters above sea level, belongs to the volcanic.\n\nKotopa, is located in the harmonium, 5,896 meters above sea level, is a volcano; Ruis volcano, located in Colombia, 5,399 meters above sea level, is a live volcano; Sangko volcano, located in Ecuador, 5,230 meters above sea level, belong to the volcano; Tonggulava volcano, in the harmonious land, 5,016 meters above sea level, is a Hui Mountain; Piqin Chaoshan, in Ecuades, 4,794 meters above sea level, altitude.\n\nWhen the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, due to the weakening of the faith, and the strong wind squeezed the tropical warm stream to the South America, the water temperature rose, the spring flock in the West Bank of South America and even disappeared, and the squid was forared, and the fish is foraging in the fisheries. The seabirds decreased, and the bird fertilizer as an important raw material for phosphate is also reduced, and the local residents have caused economic losses. South America's West Bank has been drought to moist, Peru and Chile have thus rare floods, causing many casualties, and financial losses are difficult to estimate. After the environment is changed, many mosquitoes, mice, etc. have increased, disrupted infected diseases such as dengue fever, rat, malaria. [3]\n\nSouth America has a variety of environmental resources, but is affected by the colonial economic and land, and there is no economic take-off after independence, and is mostly developing countries. The main land is large due to the largest production scale, more income; small farmers with weak competitiveness live poverty. There is a gap between the rich and the poor.\n\nIn order to avoid the interest of the colonial mother country, South American industrial development is limited, only low-cost agricultural, animal husbandry, mine and other raw materials, and high-priced industrial products\nDue to the influence of colonial economic, South America is still based on export first-level products, and is unstable, and the South American economy is unstable, and it is more economical, and more economic crops are in response to international market demand. Many countries must import food, leading to imbalance in agricultural development.\n\nThe 12 countries in South America joined the South American National Union. The Alliance Headquarters will be located in the capital of Ecuado. The parliament is located in Bolivia, and South America will be located in Calakas, Venezuela, is scheduled to be available. The tariff of non-sensitive commodity and sensitive commodities will be canceled before 2019.\n\nSouth America's agriculture is a colonial agriculture, a single system, a large-scale planting, and its commodity prices are vulnerable to market fluctuations, causing foreign debts of South American countries to high. There are several crops in agriculture, with rubber [4], pepper, cotton, tobacco [5], cocoa [6], sugar cane [7], coffee [8], banana [9], soybeans, etc., food crops are rice , Wheat, corn, tomato, etc. Rubber production location is in the middle of the Amazon River. Pepper produces branches in the Amazon River. Coffee, Corn, Tobacco, Cascade [10]. Colombian coffee, bananas, cotton, sugar cane, corn, rice, soy, wheat [11]. Brazilian cotton, tobacco, cocoa, sugar cane, coffee, rice, bananas, wheat, soybeans [12]. Peruvian cotton, rice, sugar cane, potato [13]. Bolidian cane, rice, cotton, potato. Chile planting sugar cane, cotton, wheat, corn, and Mediterranean climate fruits and vegetables (grape, citrus, olives, figs) [14].\n\nThe land required for animal husbandry is large, only in Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia, has no obvious animal husbandry.\n\nThe Andes Mountains belong to the new pleat mountain, copper-copied, other blocks, there are more minerals, with a variety of more than ten kinds, of which Brazil is less developed. Brazilian iron, manganese, nickel, uranium, gold mine and gemstone and aluminum; Argentine coal, gold, silver, copper, iron,, tungsten, manganese, uranium, lime, mica mine and oil and natural gas; Peru Gold, silver, zinc, copper, lead, iron ore and oil; Chilean gold, silver, copper, iron, coal mine and nitrite; Venezuelant, copper, iron, nickel, manganese mine and aluminum and oil; Bolivian , Silver (now depleted), tin, tungsten, iron, lead ore and oil and natural gas; Colombian funds, silver, platinum (platinum), emerald, nickel, coal mines and oil and natural gas.\n\nNowadays, South America is slower due to early colonists, and there is no high-tech industry now. Brazil's main industrial steel manufacturing, chemical industry, petrochemical industry, machinery industry, textile industry, cement industry, automotive industry; Argentina main industry is the cement industry, fertilizer industry, steel industry, plastic industry, paper industry, textile industry, motorcycle Automotive industry; Main Indies of Peru is steel manufacturing, automotive manufacturing, tire industry, cement industry, wool texture industry; Chile main industry is steel manufacturing, paper industry, cellulose manufacturing; Venezuela main industry is a cement industry, steel manufacturing industry , Chemical industry, shipbuilding and product; Colombia main industries have textile industry, leather industry, chemical industry.\n\nSouth America's cultural is mainly based on Indians, and the European colonists introduce black slaves after a large number of deaths in Indians to supplement labor, so that they are complex in this area. Due to the long-term dominance of Latin Culture, Spain and Portugal, the South America is often known as Latin America, but Indian culture has not disappeared, and it is integrated into African black culture, and there is a conflict and integration between cultural and cultural, forming synthetic culture. The culture is more rich.\n\nDue to the long-term colonies, the official language of all countries is a language of colonial mother-of-colonial country, but a small number of Kuchusian, Guaran language still exists. The official languages \u200b\u200bof most countries in South America are Spanish, and other Brazil is Portuguese, Gaiaa is English, Surika is Dutch, and the French Guyana is French.\n\nSouth America has 12 countries and 4 yielding overseas territories. These overseas territories belong to the British (2), France (1) and Norway (1), which is affiliated with the British South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands and Bowe Island, which is affiliated to Norway.

This makes people have a few different \"Europe\" concepts.\n\nYou can click on the European map: show the boundary line formed with the historical cause of the Asian mainland. (See Asia and Europe's boundary line for more information).\n\nLegend: Blue = InterContinental Country; Green = Sometimes it is considered to be Europe, but outside the European border line.\n\n\n\n\nThe origin of the European name may be a woman from the Myth of Greece, she is attracted by Zeus that has become Bull. [3] A more academic statement is: this term may come from the flash to express \"the land of sunset\" [4].\n\nThe word \"in Chinese is the first to use in Kunyi Wan Guo, which is translated by Lima Siri, 16th Century. [5].\n\nThe terrain appearance of Europe is quite rich.\n\nEastern Europe is an inconsistency, the southeast world of Europe is a high Caucasus mountain range, and its main peak Elburus is 5642 meters above sea level, which is the highest peak in Europe. In addition to French, Netherlands, Belgium and other coastal areas, the remaining tops of mountain hills, plains and highlands, the Alpine Mountains, France, France and Spain, Andorra The mountains are bounded, the Nordic Polygonity terrain, there are many glacial cuts to dissolve into the fjords caused by the sea, and Iceland has a lot of volcanic terrain except for the Ice Terrain.\n\nThe European river flowing through several countries has the Rhine, Danube, Yibei River, Otte River, etc. In addition, the main rivers also have a Senna River, a Loire River, a Canal River, and the Russian Thames, the Bohe, the British Thames, the British Thames, and the British Thames, etc.\n\nIn addition to rivers, there are many lakes in Europe. Among them, the Ice Legal Lakes left to the country of Finland as the country of thousands of lakes.\n\nEuropean latitude is north of 35 degrees north latitude, most of which belong to temperate climate, extending north to the Arctic Circle, so the tapered climate in Northern Worth and southern parties. There is no hot summer temperature in Europe that has a hot summer temperature above 30 degrees Celsius, and there is no cool cold area with the most cold moon, and the disaster weather is also less than other continents.\n\nUnder the adjustment of Western Breeze, the climate in Western Europe and the western Europe and the Nordic waters is the greatest global deviation. Therefore, there is no cold flow in the coast of North Atlantic, so this winter is not cold, and the summer is not hot, it is pleasant, and it belongs to the temperate Marine climate.\n\nEastern Europe belongs to temperate continental wet climate, and the annual temperature is relatively large, but it is still smaller in East Asia in the same latitude. Southern is close to the Mediterranean, winter rain, because the summer side tropical high-pressure knock, winter western wind blows. And the Arctic Coastal area is a tundra climate.\n\nAccording to these two and three hundred years of archaeological discovement, it has confirmed that European (including UK, etc.) has some human activities in the old stone age.\n\nIn the first 4000 centuries of BC, the Celtics of Western Europe have a huge stone culture, and now there is a European boulder architecture. The Aegean Sea, the Eastern Mediterranean is considered to be the birthplace of European civilization.\n\nArrived 2000 BC, the ancient Greek ancestors settled in Crete in the Aegean Sea, which also became the birthplace of ancient Greek civilization, and gradually developed a city-state culture.\n\nAfter the 5th century BC, after the War of Bernardnese, the ancient Greek has gradually moved to decline, but its cultural influence continued to expand.\n\nIn the first 3rd century BC, the Greek border Ma Qi Wang State's Alexandrians conquered Egypt and Persia, establishing a big empire across Eurasia, spreading Greek culture into Asia and Africa, historically known as the Greece era, giving humanity to humanity cultural heritage .\n\nIn 27 BC, the ancient Rome raised, established a Roman Empire, became a big empire that ruled Europe, West Asia and North Africa, and the Mediterranean became its inner sea. The Yaping Ning Peninsula is the central region of European politics and economy.\n\nAfter 1 century AD, Christian gradually spread in Rome.\n\nIn 313, Christianity was set to Romanism and achieved the dominance in Europe.\nIn the late 3rd century, the Roman Empire gradually weak.\nIn 376, the Hungish defeated the kingdom of Donggodide, and the Gudder was repeated by the Danube into the West Roman Empire.\nIn 395, the split became the East, and the West empire.

The Empire of the empire has developed into a sacred Roman Empire. Many of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, etc. have been established during this period.\n\nThe Catholic Church has great power in Western Europe, and all knowledge inheritance is carried out in the monastery. The religious persecution and the Crusaders have brought great disasters to European people. During this period, the enlightenment era is called the dark age. During this time, Europe, especially Southern Europe and Eastern Europe have repeated invasion of Asian nomads, such as Arabs, Mazar, Avar, Mongolians and Turks.\n\nIn the 14th century, in some countries in Western Europe and South Europe, especially in the United Kingdom, France, Portugal, Spain, capitalism began to germination, through geographical discovery and overseas adventure, footprints all over Africa, America and Asia.\n\nIn the same period, a large amount of culturalities began happening, known as the revolution, which also triggered the religious revolution. Many countries were separated from the jurisdiction of the Catholic Church, and all countries in political and clicking were often triggered by the sects. There are many religious wars. On the occasion of the political and religious of Western Europe, Russia, the Eastern Trusted East, gradually becomes strong under the Great Emperor and the subsequent Tsar Leadership.\n\nIn the 16th century, the Khabsburg Dynasty, which was originally the will, Spain, Portugal and its colonies declined, and finally lost the status of European hegemon in the thirties war.\n\nFrom 1667 to 1763, it is an emerging British, France, the Netherlands, a total of six war: France and Spain - the Heritage War of the Netherlands (1667 ~ 1668), France and the Netherlands Laim (1672 New Year to 1678), the Datong War of French Alliance and France (1688 ~ 1697), the Wood of the Spanish Inheritance War (1700 ~ 1713), United Kingdom - Austria and France - Prussian Austria throne War ( 1740 to 1748) and the United Kingdom - Prussia and France - Austria - Seven-year war in Russia (1756 to 1763).\n\nThe final result of these wars: Britain defeated France and the Netherlands, capturing large overseas colonies, establishing \"Japanese Infair Empire\"; France's monarch authorization system collapsed, and finally broke out the world's French revolution.\n\nAt the end of the 17th century, the British politics had a glorious revolution. In the 18th century, the UK began the industrial revolution, and then the European continent has also promoted the rise of nation.\n\nIt has completed unity in the 19th century. With the advancement of technology, the continuous exploration of the outside world, the proposal of the evolution of the outside world, Europe became the cradle of imperialism, plundering resources in the world.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the extreme expansion of imperialism has finally leading to Europe to become a war policy source, and two world wars have caused great trauma and losing world hegemony. European countries have lost their colonial rule.\n\nDuring the First World War, there were the world's first socialist country - Soviet Union. After World War II, in the influence of the Soviet Union, a group of socialist countries occurred.\n\nIn the 1950s, two groups organized by the United States, the United States, the Northern Atlantic Convention Organization, and the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union.\n\nEurope is divided into two major political and economic camps: communism of Eastern Europe and capitalism of Western Europe.\n\nBy 1990, with the Soviet Union, the Cold War ended, the political pattern of Europe was significant. Socialist countries in Eastern Europe returns to capitalism.\n\nNow, the word \"Europe\" is more widely used as synonymous with the European Union. Now there are 29 Member States in the EU, and more membership negotiations are or will be done. All EU member states are Member States of the European Commission.\n\n(It must be noted that this partition method is not unique. According to geography, political, cultural, there may be different partition methods)\n\nFrance\nNetherlands\nBelgium\nLuxembourg\nSwitzerland\nLamnaden\nAustria\nMonaco\nGerman\n\nPoland\nHungary\nSlovakia\nCzech\nBulgaria\nRomania\nRussia\nUkraine\nBelarus\nMoldova\n\nRussia\n United Kingdom\nDenmark\nNorway\nIceland\nFinland\nSwedish\nLithuania\nLatvia\nEstonia\nIreland\n\nPortugal\nSpain\nGreece\nRighteousness\nVatican\nAndorra\nNorth Macedonia\nSan Marino\nMal him\nSlivinia\nCroatia\nBoss and Herzegovina\nMontenegro\nSerbia\nKosovo\nAlbania\nGibraltar\n\nEurope is the primary origin of modern Western political ideas. In terms of political systems, whether it is a democracy, agency, a constitutional constitution (cabinet system), double head system, etc. from Europe, and the world has affected.\n\nIn political color, European political thinking is from left to right, one is full, such as anarchist, Nazism, fascist, conservatism, monarchism, and socialism, communism, and in the history of European politics, this is more Other continents are unique to Europe. Now that some countries in Europe are turned to ruling with the right to right, forming a pendulum effect is also quite concerned.\n\nEuropean integration is increasingly becoming the trend of European development. The political parties of many countries in Europe, such as the European People's Party, European Green Party, European Freedom Democracy Reform Party, European Zuo Party, European Democratic Party, European Free Union, etc. In addition to the United States, Member States organized by the Northern Atlantic Convention is mainly composed of European countries. At present, Europe has 44 Member States in the United Nations, of which Britain, Law, and Russia are permanent members of the UN Security Council.\n\nThe current Europe is the most concerned strategic focus of the world. The EU's development strengthens European integration. At present, the EU is more super national organization, which is an important factor affecting the development of world economic political development. After the end of the Cold War, the US European struggle for European dominant struggles began to emerge.\n\nEuropean policies for gay people are also tolerant in the world. In countries around the world, there are sixteens in Europe, Europe, Belgium, Spain, Norway, Sweden, Portugal, Iceland, Denmark, France, Luxembourg, Ireland, Finland, British, Malta, Germany and Austria.

Most countries in Europe are developed countries, including the highest economic development level in north Europe, Western Europe and Central Europe.\n\nWith the development of the EU, the European economic integration is getting higher and higher. On March 13, 1979, the European monetary unit began to use European currency units as a currency unit for pricing settlement. Now the euro (\u20ac ISO 4217 EUR) is the current 18 countries in 28 Member States in the EU (there are countries other than this 18 countries, which are already the official currency of 31 countries and regions). The EU countries have their own interests in the euro zone, and more than half of the EU Member States still issued their own currency, and did not join the ranks of the Eurozone, such as pounds. The euro zone is one of the main major economies in the world. The euro zone economy has deeply influenced the world's boom.\n\nIn some traditional European traditional industries, agriculture has a high level of modernization. The total area of \u200b\u200bthe total cultivated land is about 290 million hectares, and the proportion of agricultural population is 15%. However, due to dense population, high consumption, most national food cannot be self-sufficient. European industrial output is the highest in all continents. The transportation industry is extremely developed. There are 350,000 meters of railways in the provinces; the total length of the road is 4.2 million; the total tonnage of the sea accounts for 45% of the world, which has a strong export economy. In addition, European aviation industry and tourism are also very developed.\n\nThe European population has about 728 million (2005 data), accounting for about 11% of the world's total population. The average population is the first in the continents. At present, European countries face more of fertility rates and problems of population aging, and implement various policies to make the population grow up normally.\n\nSource: UNPP\n\nEuropean people are mainly a nation (more than 90% of European residents), which is the most widely used in Baltic language, Roman language group, Germanian, Slavian, Celtic and Albanian, Greek, as well as the ethnic groups from the Oriental Language and the ancient Basque, in the European European part of Russia, there is still a part of the nationality of the Altai. Basically, people in nation have been divided into nation. Some people living in different countries have recognized that they belong to the same nation, but some are reluctant to admit that they only emphasize that they are the people in that country.\n\nEuropeans are divided into multiple different languages, including:\n\nSee the language of the European Union for the language of the European Union Member States.\n\nAll European countries have to accept compulsory education, or at least accept some kind of education training. European compulsory education is probably from 6 or 7 years old, lasting until 15, 16 years old. In most European countries, basic education time is probably only four to five years, but in a few countries, it takes seven or eight years. After the completion of basic education, the students who continue to receive education have a variety of types of schools, and there are some technical schools that continue to train talents in advances, and some technical schools. At the same time, there are many high-level colleges and comprehensive universities in many countries, and students who have completed junior high school education have been completed. Under the promotion of this education system, almost all illiteracy rates in European countries are very low.\n\nCarving art buildings, art, literature, and music are traditional things with a long history in Europe. Many cities, such as London, Paris, Vienna, Rome, Berlin and Moscow today, today is also considered to be the country's cultural center. In addition, there are many important theaters, museums, symphony or other important cultural facilities in many cities.\n\nEurope has a very deep cultural heritage. European prehistoric art reflects the achievements of architecture, engraving, paintings, and crafts of the European Times and Neolithic Age, where European Old Stone Age is the earliest art of human being known to date. In addition, European prehistoric appliance art has a strong performance, and learned is active.\n\nIn the 11th to 17th century, the rise of the Middle Century University in Europe laid the model of modern higher education.\n\nCooperation in European countries in science, culture is also very close.\n\nIn terms of culture, in 1950, the European Broadcasting Union mainly based on Western Europe and Mediterranean coastal national radio and television institutions. The European News Agency established on August 21, 1957 increases communication and cooperation among national news agencies.\n\nIn science and technology, European South Tianwen Taiwan, which is located in the Southern Halple, Britain, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland. In 1973, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory established by more than 30 countries promotes the rapid development of European countries in the field of molecular biology. On May 30, 1975, the European Space Branch consisting of several countries in Europe is very competitive in the space sector.\n\nAmong Europe, 72% are mainly believed in Christ, including Catholic, Christ and Orthodox Church.\n\n8% is Islam, most of them live in Russia (2,500 million), in addition to this, in Turkey (5.9 million), France (5.5 million), Germany (3.2 million), Bosnia and Herzegovina with Albania ( 140-2500 million) and other European regions such as Italy (11 million) have Muslim distribution, and Muslims in Western Europe are mainly immigrants.\n\nOnly less than 1% of European residents believe in Jewish (nearly 2 million people). Other religions (such as Hinduism, Buddhism, etc.) are only less than 1% of believers.\n\nIn Europe, the more developed areas, the higher the proportion of non-religious population; the more behind the backward areas, the higher the proportion of religious believers of God. According to the results of the survey released by the European Union, there is not believed that there is a population proportion of God, more than 60% of the United Kingdom, France, Netherlands, Sweden, etc., more than 50% have Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Norway and other countries, and low In 10%, there are countries such as Romania, Turkey, etc., with Portugal, Greece, Poland and other countries.\n\nEuropean countries have established vast colonies in Asia, such as the UK owns India, Singapore, Malaysia, Myanmar and Hong Kong; France has Indian branch, that is, the eastern part of the South Peninsula; Portugal, Guanzhi Macau, Goa and East Timor; Spain Zeng Tuition of the Philippines; the Netherlands has an east Indian islands, namely today's Indonesia. Therefore, the relationship between Southeast Asian countries and European countries is very deep. Due to this profound relationship, in today's international relations, Europe has a certain degree of influence on Southeast Asia; in Southeast Asia, the Philippines, the Catholic Church The bishop assignment of the assignment is also political and social influence. Japan in Northeast Asia has made a shaft country in Germany and Yuri in the Second World War. Now Japan, South Korea and European countries are mainly based on economic relations, and political alliance has gradually decreased.\n\nAlthough Europe and the United States have a strong historical origin and contact, it is roughly in the middle of the 20th century. After the Second World War, the United States and Europe have a close relationship. Prior to this, due to the Americas in the 17th century, it was places where European countries spread out of the people and prisoners. Therefore, in the early days of the United States, the United States, in the early days of Europe, especially the UK, which has been ruled by the United States. Relationship. Thereafter, due to the policy of implementing political mutual intervention in the United States and Europe, both of them have their own development in the 18th to the 19th century. The two world wars in the 20th century, making European vitality, but the US economy has highly increased, and Western Europe requires US economic assistance, nature is close to the United States. Plus Eastern European countries joined the socialist camp, and thus landed with the United States. During the Cold War, the threat of socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union strengthens intimacy of other European countries and the United States in Eastern Europe. However, after the end of the Cold War, the threat disappears, Europe (mainly EU member states) has changed in the relationship between the United States, and Europe needs to have their own voice, so some European countries are in the September 1 event, Iraq issue, Iraqi issue The aspects have different opinions from the United States, even with large differences, but its root deep allies will remain unchanged. Britain has more close closer of the United States in the above incidents, and the United States has become a very strong colonial relationship, but it has also been smiled in this US original colonist almost inverted into the US attache. Spain, Poland, etc., for the Second War of Meiyi's second war, making the United States praise these countries for new Europe, but with the horror of terrorists to attack Spain, Spain has exited her with the United States, from Iraq withdrawing the army .\n\nGeographically, Europe and the Middle East are neighbors. In history, the relationship between Europe and the Middle East has always been nervous, basically because the two are different from the religious concept: most of Europe is the main belief in Christianity, and the Middle East Arab countries Taking Islam as a state. Middle Eastern regions have become the colony of the United Kingdom and France after the First World War of the 20th century.\n\nThe relationship between Turkey in Turkey in Europe and Xiao Asia is very subtle, it is located at the junction of Asia, and it has been destroyed by the Undertang Empire. Now it is eager to join the EU.\n\nThe relationship between Europe and North Africa is similar to her relationship with the Middle East, because North Africa is in the Mediterranean Sea, and North Africa is also a harmonious country area. In history, only the medieval period, the Arab Empire has ruled the south of Spain, Portugal and France. Since European colonialism, Africa has become the colonies in Europe, France's colonial, West African colonies established in Central Africa, West Africa and North Africa, is the largest colonial in the African continent. The European colonialists compete for natural resources in Africa, and the situation in the 1950s began in the independent sports in African countries, many countries have independently, and they have improved. Europe and Africa have also developed in the direction of economic and trade.\n\nLike the United States, European developed Australia's initial role in exile of prisoners. However, because Europe and Australia are very far apart, there is a space that has developed, but in the link between economic, cultural and consecutive, Australia and Europe still have a very close relationship. The major immigrants in Australia and New Zealand come from Europe, develop Oceania with local indigenous peoples and other immigrants.\n\nAlthough many of the countries around the world (such as GDP, import and export, Olympic awards, etc.) have to treat the EU as a whole similar to sovereign state, the extent of European integration is indeed a global, but different European countries are There is still a significant difference in internal policies in some areas.\n\nEurope is a world with the highest level of secluded in East Asia. Most of the European countries have no national education, but Norway, Iceland, Finland's constitution still stipulates that Christian Road Dezong is a national education or only the religion of national subsidies, and the Greek Constitution still stipulates that the Orthodox Church is national education.\n\nEU member states such as Denmark, Sweden, Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Romania, Bulgaria have not joined the euro zone.\n\nMost of the countries in Europe do not have a death penalty but reserved for life imprisonment, Spain, Portugal, Serbia, Croatia does not have a life imprisonment, but criminals for crimes may be accumulated for hundreds of years or even thousands of years.\n\nOnly Belarus with the law of death penalty.\n\nThe Netherlands is the only European countries that clearly specify and sell cannabis legal. France, Greece, Sweden, Norway, Finland and other countries have severe control on marijuana, whether it is inhaling or buying and selling, and it is not allowed to use marijuana as a prescription drug. Most of other European countries prohibit private planting and sale of marijuana, but in the UK, Germany, Spain, Belgium and Czech Republic allow for use of certain ingredients from cannabis.\n\nRussia, Sweden, Norway, Iceland and Eastern European countries prohibit all forms of sexual transactions, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria, Hungary, Greece, Turkey allowed to open brothel prostitution, and the rest of European countries allow sexual transactions but prohibit organizational prostitution.\n\nMost of Western Europe allows countries such as sylining marriage registration, Switzerland, Czech Republic, etc., which allows the same-sex relationship, but does not provide syndrome marriage registration, Poland, Slovakia, Bulgaria and other Eastest European countries, clearly, marriage, can only be anisotropy The civil relationship between China.\n\n\n\n\nParis France\nLondon, England\nBerlin, Germany\nAmsterdam, The Netherlands\nBrussels, Belgium\nLuxembourg -

Length); about 10,000 years from the magnetic mountain culture from the Neolithic Age; about 68-100 million years in the period of the Beijing Sutra and Lantian in the old stone era. [2]\n\nChina's legend has Fuxi to make a gossip, the Yellow Emperor's era, the modern archeology, found 3,300 years ago (first 1300 years), 4,500 years ago Tao Wen, about 5,000 years ago, there is a turtle with text in the top 5,000 years ago Bone symbol.\n\nFrom political and social forms, China's history is distinguished. According to archaeological materials, it is gradually transitioned from maternal clan society from maternal classes in the early days of Li Gang culture or Yangshao Culture. At the same time, the primitive social equality is broken. According to the history of writing, Xia Dynasty has begun to attack the king of the king, and the establishment of a complete gift system in Zhou Dynasty, to the East Zhou graduate, the Qin Dynasty unified the political and many folk disagreements of the text and measurement system, and establish a centralized democratic monarchy rule. Since the Han Dynasty, the Dynasty is in the Qing Dynasty. Late Qing Dynasty, from the Western World East biography of scientificism, democracy, capitalism, communism, socialism, etc., various new trends, etc. At the beginning of the 20th century, the people's rise of the revolution in the past few thousand years of Chinese emperor and feudal society, and established the first Republican system in early 1912 - \"Republic of China\". On October 1, 1949, the Chinese Communist Party established the \"People's Republic of China\" in the mainland, and the Chinese Government of the People's Republic of China moved to the Golden Malaysia area due to the national civil warfare, and the two sides of the rules and war were maintained in 71 years. The Peaceful Pattern is now.\n\nFrom economic form, the ancient Chinese population is mainly composed of freelancers, private ownership, and commercial activities. When Zhou Dynasty, the business was mainly composed of official trade and \u6784. After Qin Han, the construction of central calls, scholars, agriculture, workers, orders, etc., of which were the main body of the agriculture, and the land-based bureaucratic is more freely commercial economy society, some Important industries such as oil and salt rice are monopolized by bureaucrats and businessmen. There is also a great development in addition to agriculture, handicrafts, and commercial trade. As early as the opening of the Han Dynasty Silk Road, when the land transport in East Asia and Central Asia, international trade had already started; the opening of the large canal in the Sui and Tang Dynasties promoted Nort-North Trade; the opening of the Tang Dynasty and diplomacy, the construction of transportation, Make all the cultures and materials in the Tang Dynasty, there is a flying money similar to exchange securities, and there is a banknote in the Song Dynasty; when the Yuan Dynasty, due to the comprehensive opening of the business brigade, it is very prosperous with Central Asian business exchange; Ming and Qing Dynasties It is affected by Western countries, and international trade in maritime Silk Road is rapid. In the early 20th century, the Republic of China implemented the \"People, Minzhi, People Enjoy\", and implemented free economic society; and at the beginning of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the first-grade economic society, which was first-owned, adjusted to reform and opening up, and gradually The transformation of the market economy and society, the form is called the socialist market economy under macro-control, and the industrialization and urbanization have developed rapidly, and hundreds of millions of people will transfer from farmers into urban industrial and commercial employment in just 20 years. [a]. At the beginning of the 21st century, China's economy became the second largest economy in the world.\n\nWith the accompanying person, it is possible to know the land that happen to the matter; with others, it is possible to know the home of the people [3]. History history, and must be geographical and nation; in Chinese history, the national relationship is simple, and the region's scope is very large, so the history of China, the geographical knowledge is more needed [3]. Cove with the past, there is a political system, social background, economic activity, academic faction, thought, religious beliefs, art creation, this is related to history, and it also accounts for an important position in history, and the nature is more special. More complex content [3].\n\nThe earliest higher primate, which has been found so far, lived in China's Jiangnan in 45 million years ago. Archaeological evidence showed 2240,000 years to 22,200,000 years ago, China has an upright person living. At present, the earlier primitive human traces of archaeological discovery have Wushan people, Yuanzi, Lantian, Nanjing Jutong, Beijing Elite people, etc.\n\nThe various cultures in the prehistoric era of China have passed the following stages: the old stone era mainly in the old stone (about 50 to more than 4 million years ago), then enter the old stone era, representing the mountains and the mountains, Today is about 20 to more than 20 million years ago.\n\nThe representative culture of the early Neolithic era is Li Gang culture. This period is a maternal community, and the society has no obvious layering. Then, in the middle of the Neolithic Culture represented by Yangshao culture, during this period, the social nature transitioned from the maternal clan society to the father's class, and the poor and poor division gradually deepened. At the same time, the productivity level has a significant improvement. In the late Times of the Neolithic Times represented by Longshan Culture (4,900 to 4,100 years ago, I have found in the Yangtze River, the Yellow River Basin, such as the Central Plains, Jianghan City Group, Haisheng City Group. This may be shown in the Longshan era, and the social organization has a large change.\n\nAccording to the current archaeological research, China's Neolithic Age presents a diverse constant: from the southern part of Henan Province, the southern part of Hebei Province, the southern part of Hebei Province, and the southern Shanxi Province has red pottery, Color Tao and the characteristics of edible coy and animal farststation. At the same time, there was still a cultural in Zhimudu culture in the east of Zhejiang Province, and the cultural cultization of Liangzhu culture in the north side of Zhejiang Province.\n\nThe Chinese civilization truly has the first year of the year of the year, the first year of the Western Zhou, the first year of the Western Zhou, the previous historical era, and therefore the earliest origin of Chinese civilization still has not been finalized. Although there are many records in the traditional literature, because of the late books, there has been no evidence that the recognized Xia Dynasty and its previous history have been discovered so far. Therefore, there have been people in the modern history of Xia Dynasty. Sex. In the western part of Henan Province, the Erlim site found in the southern Shanxi Province has the basic conditions of the ages and geographic conditions of summer culture, but since the absence of text records in the same time similar to the oracle residence in Yin Ruins, the existence of Xia Dynasty is always Unable to be confirmed. Many Sino-foreign historians believe that the full or first, second phase of the Silitan Site in Henan Province, may be the remains of Xia Chao Tudi, but it is still looking for a conclusive basis to clarify [Part 1].\n\nIn the myth of the phase, there is a statement of the ancient world and the female man. The legendary three emperors is the representative of the outstanding leaders of Xia Dynasty before, and there is a different statement. Three emperors generally refer to Xuanyuan Huangdi, Fuxi, Shennong and the three people in the blessings. The five emperors generally refers to Shao Wei, \u989b\u987c, emperor, \u5c27,. Taken from: (\"Shang Shu \u00b7 Preface\", \"Baihu Tong\"), from the three emperors to five emperors, there is no nuance, for a few thousand years. Written \"Hua, Rong\" in \"Wen Wen \u00b7 Text\". \"Zhou Shu, Wu Cheng\": \"Summer, Da. Therefore, the big country is in summer.\" Huaxia said China. \"The ancients believe that China is in the center of the world, so it is called\" China \"(Central Country).\n\nAccording to the legend of today, the leader of the Yellow Emperor Yan Emperor Triba, after powerful, beat Yan Emperor in the battle of Hanquan, becoming the leader of the new tribe, and then conflicts with the especially in the southeast, in the deer It is completely defeated the opponent and established its own dominance. The legendary guide car is invented by the Yellow Emperor: \"Datiff Guide, Huang Emperor and Yu Yu Wars in the wilderness of the deer. \u86a9 especially big fog, the soldiers are all fascinating, so they are guided the car, and they are \u86a9, ie Emperor. \", After this, the Chinese generation recorded the application of magnets. Later, the grandson of the Yellow Emperor and Xuan Sun Emperor continued to serve as the leader of the tribal alliance. The son of the emperor, the success, he is a Qijun, create a Zen, and the transmission is given. In the period, the flood is flooding, and the method of clogging is used. As a result, the flood is even more powerful, and he is executed. His son's use of the way, successfully governing the flood, therefore is initiated as the leader.\n\nThe son of \u542f \u542f \u7834 \u65b9\u5f0f \u65b9\u5f0f \u65b9\u5f0f \u65b9\u5f0f \u751f \u751f \u751f \u628a \u4f4d \u4f4d \u4f4d \u5230 \u4f4d \u5230 \u5230 \u5230 \u4f4d \u5230 \u4f4d \u5230 \u4f4d \u5230 \u5230 \u5230 \u5230 \u5230 \u5230 \u5230 \u5230 \u5230 \u5230 \u6ca1\u6709 \u5230 \u5230 \u6ca1\u6709 \u6ca1\u6709 \u6ca1\u6709 \u6ca1\u6709 \u6743 \u6ca1\u6709 \u6ca1\u6709 \u6b7b \u6b7b \u6743 \u6ca1\u6709After the benefit led the East Yi League. After a few years of struggle, he established his leader in the tribal alliance. In the suburbs of Qida, there is a glimpse of the troops, leading the tribal alliance to the Quandu, and the Enshi Truna in Gan.\n\nAfter killing, his child is too Kang inherits the back. Taikang ignores political affairs, during the period, the authority of Xia Jiao is weakened, and Dongyi Tani and Shaozhao Tribute. Dongyi family is a leader of good shot.\u7fbf\u7fbf \u7fbf \u519b \u5730 \u5730 \u5c5e \u5730 \u5730 \u5730 \u5730 \u5730 \u5730 \u5730 \u5730 \u5730 \u4eba \u4eba \u4eba \u4eba \u4eba \u4eba \u4eba \u4eba \u4eba \u4eba \u4eba \u4eba \u4eba \u4eba \u4eba \u4eba \u4eba \u4eba \u4eba \u4eba \u4eba \u4eba \u4eba \u4ebaHe won Xia Zheng under the support of Xiamen. It is too Kang to run the \u9129 \u9129. After winning the power, I didn't say king, but the king of Taikang's brother. But in fact, China is all coming to govern. This move causes dissatisfaction with many tribes. Among them, the peace of the heaven is open to the Heishi. I said that they were invisible when they were abolished, and they were brought to the fish and two, and the war swearing before the war, winning in the war.\n\nAfter the death of China, his subsequences. Then I went to the sip of the surname of Xia Tung, Ironed Two. Since then, it is unique to the throne.\u7fbf\u7fbf \u730e hunting, not good governance. He was abandoned with the loyal minister such as Bolo, Board, and Dragon, and reused the unfilient of the Birming's expense. When the winter is less than the rumor, it has been adopted by the Birming's monarch, and after being adopted by the poor, it becomes a member of the poor, it is reused. The coldness is increasingly powerful, and later, the opportunity to hunt hunting will kill the family, hegemony, to win his wife, gave birth to the two sons. The cold, gave his son, and put it over the other son of him. Putting the parent's life led the troops to remove the parents of the parents, and kill the phases of the somewhere. The wife of the phase had a son who had been in the same time, she escaped from the wall to her mother and she was still refuge, soon he will soon.\n\nAfter a long time, it is still still herd. After the casting, he sent people to chasing there was still still, and Shao Kang helplessly went to the \u6c0f (behind him), and later recovered Xiaokang after the summer. Then, then the less Kang was destroyed and sent his son to the Ge. At this point, the Dongyi family of the Central Plains has been in the past 100 years, and the \"Non-King\" period has been completed. Summer is the country, and later, \"Huang Kangzhong\". Through Taikang lost interest, this narrative, the history of the Summer, a fixed Central Plains tribe (especially Dongyi tribes). The child of Changkang is inherited. He learned that the dissatisfaction of Dongyi on the summer room, in order to consolidate the forces in the East, he moved the capital from the original east to the old Hill. He attaches importance to developing weapons and making troops. There is often a statement of \"\u677c \u677c\" and \"\u677c \u677c\" in the literature. He also sent people to the southeast coastal area (now southern Shandong, east of Anhui, and Jiangsu). The layout of Xia Dynasty expanded to the River of the East China Sea (now Huanghai).\u677c During the position, it was the most prosperous period in Xia Cha Da Chao. Summer people respect the \"Reporting\".\n\nWhen the child is in place, Dongyi and Xia have started peacefully. Among them, the nine tribes (i.e., Jiuyi), nine tribes (i.e., Jiuyi), nine tribes (i.e., Jiuyi), in the Huaihe River. After the disappearance, his slam is in succession. After the Mang, his sub-discharge occasion. The sons do not drop the rest. He has repeatedly led the soldiers to discuss the Western Jiuyuan. When you don't have a year, I'm in my brother. Distorting, his child is relaxed. After the junction, I will die soon, and the brothers don't fall. He changed the tradition of sacrificing the ancestors in Xiari, and he began to sacrifice Tian Di. Many Fanggang tribe began to dissatisfaction with summer, but the relationship between Xia Dynasty and Dongyi is still friendly.\n\nSummer, the bore has begun to decline. Confucius passed away, his sonus. Damn, his child is in place. During this period, the relationship between the country and the summer room was deteriorated, and the disputes inside the clan were also intensified. After the death, his submerged succeeds. During the period, the relationship between the summer room and the country tribe has been broken.\u6840 \u6840 \u4e50 \u4e0d \u6c11 \u6c11 \u6c11 \u6c11 \u6c11 \u6c11 \u6c11 \u6c11At the end of the 17th century, the leader of the business family was the first of the union, and the Union's tribe was crusade. Oblue the petrics, Gu, Gu, Kunwu, and \u6840. The soup is very powerful, and the resistance is not, and the battle is fled, and finally defeated the old site. Escaped to the sound strip, the soup chased, and launched a war. I was defeated again, and I was in the past 16th century in the first 16th century in the first 16th century.\n\nCentral Asian origin says that China's civilization and ancient Egyptian civilization are from the same source, but not think that Chinese civilization is a branch of ancient Egyptian civilization, but invested that Chinese civilization and ancient Egyptian civilization are also from a further ancient ancient times. Central Asian civilization, the civilization entered China 1600 BC, and Chinese historia's description of Xia Dynasty is the history of this more distant Central Asian civilization. This hypothesis also pointing out that Gujing Civilization is also originated from Central Asia, homology with Chinese civilization.\n\nIn 1921, Swedish archaeologists were found in Yangshao Cultural Site and discovered many color pottery locally. After comparing the local colorful pottery and the Terryo colors of Ukraine, Ukraine's Terryo Column Culture, as well as the color of Gansu, and Ant student proposed in the article \"Culture of China\". Since Central Asia, the finished product age is gradually approaching contemporary, indicating that China's pottery production technology is introduced from Central Asia, so Chinese culture may also be introduced from Central Asia. However, in 1931, Chinese scholar Liang Siyong discovered the three-stamping layer of Henan Anyang, proved that Yangshao culture, Longshan culture and cultural culture of Longshan, did not affected by the fundamental fundamental, and Antges also admitted this. In 1945, Xia Tan passed the archaeological discovery in Gansu, pointing that Antisson was incorrect with local cultural cultures. Qijia culture is actually not earlier than Yangshao culture, so Antisson's hypothesis lost empirical support. Since then, Ante students don't adhere to this hypothesis.\n\nAt the end of the Qing Dynasty, French scholar Lak Bury proposed China Civilization from Cubarbien, and he issued a papers \"Ancient Chinese Culture West\" in 1894. In the text, in the text, in the text, through the nearly 100 kinds of ancient Chinese civilization and Cuba Babien civilization, Rak Bien's civilization, proposed hypothesis, saying that the Yellow Emperor is about 2282 to lead the Ministry of the Bucks (ancient Schit Mi) One of the leaders, Babien, called it. With many ancient fossils Following China, it has become a favorable argument of Liu Yizheng, Liang Qichao and others refuting Lak Bury, and Fenglin clearly pointed out in accordance with the evidence of fossil in the \"Chinese National Western\". \"\" Someone in East Asia, \" \". Later, under the adoption of scholars, many cousiens were based on the classical codes as the post-class, Zhu Xian pointed out: \"The late arrival of the Han nationality, mostly evacted to the latitude myth of the Han Wei.\" (\" Words Learning Chinese People's Observation \") Finally, for the similarities between the two civilizations, Chen Jiazhi pointed out:\" There is a similar civilization from each other because the geographical climate is equal (\"Oriental Culture and the big letters\" ), It is impossible to infer Chinese culture. After the May Fourth Movement, the falsehood of Rockbury gradually lost support and was denied by the academic circle.\n\nIn Shang Dynasty, China began to have bronze civilization for the first time. About 1600 BC, the Shang Deco is destroyed by Xia Dynasty. According to the literature, the soup has three sons, Tid Ding, and Zeng, Zhong Yan. Tamding is a long son of the soup, and is standing as a prince, but Tid Ding is united. In the twenty-nine year of the soup, Tang Wang passed away. Thereafter, the eldest son Tamding was died early, the second of the son, the three sons were ignited, but the total time was only in just six years. Yi Yin Fuzu Taijia Regent, Tajia is the beginning, \"tyrannical, do not comply with the soup, chaos\", so Yin Anti is palace in Tong Palace in Tongfei. Taijia in Tong Pass, realized that his fault, Yi Yin saw this will meet Tai A, and also politically in Taijia. After the government, Yi Yin also made \"Tai A\" three education Taifes. \"Taijia compulsory, Yin Zenxing\", \"the princes to return ... The people are Ning\", created the first ZTE of the Shang Dynasty. Since then, the small armor, too pentarn, and the three sons are king, and there is a chaos of the brothers in the throne inheritance system.\n\nLittle A is the son of Tai Geng, and the first king. During the small age, the Shang dynasty fell for the first time. Large collaps in the seventeen years. According to the passing literature, the \u96cd \u7ee7 \u7ee7 \u738b. After the balance, Taisu has Middle Ding, and the three sons of the river are royal. Zhong Ding was objected by other rule forces inside the Dynasty. In the first year, the princes infringe in Gyeonggi, and Zhong Ding was forced to give up the capital of more than a hundred years, and the East moved to the class, thereby saved the throne. The blue-territor of the Eastern Earth is taking the opportunity to make a chaos. China Ding is in a nine or eleven years to collapse, and his own brother is in the end, and it is true. Its throne is a smooth inheritance or competing, because the lack of records is not clear, but the foreign year is in the first year, the people, the people rebellion, this may indicate that the throne is coming. The outside is in place for five years or ten years, and the river, the river is called the king, and moved to the phase. The defenders have led to the internal division of the regime of the merchants, the drama of the national strength, the vassal violation, the third decline of the Shang dynasty. He Han armor has been disconnected from the princes in the year. Zhu Yai, also the class party, the \u4f81 \u4f81 \u8054 \u73ed \u65b9, He Hanjia combined with Peng Bo, Weberk, fuel delivery, \u4f81 \u4f81 \u81e3. The river armor is the first king, collapsed in the nine years. Zhong Dingzhi, Zu Yi is in place. At the beginning of the place, it is in Xing, and his throne may come. Zu Yi as the grandchildren of Taisu, may be supported by the old aristocratic power of the dynasty, and the son of the son of the Qiqian is the phase, manage the political affairs. Such a regime is gradually stable and building a new capital. Life is high, consolidating the rule of the West Tower. The Commercial Dynasty quenched secondary revival. Zu Yi was in the face of the people's respect and soup. Zu Yi collapsed in the 19th year of the temple, \"Zhongzong\". Zu Zun Zu Xin is in place, the regime is smooth. Zu Xin collapsed in 14 or sixteen years or sixteen years. Warrides made \"Armor\" in Bu Zao, because his son Nan Geng continued to be the king, so the first is straight, but because Nanyang has become a king, the Huang Zums in the later period is sacrificed. . Warrides were in place for five years, their priests relaxed. Antine is the son of Zuchen, there is Yang A, Pan Geng, Xiaoxin, and the small Party B four sons will become a king. The four children of the four children have made the four spouses of the ancestrality into the weekly sacrificial spectrum, which is the leader in the first prince. In the nine years, the brother is in the end. Nanyang is the son of Wo A, that is, it moved in three years, it was in the south, so the king was named \"Nant Geng.\" Nan Geng was in place for only six years, and the son of the ancestrality is in place. Since this, \"Zu Xin - Zu Ding-Yang A\" has replaced \"Wo A-Nanying\" is straight, Nant Geng is in a short bit time, maybe it is located in Yang A, or Yangjia. The disputes in the inheritance of the throne have weakened the power of political governance, the national power is reduced, and the border princes have invaded. Brought the fourth big fading of the Shang Dynasty. Yang A for three years, Xizhan Danhan, Dan Mountain. Yang A collapses in the four years, and its bread is orthodox. Tageng Sanzi Xiaojia, Taisu, Yong Double Successful King, destroyed the long-term heritage system, then the disciples have been completed, compete for the throne, and they have moved the Duqi, so that the national strength is dead, the princes are invaded. It is \"more than nine disorder\" in the middle of the business.\n\nPan Geng made \"Phase Geng\" in the division. When the Shang Dynasty, he moved many times. When Shang Dynasty, he was built in Zheng Yu (the place is still controversial). When you go to Pan Geng, it is about 1300 yuan in Yin (now Henan Anyang), and fixed down Since then, the Commerce is also called Yin Dynasty. After Pan Geng moved, the Commercial Dynasty's social economy further developed. Until the martial arts, the business is crusade, conquering many small countries around, expanding the territory, and the business hall reaches the heyday. After Wu Ding, the Shang Dynasty gradually declined. The last life of the Shang Dynasty (Shangyi Wang) has great promotion of the development of economic and cultural exchanges in China, the Huaihe River Basin and the Yangtze River Basin; but due to the year launching war and large-scale construction QionGong Yao Tai, it is expensive Human and assessment, promote social contradictions, Zhou Wuwang Union, \u9af3, \u9af3 \u90e8 \u90e8, sharing, has been hitting the song (now Qi County, Hebi City, Henan Province). People are reluctant to sell their life for the ridiculous kings, and they have turned into the battle, and the kings are self-immolated, and the Shang Dynasty is destroyed. Zhou Dynasty was established.\n\nZhou Dynasty was the dynasty of China 's history, and the last hered Dynasty, which was the last feudal system, which can be divided into Western Zhou (about 1100 years - 771) and East Week (the first 770 - 256) two Period. Westerly from Zhou Wuwang Dai Yin Shang Jianguo, I didn't have to start from Beijing (Zong Zhou), and Zhou Gui Wang Dehi is one of the Chinese civilizations. The material civilization and spiritual civilization in this period have deeply influence the later generations [4]. Dong Zhou Datin City is Luo Yi (now Henan Luoyang), and its era can be divided into Spring and Autumn Period (the first 770 - 476) and the Warring States Period (the first 476 [5] - 121 years). In the first 256th, the king of Qin Zhaozhen was scrapped in Wang Zhao, and the East and the death was destroyed.\n\nAfter about 1046 BC, after Wu Wang destroyed, implement the feudal system, the big king family and the hero, such as the sea preaching, the public is in Yan, and the seal is affected by Xin Zhi Wu Geng's song (now Henan Qi County) ), Also sealing uncle (prison), uncle (Cai Hou), uncle (Huang) is \"three supervisors\" to monitor Wu Geng's actions, the first 1043, Zhou Wu Wang, \u5373, is For Zhou Chengwang, Zhou Gong Dynasty is auxiliary government, the first 1041. Three-year (Shudu, Uncle, Huo, Huo, Huo Shusai) I don't usually have a co-Dand DC government, and Uncle is more resentful, Zhou Xu Dynasty is more than her own years, but I am in charge of auxiliary power, so I combined with Wu Geng rebellion, history called \"three The chaos of the supervisory, Zhou Gong Dynasty is not good, spent three years of fixed chaos, Wu Geng and Puhuang were killed, Cai Shuxu was exiled, Huo Shu was scrapped as a people. Zhou Gong Dynasty hit these Shang Dynasty to build a residential building (now near Luoyang City, Henan Province). Ten 337, Dai Yu was completed. Zhou Cheng Wang Wei, Zi Zi is in place, is Zhou Kang, Zhou Kang Wang Wei. Between forty-six years, the world is peaceful, the penalty is more than 40 years, and the history is called \"Chengkang's treatment.\" Become a model of China's treatment in the future.\n\nAfter the death of Zhou Kang, the child's success is Zhou Zhawang. Zhou Zhawang is in the 16th year, Zhaowan pro-Qi Chu until Jianghan region. A total of 3 years ago, Zhou Zhao Wang also died in the Hanshui, and the whole army was covered. Its child is full, it is Zhou Mu Wang, the continuation of the fifty time. Mu Wang is very happy, still wants to develop in the Quartet. Also a good parade, to deepen the political affairs. The East Xu Guo's rate is nine. Mu Wangnan, Lian Chu is flat, winning. After the Zhaoyu era, the Zhou Dynasty began to reduce the strength. During this period, northwest Di Xingxing. Zhou Yuwang, Yu Di, violation of China. Zhou people are deeply bitter.\n\nDuring the period of the tribut, the people were in the past, the people were unheastered. At the same time, Li Wang takes Ronglong Gong Dynasty, monopolizing social wealth and resources. In order to suppress the dissatisfaction of the Chinese, Zhou Li Wang gave the witch to monitor, and the king of killing. As a result, everyone is self-dangerous, and finally produces a national riot. In the first 841, Li Wang was run to the \u5f58 (now Shanxi Huo County). The DPRK is called the Mu Huihu, Zhou Ding's two ministers, and the number of the Republic (one said by the princes and the best in the law). For 14 years (the first 828), Li Wang died in the martial arts, the prince is static, it is Zhou Xuanwang, forty-six years. Xuanwang Zengjing Zhizhi, political people, and princes come to Zeng Zhou. Xuan Wang, in his later years, Zhou Dynasty re-emerged. Xuanwang interfereled Lu Guojun in succession, with force to strengthen Lu Xiaolong, causing the princes. Thirty-six years, hindrance, Run, defeat. Thirty-nine years, with the west ginger, ginger, the battle in thousands of acres (now Shanxi Hounan), and then defeated. In the first 781, Zhou Qingwang continued, apprentice and political corruption, the national complaints, the national people complained; the King of the Three years (the first 779), the six-hearted fails; at the same time, the sky is still frequent, Zhou Dynasty rule . After the Wuwang was scrapped, Shen Hou's female and Yihi prince, changed the beauty of the beauty, and his son is a prince. Yipo fled to the state, Shenhou Joint National and Dogs attacked the king. The Queen and Board were killed by dogs (now in Shaanxi Linyi East). In the first 771, the West Week was desired, and the country was about 251 years.\n\nAfter the king of Zhou You was killed, Shen and other princes met the purpose, and at this time, Zheng, Wei, Jin and the princes led the Qin Wang's teacher has also arrived, so the Shenhou and Yan Hou and the outside of Zheng, Wei, Jin et al. The princes should be embarrassed, defeated the dog, and the dog is retired. Shen, \u7f2f, Wei, Jin, Zheng and other princes Li Zhou Wang prince Yiyi is king, is Zhou Pingwang. At the same time, the Dynasty, the Dynasty, the Dynasty, Li Ji Yu Ji was king, and the history called \"joined the king\", there was a situation in the two kings. However, most of the country in the country only admit Zhou Ping, not to recognize the king of our weeks. Zhou Ping Wang 21 years (750 BC), Jin Wen Hao kicked Zhou with the king, ending the situation of \"two kings.\"\n\nZhou Ping's first year (770 BC), due to the destruction of the war, although the dog is withdrawn, it is still nearby. So Zhou Ping Wang was in the escaper (Cheng Zhou) of Qin, Jin, Zheng and other princes. East Week started. Since the historia in the later generations often divide the East Zhou period into two periods of Spring and Autumn and Warring States, this period is also called the Spring and Autumn Warring States Period.\n\nBecause Zhou Wanghou gave up the Guanzhong area, the strength is not as good as before, it is not only unable to control the princes, but also rely on the supply of princes, mainly Zheng, Wei Guohe Jinguo, and the Warring States Period is Wei Guo and South Korea. The position of the week is thousands of foots, only the virtual name of \"the world's common\". During the Spring and Autumn Period, Zhou Wanghou also had a little call. During the Warring States Period, there was no appeal.\n\nThe interior of the week, and the criminals are occupied by the tribes such as dogs. When the King of Zhou Qings, Qin Yong was fighting from Qin, and he fought and retired dogs, but he did not rescue Zhou Qings. However, Qin Yong's heroic and loyalty got the affirmation of Zhou Ping Wang, so as a prize for the Qin people's work, Zhou Pingzhi gave the Qin Yong, and the vassal of Qin Zhou Wang Room was the prince, Qin official Be a vassal country. After Qin Yong, Qin Wen's father and son's team, basically, basically recovered. After the East Week, Zheng Guofang, Zheng Zhuang Gongzi took the Dynasty. They use the favorable conditions of the Dynasty Dynasty, often borrowed the king of life, so that Zheng Guo became a strong country in the early years of Spring and Autumn, known as Xiaoba. Because Zheng Zhuang Gonggong is too great, and often busy with his private matter in Zheng Guo, rarely enters the law, even if it is entered, it is only a mount, or does your own private life. This caused dissatisfaction with Zhou Pingwang. So Zhou Ping gradually tried to differentiate the power of Zheng Zhuanggong, which caused Zheng Zhuanggong's strong dissatisfaction. Zhou Ping Wang must rely on Zheng Zhuanggong in many things, so I have to explain to Zheng Zhuanggong, so I have happened to Zhou Zheng's incident. \"Zuo Zhuan\" has made strong criticisms in this incident, \"letter is not in the middle, the quality is not good.\" The \"unbelievable\" in the explanation; and believes that Zhou Wanghou and the princes are interchangeably, it is from itself. Explain the \"rude\" essence of communication. Therefore, this event is considered to be the epitome of \"league.\"\n\nIn the first 720, Zhou Ping Wang Wei, Zhou Dynasty preparations to the committee, replaced Zheng Zhuanggong. Zheng Guo has harvested Wheat and Cheng Zhou, and Zhou Zheng is further deteriorated. In the first 717, Zheng Zhuang was in the DPRK, Zhou Yang Wang took Wang Yan's wheat because Zheng Guo arbitrarily led the army, and he did not accept Zheng Zhuanggong. Zheng Zhuanggong is not full of Zhou Wang's practice. Two years later (the first 716) without taking the Times Wang and Luo Guo exchange territory (the agreement was implemented before the first 711), but in the same year, it was in the same year.\n\nIn the first 706th, Zhou Yang took back Zheng Zhuanggong's power in Zhou Dynasty, Zheng Zhuanggong did not see Zhou Yang, so Zhou Yang organized the coalition to attack Zheng Guo, but was defeated by Zheng Guo. It is for the battle of Zhao. Since then, Zheng Zhuang Gong and Zhou Wang have no longer have a large-scale contact.\n\nIn the first 770 years, due to the invasion of the northern nomadic tribe dog, Zhou Ping Wang Dong moved to the middle of the Yellow River (now Henan Luoyang), East Week began. Since then, the influence of Zhou Dynasty gradually weakened, replaced by a large and small and less than one hundred small countries (the vassal states and affiliated countries), and the history called spring and autumn. There are more than a dozen countries in the Spring and Autumn Period, including Jin, Qin, Zheng, Qi and Chu, etc. During this period, the war was constantly, there were five countries to dominate, chi, Song, Jin, Qin, Qin (another said it was Qi, Jin, Chu, Wu, Yue), and known as spring and autumn five.\n\nThe first dominating Gui Qi Qi's public use Quan Zhong, in China to implement reform, and make the class contradictions and fierce Qi Qi, and gradually be strong, many princes are in worship. Qi Guo led the nine allies to attack the Zhou Dynasty's Chu, Chu Chengwang was forced to be. After Qi Gong's father died, his five sons were fighting for national monarchs and lost their hegemony. Song Yugong once tried to dominate, and then defeated the Chu army.\n\nJin Guo son is on a chaos, and it is the Jin Wengong. Jin Wengong implemented reforms, so that the power of Jin State has developed to the Central Plains, producing friction with the Southern National Chu State. After the Chu Chu Guo, the soldiers were squatting, and Jin Weigong was divided into Qin, Qi and Song Sanyi, and became the Sino Planer. The Qin Qin Qin Mu Gong, who has been in Jin, who has gone ambition in Jin Wen, and has repeatedly waited in Jin Dynasty, and finally the victory of Jin Dynasty, so on the west, some of the west Extinguish, make Qin Mu Gong become the hegemon of Xiqi.\n\nAfter Chu Chengwang's Sun Zizhuang king, he once again competed with Jin Guo, Chu State siege to Song, Zheng, Jin State sent a few times to save, and defeated. Many Central Plains countries are powered to Chu Chu. Chuzhuang King became the Sinopeter of the Central Plains. After the death of Zhuang Wang, the king of Chu, the two generations of Pingwang were gradually weak. Wu Guofei in the southeasfang is very popular, and defeated the Chu army, captured Chu Guodu, Shouchun, and the king of the Lang Zhaowang League Qin Qi, Wu, Wu Bing withdrew from Chujing. Dingguo (now Zhejiang Shaoxing) crossed Wu Jun Yuanzheng, he attacked Wu Guo, defeated Wu Jun, Wu Wang Yan was shot, and the child of the post-hunting and the avengement, the victory, the winner, the prisoner of the prison. Wu Guo also sent troops to the country. Union with Lu Guo will defeat Qi Guo, but also attack the country, but In Huang Chi, the Jin army was defeated, and the Yue Wang got was hit by Wu Guo. After nine years, he gave himself to Wu Guo. Then, in the north, Qi Qi, Jin and other princes. After the death of the got, the Vietnamian weak, the Warring States is destroyed by Chu Wei.\n\nDuring the Spring and Autumn Period, the twenty-eighth cums were determined;\n\nThe people in the Spring and Autumn Period will create a well-fired chariot and cavalry equipment. At this time, China's metallurgical is also very developed. It can create a fine iron. There are various irrigation machinery in agriculture, which greatly improves production efficiency, thus lays the foundation for future population. . There is a history of Spring and Autumn (Zuo Chuan), Mandarin, and War and National Defense.\n\nThe academic thinking of the Spring and Autumn Warring States is relatively free, and the history is called a hundred family constant. There are many thinkers who have a far-reaching influence afterwards (including hundreds of people), such as Laozi, Confucius, Mozi, Zhuangzi, Mencius, Xunzi, Han Fei and others. There are many academic genres, more than ten people, namely, homes (nature), Confucian (ethics), yin and yang (star icon dreamer), Fajia (rule of law), famous (rhetoric debate), ink home (love non-attack), hunter (With the director of each family), farmhouse (Junmin Tonggong), the novelist (Taoist said), etc.\n\nIn the Spring and Autumn Period, the earliest poem episode (also known as \"poetry\" or \"three hundred\") in culture. The outstanding military fellows in the history of war have Sun Wu (with \"Sun Tzu\"), Sima Hao (with \"Sima Fa\"), Sun Hao (with \"Sun Wei Fan\"), Wu Qi (with \"Wu Ziying Law\") , ((With \"\u5b50\") and so on.\n\nAround the first 546 years, the battlefield of the Yellow River Basin is basically over, Jin, and Chu's two countries.\n\nIn the first 403, Jin State was divided by three door valve Juyi, became Han, Zhao, Wei Sanzhu, and Shi called \"three partial Science\". In addition, Qi Guo, who ginger, was replaced by Tianshi, and Yan Tian Qi.\n\nHan, Zhao, Wei, Qi, Qin, Chu and Yan, called the Warring States Qixiong, the Warring States Period officially begins. Most Marxist historians start the Warring States to feudal society, but most of the West and Taiwanese scholars will also have the collapse of feudal society, which is caused by different definitions.\n\nIn the early years of the Warring States, countries have begun to change the movement, among them, the Wei Guo, who is in Li Wei, first rise in Wei Wenhou, Northern Korea, Zhao, Zhongshan, Dongzhi, Song, Nanda Cota, Xiqiao, became a strong country. Qi Dang has risen in Qi Wei, two attacking Wei Guo wins, and long-term tenure. The Chu State of the south is strong after Wu Qi changed, destroyed Chen, Cai, Yue, and expand the territory. Zhao Guo passed the Zhao Wuling Wang to take a strong army, and Qin, Qi, and Chu. South Korea, Han Zhaohou, appreciates the Master of the Fas, and gradually emerged.\n\nIn the first 356, Qin Xiaogong, Qin Xiaogong, who used the Fa's business, and the Qin State power has greatly enhanced, so that other six countries fear, the famous Sushu Qin tour all over the six countries, convince the six countries and monarch jointly with Qin, Qin State but With Zhang Yi as the phase, the six countries succeed in Qin, destroyed. Song and Lu and other small countries were destroyed in the late Warring States. After the inquiry is destroyed, Qi State is the strongest country in Shandong Six countries. It has begun to be self-satisfied. It almost destroys Yan Guo, claiming to be the Emperor, and attracting the behavior of the Song Dynasty to make the princes, and under the leadership of Yan Guolong Leyi. , Yan, Han, Zhao, Wei, Qin five major army returned to Qi, the attack is the city Linyi, and after the country, I used the fire to drive away Yan Guo, and I was the country. Decline, Qin State basically forms an overwhelming advantage in Shandong Six countries.\n\nDuring the Qin Zhaoyu, Qin State began to launch a large-scale battle for the six countries, using Fan Yu's far-signed approach, appointed the generals to launch a battle, through the battle of Yizhen, the battle, Huayang Battle, Changping Four The big warfare sweeped Shandong six countries, laying the foundation of Qin Guo's unified world, Qin State finally under the rule of Qin Shihuang, in the first 221st, in the first two countries, completed the unified, China's history entered a new era.\n\nIn the history of science and technology, Mozi, there is Luban in the history of architecture, first inventive Wames, laying the basis of China Building Technology.\n\nThere is a poet who has appeared in the history of Chinese literature in the history of Chinese literature, and he has a literary work such as \"Chu\", \"Lai Sao\".\n\nThe Qin Dynasty was from the Qin State of the Zhou Dynasty. In the first 770 years, Qin Yong is active in the East Zhou Zhou Wangdong, which is blocked in the Guanzhong Plain and established Qin State. The Qin State gradually became stronger during the Warring States Period, and the Qin Wang Zheng was once again attacked six countries (the first 230 years to the first 221) and the world will establish the Qin Dynasty, end the Warring States Period, China has entered the unified era.\n\nQin Wang Zheng established the Qin Dynasty to claim \"the Emperor\" (ie Qin Shihuang), since then China has the title of the emperor, and launched a series of reforms to consolidate the empire. Then, Nanzheng Email, the Northern Expedition Hun. The territory is from the east of Liaodong, west to Linyi, North to the Great Wall, South Dagong County (north of Vietnam). Although Qin Dynasty's appearance is very strong, because Qin Shihuang is collecting power, excessive development, serious labor of the people, the rule of Qin Dynasty will not have a harsh, violent characteristics, so that the people will suffer from harsh bustics. The last thing I left in Qin Shihuang is an empire that has a foreign country. In order to consolidate the vastness but cultural empire, the Qin Dynasty, in terms of political, military, economy, transportation, all implement policies and reforms. The political system is the central centralization system based on the Emperor system, the three gumsteps and the county and county. The emperor of the monarch has the highest power, and the prime minister is just assistance, and the law basically continues the Qin State law. In order to reduce the differences in various regions, Qin Shihuang pursue the book in the same kind of book (in small as a text), the car is the same rail, the unified currency (Qin half) and the measurement. Military, building the Great Wall to consolidate the North, destroy the four-day Great Wall and Chengtun, etc., confiscate the world people weapons, cast into two golden people, and have five east pactions to strately in the region. In terms of transportation, construction of transportation facilities such as Chonda and Spirit can make the army to travel to all localities, and also have transportation materials in various regions. The Policy of the Economic Aspects, the Continuity of Commercial Changes. Improve heavy agricultural compressors, encourage farmers to increase food, and even have the opportunity to win. In terms of industry and commerce, salt iron monopoly is implemented, but it is not completely banned, and it is also encouraged businessmen who have worked as a widow of the Banda of Dan Sand in the operation of animal husbandry. Political ideology is based on the Magistra for the respect, implement the integration \"method, the operation, the law is fundamental, combined with fool as a means, the spectacular trend) three-in-one monarchic autocracy, and the five morality of the yin-yang family is always Say to the emperor of the emperor. Religion is the traditional worship of the ancestors, the sky, the gods, the gods, and the witchcraft, divination and horoscope, and the gods of the gods are superstitious by the Qin Shihuang. In order to clamp the people's thoughts to avoid rebellion, and retaliating the Qin Shihuang's squares, the Bench of the Emperor, this is a great hunger of the pre-Qin culture and the hundreds of people.\n\nAfter the death of Qin Shihuang, Zhao Gao, Zhao Gao and Li Schi did not fill, and took the power. Zhao Gao is the master of Hu Hai, and the brother of Qin Shihuang is not satisfied with the brother of the Mongolian, and Li Si is dissatisfied with the Montessor. They support Hu Hai for the prince, assume that the order is given to the Susu of the Jiuyuan Director, and the history is called the dunes. They waited until the East Tour army returned to Xianyang, Hu Hai was also in the emperor, that is, Qin I. Qin Erchart was placed by Zhao Gao, he gave a dead brother and killed hundreds of brothers and sisters. The Jiujun army of the Mengyi also took over the king. Qin II indulge in the sound dog horses, raising countless dog horses and animals; recruiting criminals and people, and continued to build Afang Palace and Qin Shihuang Mausoleum. The Qin Dynasty politically chaos, Zhao Gao took the court, blinded the emperor, control the monketeers, and said that the deer is horses. In the first 208, Li S was framed by Zhao Gao, in Xianyang waist, and the three tribes. In addition, the people had passed, and 300 times in the ancient times were in ancient times. The old six countries do not want to be strictly tormed and countless labor torture and countless labor in the same year. In the first 207th, Liu Bang and Zhang Liang will take the East of Luoyang and then won Nanyang, Dingwuguan, and enter the customs. At this time, Zhao Gao took the prime minister, because of fear Liu Bang, life and killing Qin II, changing the child for Qin Wang. At the same time, Liu Bangjun defeated Qin Jun in Lantian, and the army was hegemon. Qin Wangzi's baby killed Zhao Gao, and surrendered with Liu Bang in the sorrow, Qin Dynasty. After Liu Bang entered the main relationship, the abolition of the stringent Qin method, and the three chapters of the people's approximate law were heard from the Qin people. The first 206 to the first 202, Liu Bang and Xiang Yu broke out the war for the world, and the history called \"Chu and Han Zhan\", and finally Liu Bang wins.\n\nThe Han Dynasty was the first era of China's first in Wenzhi and the international reputation, and it was also the first dynasty of the Chinese history to go to the middle of the ancient times. It has an important key position and representation of the ensemble. Due to the short interrupt process of Wang Hao Temple, it is divided into Western Han (also known as the former \"and Eastern Han Dynasty (also known as Huan).\n\nIn the first 202, the Han Gaozu Liu Bang was officially called the emperor, and the country \"Han\", the Western Han Dynasty. After the Han Gaozu Liu Bangguan, the advice of Shu Sun Tong was adopted, restored the gift, and set up three gongs and Jiuqing. Appreciate Xiao He Zhen Xiang, take Huang Laozhi with the people, and encourages production and lightness. After the emperor, the except of the princes of the princes, so the Hanyi has been eloquent, and the death of the surnamed Wang has been removed. After Liu Bang and the hero, the white horse is also swept: \"Non-Liu's king, the world is hit\", the history is called \"Horse Oath\". The government officials in Han Early are basically served by the big ministers, thus forming the political landscape of Hanjie \"Boxing\". At this time, due to the moon for many years since the end of the Qin Dynasty, the national strength was weak, leading to the Han Gaozu Liu Bang when he recovered the river set area occupied by the Huns of Qin, and was homoked in Bai Dend, which was covered by Bai Deng, since then, Han Using and pro-policy. After Liu Bang and Liu Ying died, Lu was honored, Zhu Lu, and wanted to Wang Zhu Lu. With Chen Ping, Zhou Bi is also prepared, and is also united with Liu Royal. After the death of Lu, the hero and the royal family immediately sent a man, launching the coup, and heaving the grandmother of the Shandu Liu Hong, and the fourth child of the Han Gaozu Liu Bang Liu Heng is for Han Di.\n\nDuring the period of Han Wenmi and his son, he continued to take Huang Lao's means of impunity, pursue the policy of \"nothing\", and implemented light thin, and struggled and the people's rest policies, Enshi, to make up for the Dinner Civil Change of Qin The enormous damage caused by the many years of turmoil of the Chu and Han war, which has greatly reduced the people's burden. When Han Wenmi is in place, there are problems such as the princes of the princes of the princes and the invasion of the Huns. Han Wenmi takes these problems to take unusual and effective techniques. During the second year of Wen Dynasty (178) and twelve years (the first 168 years), the \"half of the rental tax\" is half-rented, that is, the lease rate is ultimately reduced to thirty tax. Wen Emperor is thirteen years, but also all-in-day rent. At the same time, it is not easy to send troops, peacekeeping to the surrounding hostilities, so as not to consume national forces. This is the policies of light and thin. Emperor's life is also very frugal, and the indoor car riding clothes did not add, and the clothes did not smear, and the accounts were not embroidered, and the county was banned from contributing the singularity. Therefore, the national expenditure is controlled, and the aristocratic bureaucrats don't dare to be extravagant, thus reducing the people's burden. This is the policy of recupping.\n\nShortly, the Si Di was so long, and he adopted a wrong suggestion, he cut the seal of Zhu Fusheng, triggered the concerns of all the countries, and burst the \"Seven Kingdoms of the 1944 BC\", Han Jing Emperor Kill it wrong, to send the purpose of saving the rebellion. However, the chaos of the seven countries did not ease, Jing Emperor appointed Zhou Virk to betray, and in March, the power of each vassal country was greatly weakened. After the chaos of the seven countries, Jing Emperor began to take care of the political affairs, and said that Jing Emperor is very simple and benevolent. In addition to the chaos of the seven countries, there has never been used in large-scale soldiers, and the War of the Huns has always been controlled within a certain scale, and it is still adopting the Huns and pro. While maintaining peace with the Huns and South China (South Guangdong), it is also actively prepared for the national strength, through the measures such as Ma Fu orders; this period is called \"the rule of a scene\", which is China has become a big Empire era, A period of praise by traditional historians.\n\nAfter the Jing Di drued to drive, his son Liu Che is like the Han Dynasty. During the position of Wu Emperor (in the first 141 years - 87 years), it takes a series of reform measures, and forces enterprising, making the Western Chinese politics, economy and military integration. In terms of politics, Emperor Wu has strengthened the emphasis on the Emperor of the Emperor, and the year \"Jianyuan\" was established in 140 years ago. The year is called \"Jianyuan First Year\", and opened China's annual number of years old, adopted the advice of the master. , Implement the force, weaken the power of the princes, since then, the power of the princes will no longer make a threat to the Central Chart; then, the golden color of the princes is not purely, and there will be more than 100 Jobs. \"That is,\" \u914e \u91d1 \u5931 \"in the history book. After this secondary event, the central focal power is greatly strengthened. Culture, before the abolition, \"Huang Laoxue said, nothing to rule\", and adopted Dong Zhongshu, \"Suscitation, Supreme Confucianism\", so that Confucian thinking has gradually become China's \"mainstream thinking\" in China . On the external relationship, actively deal with the largest kid of the Western Han Dynasty. During this time, there was an outstanding name of Weiqing and Huo to go to the disease. After decades of military, Zhao Emperor, Xuan Emperor three Dynasties, finally defeated the Hun of Hun, so that he \"indifferent no Wang Ting\"; also swallowed the South Vietnam, discussing North Korea, Make the Han Dynasty became the East Asian Overlord at the time. In the diplomacy, two factions of Zhang Wei made the western region, opened the Silk Road, and met with two princess Liu Qijun, Liu Xinxiang and the west of the western region, and then the purpose of the Western Region and the purpose of the Western Region. The Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty religious witchcraft in his later years, listening to Jiangfu words, leading to a famous \"scorpion of the witch\", and the prince Liu is forced to kill Jiang Chong, and the result is dead, the Queen's guard is therefore suicide. Afterwards, Wu Di also regretted, and built a look to mourn the Prince.\n\nAfter years of foreign war, Western Han Dynasty war, the accumulation of the treatment of Jingjing, the economy suffered huge impact, and the national strength also had a recession. To this end, after the disaster of the witch, Han Dynasty published a famous \"Wheel\" with the expeditionary army's loss, no longer pursued the policies of poor soldiers. In order to boost the economy, Wu Emperor will cast a coin, salt and iron, strengthen agricultural production, implement and discipline, cut white channels, and create allocated, horizontal policies, unparalleled sales, intervene, and strengthen the country in the economy The role, this series of policies makes the Han Dynasty to avoid entering the decline.\n\nAfter the death of the Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, the child of the hook, Liu Fusing, only eight-year-old Liu Fuling, is for Han Zha. At the beginning of Han Zhaodi, the three people were jointly academified by Shangguan, Jin Ji and Huo Guang. But in Yuan Fengyuan (the first 80 years), the fire is killed, and Shangguan is killed, Huo Guang has been exclusively. Huo Guang continues the policies of Wu Emperor in his later years, to rest in the inner, relax the salt iron monopoly system, and improve the status of Confucianism. After the death of Zhao Emperor, Wu Ji Sun Changyi Wang Liu Xi is in place. His behavior is indulgence, plotting to eliminate Huo Guang, but it is abolished by Huo Guang. After that, Huo Guangye has allocated Liu's disease, it is for Han Xuan. In the first year of this year (the first 73 years), Huo Guang also politiced to Xuan Emperor. Two years (first 68 years), Huo Guang died. Since then, Xuan Emperor will take the Hob Group. However, Xuan Emperor continued to pursue Huo Guang's governance route, vigorously rectify the rule of law, persuade the people, inhibition, and reduce the role of the country in the economy. During this period, the Han Dynasty was not only the internal affairs in the Ming Dynasty, but also for the Huns to continue to maintain strong, set up Western Regions in the two years (the first 60 years) to strengthen the contact and control of the regional area of \u200b\u200bthe Western Region. After the recuperation of Zha Xuan Emperor, the national economy was distinguished from the difficulties of recession in the mid-Division of Emperor, called \"Zhao Xuanzhong\".\n\nAfter the death of Han Xuan, the Han Yuan Emperor Liu Wei is in place, and the Western Han is beginning to fading. Yuan Emperor \"Jou Ren, Confucianism\", for social order Take a indulgent attitude, often ordered a big pardon, leading to the thief, the land is increasingly serious, but also causes the imperial power to rush to the mutual power. After he died, Han Cheng Di Liu Wei was in place, and he got a good woman. He won the love queen, and his sister (Zhao Feiyan, Zhao Heide). Zhao's sister could not give birth, and thus hated other people who can give birth to their children. The children of Cheng Emperor and other \u5ad4 \u5ad4 \u4e3a \u6b7b \u6b7b \u6b7b \u6b7b \u6b7b. \u6b7b \u6b7b. \u6b7b \u5bb3 \u5bb3.. \u6b7b....... Due to \"wine color invasion\", Yumi finally died in \"gentle\". Because of the rise of the Emperor Hui Zhengzheng, the rise of the exterior Wang's group, the family power of the Empress Dowager Wang Zhengjun expanded. After the death of the Emperor, Liu Xin, from the son of Ding Tao Wang, was \"broken emperor\", and the Dong Xian, who is a petition, and the power of the foreign king's power is once compressed. At this point, the country is already a final image, and the folks \"reappear\" statement. Yuanshou is two years (1 year) August, the emperor died. Taihuang Queen Wang Zhengjun sent Wang Hao to take Dong Xiancheng to become a big Sima, and greet Zhongshan Wang Liu Wei, which is the beginning of Han Ping, reformed the element. However, Liu Wei has become Wang Hao's embarrassment. Five years later, Wang Hao was only 14-year-old, and greeted the prince Liu Ying, \"\u5b7a\u5b50\", as \"fake emperor\", January 9, January, Wang Hao force forced the baby to retreat, tamper the end.\n\nAfter Wang Hao (foreign wealth), we announced a series of reforms and changed the country. However, these reforms are often unrealistic. In 23 years, the new dynasty was overthrown by Liu Xuan, Liu Xuan became more, but his incompetent corruption, plus the confusion of the green forest army and the Red Red Red Red army, so that the Han Dynasty Room Liu Xiu was taken. In 25 years, Liu Xiu Fu is Han Dynasty, Dingdu, a history called East Han, and he is called Hanguang Wudi.\n\nXinyu Tianfeng five years (17 years) green forest uprising broke out, 23 years, Wang Huan's political power has finally destroyed in red and green forest. In February of the same year, the Green forest army supported the Hanzong Room Liu Xuan as an emperor, restored the national number of Han, and the annual number is more. In the 25th year, the red dragonfly Liuhua was the emperor, and then defeated the Green Lin Army, and the Emperor Liu Xuan surrendered to the red army. Usually Liu Xuan is considered to be the last emperor in the Western Han Dynasty. In June for three years (25 years) June, Liu Xiu, who was originally observed, and the south of Ji County (now the southeast of Hebei Gaochun), is the Emperor of Guangwu, destroyed Liu San, still along the Han The national number, in this year, the first year of Jianwu, Ding Du Yanyang, Shi Yanyan. After that, after 37 years, it is finalized by the red eyebrows, \u9697 \u9697, \u516c\u5b59, and the whole country.\n\nHiguang Emperor Walescent Affairs, Jianwu for two years (26 years), Guangwu Di ordered the rectification of the rule, and set up six people in the country, further weakened the power of three male (Taiwanese, Siki, Sik) and strengthening the centralization; At the same time, the land, new tax system, revitalize agriculture, so that people's life is gradually stabilizing; in addition to Confucianism, establishing too learning, setup five-class doctors, is a commendation, so the scholars are fighting for the name of the name, For the beautiful political and religion, lay the foundation; the strategy of the defense of the Huns and other external forces, it is controversial to abandon the western region, and the foreign worry is restricted, and the history is called Guangwu ZTE. However, due to the sealing land, it also caused the land to be increasingly serious, and the local prosthesis is rising, and the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty buried hidden dangers.\n\nDuring the period, the Han Ming Emperor and Hanzhang were in the period, and the Eastern Han Dynasty entered the whole day, and the history called \"the rule of the chapter\". During the period, Dou Gu took the class to make the western region, the class super in the Western region, not only good at using the force to use the force to determine all countries, but also to use diplomatic means to contact the country. However, the Huns also launched similar actions to overthrow the political power of all countries, and alliance with new regimes. The two sides constantly repeatedly attacked and defensive, and after 20 years later, the class of class Chao was completely controlled the Western Region. Chapters and two years (88 years) October, the car ride Douxian leaders out of the army, broke the North Xiongnu, Deng Yan Ran, to let the class work together, history is called Yanyran. Two years later, Yongyuan three years (91 years) Dou Xian sent a soldier again, and five thousand miles to attack Jin Weishan, the big breaks the North Hung Shu, the next five thousand people, the prisoner is in the north, the emperor, The Northern Single was finally refused to end, and since then, he went to the threat of the Huns on the border of the Han Dynasty in hundreds of years, and the Han Dynasty was once again arrived at the Han Dynasty; Buddhism also passed into China at this time. However, in the late chapter, the foreign abroad is increasing, uncovering the sequence songs of the two majors of the Eastern Han Dynasties and the eunuchs, and the Eastern Han Dynasty will last more than 60 years.\n\nIn 88 years, only 31 years old Hanzhang suddenly drunk, when only ten-year-old Prince Liu Zha is, for the Han Han, he is in the beginning, and in fact, the political affairs is manipulated by Dou Que, and the national politic is increasingly corrupted. Dou 's \u6248 \u548c, shortly, only 14-year-old and emperor will capture the downside, the weaken of the weaken, and the Emperor's credit, from this Eastern Han's politicity is a battle for the two majors of the Eastern. However, the emperor is still very diligent in political incident, and it is not the master of implied. In the middle of the year of the Yuanxing, he was only a seven-year-old and emperor who had been seven years old. Little Mon Liu Long, who was born only 100 days, was for the emperor. The Emperor is only driving in 8 months. Insignate, it is the son of Qinghe Wang Liu Qing, An Emperor Liu Wei. He is the early Deng Yi, a charm. Dressed after Diligence and saving, appreciates Xianliang, and the power of his family is constrained, but it also condenses the \u5ba6 \u5ba6. In the first year of the Guangdong (121), Deng Jia was dying, An Emperor's pro-government, killing Deng's family. An Emperor relies on the strength of the eunuch and the \u960e \u5ba6. Listening to the traitor, there is no joy, and the political governance is stunned, the Eastern Han is fast to declap. In the past four years in March, Hanan Emperor died in Ye City in the South Tour. The foreign mini is not mourning, and the Han Zhang Emperor Sun Ji North Wang Liu Shouzi Liu Wei, Shi is called Han Yong Emperor, and it is sick in the position of only more than 200 days. After the young emperor died, the family was conspired to make a jade, and he was hit by the Chinese and sages, and the family was killed. Sun Chengye Ying Ji Yin Wang Liu Bao is for Hanshun Emperor. In the early days of the Emperor, the martial art power expansion, but triggered rebound from all walks of life. Yang Jia first year (132 years), the noble Liang Li was the queen, from now on the rise, Liang Wei's brothers Liang Si were appointed as the general army. Hanan Second Years (143) August, Shun Emperor Due to death, the Prince Liu Bing is in the emperor, it is only 2 years old, which is just 2 years old, and Liang Taishi is ruling. Yongjia's first year (145 years) June 6, Liu Bing took the year, only three years old. On the 5th of the first month, Liang Yu surrounded Liu Wei, it was the emperor. The Emperor is very intelligent, saying that Liang Si is \"\u6248 \u6248\", as a result, the emperor is killed by poisoning.\n\nOn the seventh day of the first year of the first year, the generals of the generals Liang Weizhi Lu Zhi, the chapter of the emperor, is for Han Di. The emperor is less, so it will continue to be governed by Liang Eastward. At the beginning of the Emperor, Liang Si's forces had a border, and he was dismantled, and it was full of private pins. The Emperor was also very dissatisfied with him, and Yan Di sent a soldier in the early August. The Shan Di soldiers surrounded by Liang Zhai, Liang Yi and his wife double suicide, Liang Shi's \u571f \u571f \u89e3. The Emperor became a new power center. Super, Xu Wei, Tong, Zuo, Zuo, Tang Heng five people were sealed as the county; single overspeaking 20,000 households, and then sealed as a car ride, thousands of other four thousand households, the world . Five-story greed, ending in the nine years (166), the first party. Yongkang's December 28th (168), Han Di drued to drive. The emperor did not leave the child, and Zeng Sun, who was opened by the river, was a place for Hindi. At the beginning of the Lingdi to the beginning, the extension of the Dou Too, Dou Wu is the fierce power of the martial arts that is headed by Cao Festival and Wang Hao. Yongkang's second year, the eunuch launched the coup, killing sinus martial arts, Dougai's loss was placed, and the external thoughts were weakened. The officials in the second year of Yongkang (164) were manufactured in the second party. And the Emperor I arrived, and I fill the fiscal public seller and polished.\n\nDecade of politics and the people's livelihood of the Han Dynasty, and finally burst into the chaos of the yellow towel, the Huang Towa army, which broke out by the Cape Taiping Road, \"Heaven, the Huang Tian; Heaven\" The call called 10,000 people participated, although the rebellion told that the Eastern Han Dynasty was strongly reduced. The key is that in order to betray and put military political power to the state animal husbandry in order to betray. All over the world have begun to slowly support the soldiers, and their original has been strong and economic strength, and eventually evolve into one party in the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty, and the top of the group. After the death of the Han Dynasty, the generals of the foreign nephew He Jin and the officials were ferrous and dead, and finally ended the argument. However, after Dong Zhuolia, the Wastey Emperor Liu defeated Hongnong Wang, re-entered the Chen Shu Wang Liu Xie, and burned Luoyang, Capital. After the death of Lu Bu, Dong Zhuo was killed, after a few years of war, there was a chairman of Cao Cao, Yuan Shao, located in Hebei, is located in Huainan, Yuan Shu, located in Jiangdong, is located in Jingzhou Liu Tang, located in Yizhou Liu Yan and other forces. Among them, Cao Cao's \"\u5929\u5b50\", overhead Han Room power, destroyed all roads, and destroy the main force of the most powerful enemy in the battle of Guandu, basically unified the northern China.\n\nHan Xi Emperor Jian'an thirteen years, the third government official, reset the prime minister, Cao Cao Xiang Xiang, monopolism. Cao Cao played in the south, but was defeated by Sun Quan, Liu Beijun army in the battle of Chibi, and Cao Cao returned to the north. Soon Liu Bei's fundamental, in Yugang, Cao Liu, three points, began to form. During this period, Han Di is just a embarrassment of emperor, the court is in the hands of Cao Cao. Cao Cao first was Jinzheng as Wei Gong, soon Jin Zhan Wei Wang, violation of Hao Gaozu's \"non-Liu Shi, king, and the world to hit the white horse\". Liu Bei also promoted the Hanzhong Wang and the Eastern Han Dynasty arrived in the name.\n\nJian'an 25 years (220 years), the spring is the month, Wei Wu Emperor Cao Cao died, and the world Cao Yu followed the Han Xiangxiang, attacked Wei Wang. In November of the same year, Cao Yuzhen, forced the Han Dynasty \"Zen to let\" the Emperor, the Eastern Han Dynasty, the Han Dynasty in more than four hundred years also officially ended, the three era officially began. After Wei Wenyi, Cao Yu, Han Zhaili, the Emperor Liu Bei, announced that inheriting the Han Dynasty, established a regime that used Han State number, and called Shuhan. Although Jiangdong Sun Quan is autonomous, it is independent, and after a few years, Wu Damei Sun Quan also called the emperor.\n\nIn 220, Cao Cao's illness, his son Cao Yu, forced Han Dynasty, Zen to let the emperor are emperor, Shi called Cao Wei (220 - 266), to this Eastern Han Die, China History officially entered the three countries. Liu Bei, who is the main year, is also known as the identity of the Han Room, and the country is renewed to the Han, and Shi is called Han (221 - 263). Liu Bei and Sun Quan have expanded forces after the war of Chibi. In order to have a dispute between the two sides of Jingzhou, the last Liu Bei failed in the 222nd Yiling battle, Sun Quan won the vast majority of Jingzhou. Liu Bei was sick in 223, and Zhuge Liang, who was supported by Liu Zen, recovered the alliance with Sun Quan in the same year. According to Yang Quan to 229 years in Yangzhou, Jingzhou and Jiaodang, called the emperor, National No. Wu (229 - 280 years), Shi called Sun Wu or East Wu. Since then, the situation in the Three Kingdoms is mainly against Cao Wei, and the territories of all countries have changed. Although Gongshu Yuan's Ownership (237 - 238), it is just a flower. Cao Wei Chao Tin was completely controlled by Sima's hand after Gaopingling incident. In 263, Sima Zhao was preparing for the military and play, and the Wei Yan was killed, and he died. In 265 years, Sima Zha is dead, his son Sima Yu is scrapped Wei Yuan Di Shui, the national number Jin, the history called West Jin, Cao Wei died. West Diluted in 280, I launched the battle of Wuzhi, destroying Sun Wu, unified China. At the end of the three countries, enter the Jin Dynasty.\n\nSimma's period of the Three Kingdoms was Cao Wei Shi, and the Siming Malaysia had mastered Wei Guo's regime. In 265, Sima Yan was forced to Wei Yuanmi, Cao Xi Zen, the country, Jin, Tu Di. In 280, the West Jin destroyed Sun Wu and united the world, but the peace and stability situation only maintained a short more than ten years. After the success of Jin Hui, the court has been chaoting, and the princes of the military are struggling, and the history is called the chaos of the eight kings. After the Gong Dynasty is a big injury, the people of the people will take the opportunity to raise the soldiers, causing the situation of the five hustle, and the people started from the World. In 316, the West Jin Diped, the north has entered the period of Wuhu Baiki.\n\nIn 317, the Mission of the Jin Dynasty, Sima Rui, said that the Emperor Eastern Jin, according to the territory of China. The Central Plains and civilians have been sank of south to form a situation in China's northern nationals and indigenous indigenous. At the beginning of the Eastern Jin Dynasty, Wang Gui and others took the town to static and stabilize the situation. The power of the imperial power, the great power of the court was mainly mastered by the world. Due to the internal light of the military, the court has weak control, and many people were in the heart, and there was a chaos of Wang Dynasty, Su Jun. Although some of the people's authorities have the heart of the restoration, they have launched a few times before and after, but the court worried that the wild heart took this to expand forces, most of the negative support. In 383, the former Qin was dispatched to the national division, intention of exploiting death. In the face of the disaster of the dead country, the Eastern Jin Junchen will launch a victory in the battle of the Water. Xie Xuan and other generals will win the chasing, successful recovering a large number of vestigers, causing the former Qin to disintegrate, and triggered the changes in the northern military and political patterns. However, the Eastern Jin Dynasty also took place to fight against friends and Xuan Xuan. The civilian burden is heavy, and Sun En, Lu Caica. The draft is also standing by it. Finally, Liu Yu is rising, stagnant, and with military power to win the emperor, enter the north and south dynasties.\n\nIn terms of economic, the proportion of Eastern Jin Manor is more than the West Jin. Due to the factors such as agricultural technology, under the intensive development of the Quan Quanyi Nationality and Wu surnamed, Jiangnan has been prosperous and prosperous, and China's economic center has gradually moved. Later, there is a large canal. In addition, there is also a great progress in handicrafts and business. Although Jin Dynasty has been in the end of Han Dynasty, there is a new development in philosophy, literature, art, history, technology and so on. Before the Han Dynasty, political sovereignty was completely in Huaxia, while other people were assimilated as a ruler; after the Han Dynasty, political sovereignty was not fully in Huaxia, and family or to conquer Huaxians, the grassland nomad brought by the frontier nation Culture is also integrated into Central Plains. At that time, the world was chaotic, and the East Hao's literati did not focus on morality, so that the Confucian declined. Some of the people who have witnessed that the digestion is not willing to open, and they will begin to make a lot of things, such as tutoring, and even gradually become a social atmosphere. At the same time, metaphysics began widely spread. Metaphysics and the Buddhist exchange of Buddhism in India have gradually been integrated into the Confucianism of Chinese culture.\n\n46 years later, the Eastern Han Dynasty often moved in the northern family of the frontiers in the way, and to monitor each group or increase the military source and labor. At the West Jin, the northern part of China, the eastern and western, especially in the state and the Guanzhong, a large number of Hu people and Han people. These Hu is gradually become a compilation of Han people, because they need to pay taxes, and when they are pressed against Hanguan or are discriminated against Han people, they have dissatisfied with the people. The outbreak of the Eight Kings, so that Jin Ting lost its influence in the place, Hu Tang was still rebellious. In 304, Li Ji Li Xiong was defeated by Luo Yishang and called Chengdu King, and also called the emperor in 306, \"Cheng\", 338, retrieving the country \"Han\", and the history is called Cheng Han. Liu Yuan, the Hun Yuan, who tried five Xiongnu, Wangshi Ma Ying, Chengdu. In 304, Sima Ying was sly sly singed, and Liu Yuan returned to the state. He took the opportunity to announce independence, called Hanwang, claiming to inherited the orthodox of Han Dynasty. In 308, Liu Yuan said that the emperor and moved to Pingyang, the national number \"Han\", said the former Zhao. In 304, it was established in Han and Han Dynasties to open the \"Five Hu Zhixiu period\". The range roughly covers North China, Land, Liaodong, the farthest can reach the North, Jianghuai and Western Regions. In the case of many nationalities in the home, many countries have been established in this range, and traditional historia believes that these foreign countries are mainly based on the Huns, Huabu, Xianbei, and \u6c10 \u6c10, collectively referred to as Wuhu, will refer to Huawei.\n\nAfter the Western Jin Dynasty, the war in North China is flying, plundering and massacre. In this period, including the southwest of Chenghan, successively established 16 countries, the history called the 16th National Countries. The northern economy is seriously destroyed, affecting the development of China's social, economic, ethnic, cultural, political, military, etc. In the 311, Yongjia is gifted to the people, making people escape to Liangzhou, Liaodong, and Jiangnan, so that the economic culture in these areas is gradually prosperous, and the economic center begins to move. During the period of the crosses, the Queen of Qinchen was unified in North China, but in Nanzheng Dongchun, the battle of the water was defeated. After that, the various families in the Guanandong and the voids, plus the Eastern Jinbei Exotic, Qi Qin's comprehensive collapse, the north is again confusing. After the Northern Wei Dynasty, after the operation of Tuo Gui, Tuo Tuo and Tuoba, in the final 439, I entered the Northern and South Dynasties.\n\nFrom 420 Liu Yu Dongjin, Liu Song began, until the 589th, the Nanyan Chen, listed in Dongjin, Wuhu 16, under the Sui Dynasty. Because the north and south two trend have been opposed, it is called the north and south director. Nan Dynasty (420-1589) included Song, Qi, Liang, Chen and other four Dynasties; North Dynasty (439 - 589) included the North Wei, East Wei, Western Wei, North Qi and North Zhou and other five Dynasties.\n\nThe Southern Dynasty royal is mainly a cold door or a mission, because the military power is gradually mastered by the cold door or the mission, so it can make the throne. The initial economy gradually recovered, and the military power was strong. Due to the strategic error and the North Dynasty military power, the border is successively moved. The emperor and the room were often bloody for the throne. The Nanliang is improved by Liang Wu Emperor, so that the national strength is strong. In the old age, the country is unusually reduced by the Southern Dynasties, and the four-fold five cracked, the Oversteen of the Sudden Bund is completely collapsed. Although Nan Chen's Chen Wenmi is unified, the national strength has declined, and it can only be resistant to the North Dynasty. The Northern Dynasty was invested in the Wuhu Baiki and the emerging dynasty. The Northern Wei Royal Hue is the Xianbei, the Han officials are affected by the five Hu culture, and they are more married with the Men, and the Xianzhuang Royal Royal Royal Royal Royal Han has also been carried out by Chinese culture. The Northern Wei was taurse by the north, until the friendly Turkicon and then accepted the South Dynasty. In the late stage, the strength is caused after the chaos and farmers' riots. The Northern Wei Split is the Western Wei, the Western Wei, the Wen Wei, the Wen Wei, the West Wei, which is also replaced by Gaoshi North Qi and Yu Wenquan. North Qi is mainly composed of Liuzhen Group, and the early military power is strong. North Zhou Xiang Shuangjun is less than that, the political status is not as good as Chen Chen. Finally, the Guanyan Group pioneered by Yu Wentai, annexing the political increasing northern Qi. After the death of the Emperor North Zhou, Han people Yang Jian grasped the court. After the establishment of the Sui Dynasty, he was established for eight years later, he sold troops to China.\n\nCompared to the situation of the North Dynasty, the situation of all class opposes, the south chair of the economy continues to grow is relatively stable, and Yuan Jiazhi's treatment and the treatment of Yongming. The Central Plains population has continued to south from the chaos of the yellow towel and Yongjia's chaos, bringing labor and production technology. The prosperity of Jiangnan made China's economic and South to establish the Sui Tang Dynasty during the emperor. In terms of culture, the chaos of the world provides the freedom of thought to provide fertilizers, and puts forward pragmatic joining and no instructions. Create a unique opinion and theory of literature, art, and technology. Metaphysics, Buddhism and Taoism are very prosperous. Among them, Buddhism has driven the development of the grottoes, Dunhuang Mogao Grottoes, Maiji Mountain Grottoes, and Yungang Grottoes and Longmen Grottoes in Later. The foreign exchange is also very prosperous, east to Japan and North Korea Peninsula, west to Western Regions, Central Asia, Western Asia (Eran Hull), South to Southeast Asia and India.\n\nIn the early days of the North and South Dynasties are still the political situation of the world, and the social class is divided into the World, Qi people compiled households, indiscriminate people and slaves. The World has a large number of indiscriminate people who do not need to pay taxes to produce and combat, affecting the taxation of the court. Although the Emperor of the South Dynasties still needs the support of the mainstream, but also supports the Hanmen to balance the political force, and shoot in the imperial examination system in the south. The South Dynasty is gradually recession because of long-term comfort, and it completely collapsed after Hou Jing. The North Dynasty Hu is lacks political experience, so reusing the Han people, causing the cultural seeds of the two sides, and has formed a cultural mix, and the Hanhua Movement of Wei Xiaowen is the most in the might of the north of Wei Xiaowen. The mixed process produces a fierce ideological conflict, political struggle or racial conflict, such as six towns and civil changes, north Qi's haunt sports. The North Zhou established the policy of China, the integration of Xianbei and Chinese culture to eliminate Hu Han. After the unified day of the Sui Dynasty, he combined with the southern part of the Jiangnan and formed a new Han nationality, creating an open and inclusive Sui and Tang Dynasties.\n\nIn 581, Yang Jian rejected Beizhou established Sui Dynasty and Dingdu Chang'an (now near Xi'an, Shaanxi Province), Yang Jian became the Emperor Wen. In the 589th, the south chapter is united, and the world is unified. The Sui Dynasty was a five-haired Han nationality to re-establish the Dynasty Dynasty in the north, ending from the split situation of nearly three hundred years since Jin Yongjia. The Sui Dynasty is one of the greatest elements in history. The Sui Dynasty established an important system in politics - three provinces, creating far-reaching imperial examination systems, reforming the law; continued to implement and reform the preparation and reform of the government; In the economy, on the one hand, the security system and the rental modulation are implemented. On the other hand, it takes \"big rope appearance\" and \"ignitation samples\" and other measures to increase government revenue, plus the thrift of Sui Wen, which makes the national festival . Saving a lot of food in food, is the richest, national number, number of mouths and cultivated land in China, and has reached the level of the Tang Dynasty, and is statistically available. Five or sixty years. The Emperor Wen Dynasty was an emperor, and the history of this period called \"the rule of the emperor\". In the 610nd Daily Canal system, the Sui Dynasty was completed, consolidating the central government, strengthening the links between the north and south economies, culture, and the economic and political big one Dynasty dynasty. However, the Emperor Emperor has just been used in his later years, aggravating the penalty, laying the foundation for the destruction of the Sui Dynasty. After the death of the Emperor, his son of the Emperor mobilized a large amount of labor forces, on the one hand, there was a lot of work, on the one hand, and the poor and luxurious, in the year, the peasants were overwhelmed, which caused the Sui and Dynasties to demise. There were only 38 years in the Sui Dynasty, and it was another powerful and short-lived dynasty dynasty.\n\nThe Sui Dynasty was in the large year, so that the people of all parts of the country changed. Li Yuan saw chaos in the world, and the Taiyuan was tired in 617. Soon, I occupied the Daxing City. Li Yuan has an emperor for the emperor. In May, I forced Tang Dynasty in the same year, Jiang Dynasty, Tang Dynasty, Tang Gaozu. Dusheng Daxing was renamed for Changan. Li Yuan established the Tang Dynasty, the Tang Dynasty, the Tang Ganjun Li Mi, the Xue Yu, Xue Ren, Wuwei, Li Rail, Xue Renxi, Wuwei, and Luoyang Wang Shiqi, and Hebei Xia Duan Jiande. In the 623th, the Secretary of the Secret of Duaven, Duaven, Danyang, Tang Dynasty, was captured by Tang Jun, and the Jiangnan is flat. In the 624th, the Tang Dynasty was basically unified. In 628, Chai Shao led the army to eliminate the Turki, and the Tang Dynasty unified war ended.\n\nIn 626, Li Shimin launched the change of Xuanwumen. Li Yuanzen made the emperor and became the Emperor. Li Shimin has relaxed, that is, Tang Taizong. Tang Taizong Zhiji Zhi, Nash, gradually recovering the national strength of the Tang Dynasty. In the interior, Tang Taizong promoted the formation of all-in-law and rental and enhancing agriculture. In the system system, the system of retrofitting the Sui Dynasty has formed three provinces and the imperialism, restricting the development of the imperial power and the aristocratic attack. In addition, Tang Taizong adopted a positive defense, strategic with war war, and appealing the quartet. In the 627th, the Eastern Eastern Tongyu is Xue Yantuo, returning to the ancient, with the contrast part because of the decree and reform of the Khan Khan, have been separated, and the Xue Yantuo is sweaty, and the troops are also returned to Tang. towards. According to Liang Luoiren, Liang Luore, 628, was returned to Tang Dynasty. In 629, Li Jing rate the cavalry surprise attacked the East Turk, and the northern people in the northern part of the northern tribute, Zhimin people respect Tang Taizong as Tiankan. In the 635th, Li Jing took Zhujing Valley. In the 637th, the Southern Sudang West is captured under the west, 641 Wencheng Princess and Tuboz Puson praised the wedding wedding. These all stabilize the relationship between the Tang Dynasty and the Quartet. The national stability during the chaout period, the economy is restored and developed, and the history is called \"the treatment of chaise\".\n\nIn the case of Xi Xi Ziyu, the West Expansion of Xihai and the Aumi River is destroyed in 659, and the Ashu Guardu is set up in the huge guscal city (now Kyrgystoke Mark). And on the Western Sishling west, let the vomiting rolls, the kings of the Navaro, etc. Central Asian monarch and serve. In the East, with Xinluo, we will destroy the Northeast Strong National Gogi and Baekje, and defeated Japanese assistants. In the Korean Peninsula, the Tang Dynasty established Antong Guardu Guardian, and also indirectly promoted the New Year of the North Korean Peninsula. North Korea became the most important country in China after 1,300 years.\n\nSince 660, Gao Zong is due to health reasons, many political affairs have gradually handed over to Wu Zetian, and Wu Zetian has become one of the highest rulers, with Gao Zong and called \"two holy\". After the death of Gao Zong, the Prince Li Xian is in Tang Zhongzong. Wu Zetian soon will be the Chinese waste into the king, and the four sons Li Dan is the emperor, which is Tang Ruizong. Wu Zetian in 690 waste, that is, the emperor, changing the country, is Zhou, ie Wu Zhou, Duodu Ronang, and re-emperor. Wu Zetian became the only female emperor in Chinese history. During the power of Wu Zetian, the country has a greater development during the chance. Wu Zetin's later years, with an abstament of 705, the history called Shenlong Revolution.\n\n712 Li Longji is in place, that is, Tang Xuanzong. Tang Xuanzong period can be divided into two parts: Kaiyuan and Tianbao, which is clear about the political relatively clear period in the first thirty years. Tang Xuanzong put forward the military, Wei as a quite, and as a role model, as a role of ruling. He once again approve Yao Chong, Song Wei, Lu Huai Shen, Zhang Jiu Ling and Han Hu, and Guangyan said. For example, the advice of Zhang Jiubi is adopted, and the guidelines in the Beijing officials have been admitted to all supervisions and training administrative capabilities, and there will be a criticism of the capital.

In addition, improve the relationship between Tubo, East Turki, Qi Dan and \u595a, implement and pro-policy. Listening to Yao Chong and Song Yu's suggestion, enrich the border defense military affairs, and avoid war with foreign countries. These measures of Tang Xuanzong have enabled Tang Dynasty to enter the whole day, and the population has grown a lot, the property is abundant, and the history is called Kaiyuan.\n\nTang Xuanzong changed to Yuanbao in 742. Tang Xuanzong is full of old age, indulge in enjoyment, handing the political affairs to Li Linyi, Yang Guozhong handled, and fosted Yang Guifei. In November 755, An Lushan was in the launch of Yang Guozhong, and his historical is called the chaos of the Sistance.

He used Yang Yan to promote the two tax laws, with Liu Wei's reform, and modify salt law, and normalize the fiscal. But he is just a man, no one is clear. Tang Dezong once appointed the stunning, and the relatives of the official, the government day decline. In 805, Downten died, Prince Li Yu Ji, that is, Tang Shuzong. The problems left by the Tang Dynasty were getting more serious, and Tang Shuzong and Tang Xianzong did an attempt to solve it, including Tang Xianzhong's success, realizing Yuanhe ZTE. Most of the political power of the Tang Dynasty, most of the political power was controlled by the emperor and the prime minister, but after Tianbao, it turned into the union of the emperor and the inner court, and the exterior prime minister became political second-stream role.

At that time, Mongolia's primary country was Jin Dynasty. Because Jin Dynasty and its allied in Western Summer went to decline, Mongolia attacked Xixia and Jinchao, and attacked the West Summer in August 1227. March 1234 attacked Jin Dynasty, completely collected North China. In the West, Mongolia launched three times, making the Mongolian empire dominated the European continent.\n\nAfter the death of the Constitution of the Song Dynasty, the Constitution of the Song Dynasty was died in the death of the Song Dynasty. On May 5th, 1260, Dubei was in the establishment of some of the Zongwang and the Montan Han Dynasty. He was self-found for the emperor of Mongolia, . Shortly after Kublai Lie, Ali did not honor the Sakura Congress in Hara and Lin, the Mongolian Empire Capital, and was selected by Zongwang and Minister of Akai and the Minister. Support for Broad Katdom.\n\nSully Sweating In order to become Chinese emperor, the main content has a reflection number. In 1267, he will be willing to sweat in Yanjing (now Beijing), and Liu Bingzhong is built in Damu. In 1272, it was changed to most (Turkic-looking Khanli, the meaning of the Emperor), will be accompanying each other. On December 18, 1271, Kublai Slim announced the \"Building Guo Yu\", take the \"Easy Classic\" meaning, change the national number from the big Mongolian country to the big yuan, Jianguan Yuan Dynasty, Dubei That is, in 1260, the establishment of the province, setting up a pivot court in 1263, establishing a national institution in Royal Shitai in 1268; setting up a large agriculture and promoting agriculture; Zun Kong Chongru and vigorously developing the policy of promoting Confucianism. However, in order to retain the original Mongolian system, it finally formed Montan two yuan politics. Although Yuan Shizu won the sweat of Mongolian sweat, finally became an emperor, but because the sweat was not legal and advocated, the Mongolian room did not recognize the Kimgun's sweat, four sweat people have three countries Do not deliberately, the Mongolian empire completely disintegrates. In the end, the sea from the Taiwan Taiwan is from the troops to compete for the sweat, causing turmoil in the north, and the history called the sea.\n\nIn March 1279, Zhang Hongfan attacked the South Song and the Emperor Song, who took the 8-year-old small emperor Song and Yan Zhao Zhao Shi, and the south of the Song Dynasty. The Yuan Dynasty unified China and ended more than 300 years of splitting in the splitting of Yan Yun's 16th state. The Yuan Dynasty is surrounded by some countries or regions (including Gaoli, Annan, Zhancheng, Myanmar), joining the tribute relationship between the Yuan Dynasty.\n\nIn 1294, Yuan Zu was driving, Yuan Chengchong succession. Yuan Chengchong mainly abides by the constitutional constitutional period in the Yuanbu, appoints his niece (the child of Ma Ba, the son of the Aquarium), and the forests in the parity of the Northwest China, and the order will stop discussing Japanese and Annan. In the interior of rectifying domestic politics and reducing the tax of Jiangnan. However, due to the excessive reward of Yuan Chengzong, it is not enough to make the lack of national library. In the first month of 1307, Yuan Chengzong rushed, and the brother of Hai Mountain, Li Yu Li, Octob, and the right-handed Harbin launched a majority of coup. Yuan Wu Zong was actually actually actually in love, and the book seal him as an emperor (ie the future Yuanren), and the Wu Zong system and the benevolence department were alternately called the emperor, that is, Wu Renzhi. During Yuan Wuzong period, Haifeng Confucius was \"Dacheng to Saint Wen Xuan Wang\" and gave Confucius's family and some title. In order to solve the fiscal crisis during Yuan Chengchong, Yuan Wuzong sets often in the flat coalis price, order to print to big silver banknotes, but in turn depreciate silver banknotes. In addition, he will give the Submission provincial and human rights to the province. 1311 Yuan Wuzong lost, by the Emperor Yutian Li Pulling Baota, which is Yuan Ren Zong, this time the Yuan Dynasty was inherited in the Yuan Dynasty.\n\nYuan Renzong is chasing the fiscal depletion caused by Yuan Wuzong, and the political chaos of the political and chaotic, he promoted the \"Confucianism\" policy, and the redundant staff, and strengthened the centralized centralization to rectify the government. Its Siyuan Yingzong continued to implement the policy of Confucianism, strengthening the central centralization and bureaucratic system, and ordered the compilation and promulgation of the official code of the official code. In the 1323, Yingzong was assassinated in the south of the south of the capital, and the history called Nanpo change. The calm and forests of the town and the forests of the Tiemutum are sold in the south, killing the rocky minister of the rut hike, called the emperor, that is, Thai Di Di.\n\nTaiddi collapsed in July 1328, the seven-year-old A Siji eight is the emperor, it is Tian Shun Emperor. The swing of the swordsman, and the Bo Yan, who established Zhou Wang and the world in the mobei, Huai Wang map, Siergang, the same year's map, gay first to most, is Yuan Wenzong. Yan Yinmu led the army to go to the capital, Tian Shun Emperor did not know the final. In the past few years, the world is in the north and the forest, that is, Yuan Mingzong. Yuan Wenzong gave up the emperor, sent Yan Yumu to the Yuanyuan, and was established as an emperor. However, Yan Yinmu poisoned Yuan Mingzong, resetting Yuan Wenzong, reformed the emilings, and the history of the historical calendar.\n\nAfter the death of Wen Zong in 1333, the seven-year-old Mingzi's mutual ceremony is the emperor, which is Yuanning Zong. However, Yuan Ningzong only died in two months, soon, Hua Ter was also dead. Yuan Mingzong's eldest son carefully sticked to Wen Zong Queen's Remnant from Jingjiang (Guangxi Guilin), it was an emperor, which is Yuan Huizong. Yuan Dynasty is in the long-term inheritance issue, corruption, power, and abroad, make politics can't be able to go to track. This unstable court will often lead to the coverage of the country. In the late Yuan Dynasty, especially in the middle of the 1940s to the 1940s, during the drought, the plague and the water were often occurred, and the water affected in the Yellow River is particularly serious. In the 1351, the incident of the Red Cowm, unveiled the dying of the militarity.\n\nThe Yuan Ting sent a soldiers to suppress the red towel army, and the prime minister took off personally led the army to attack Xuzhou Sesia Li Jun, and once pressed the people. However, in the middle of 1354, the departure of Zhang Shijun, who was killed by the minister of the Yuan Ting. Xu Shouhui finally split into two lakes of Chen Youzhi and Ming Yuzhen in Sichuan. The Minhuai Guo Zixing's department Zhu Yuanzhang began to expand the site for the basis of Nanjing in 1356; in 1363, there were two lakes, and finally won the victory in Poyang Lake; in 1365, the two lakes were taken after the same year's winter East offensive. Zhang Shi Cheng, along the sea; after the flatness of Zhang Shicheng in 1367, he continued to suppress Zhejiang's Fang Guozhen in the south. So, there was no one in Jiangnan against Zhu Yuanzhang. In addition, Fujian had a columns in the 1357 to 1366, and the history said that the history is also a chaos. At the same time, the Yuan Dynasty took the Yuan army against the Northern Red Towel Army in the Champion, and the Northern Red Towel Army in the Northern Red Towel Army was defeated to Zhang Shicheng after the Yuan Dynasty. Liu Fangtong was dead, Han Liner south Going to Zhu Yuanzhang and then killed. After the unification of Jiangnan, Zhu Yuanzhang ordered the Northern Expedition in 1367. He sent Xu Da. He often attacked Shandong and Henan, and blocked the Shaoguan to prevent the Central Plains of China. The Ming army captured in the August 1368, Yuan Huinzong North Eshan, the history book called this as the end of the Yuan Dynasty. However, the Yuan Ting is still on, and the history book is called the North. And the Ming Ting believes that Yuan Huizong is Shuntian Ming, and the number is Yuan Shun Emperor.\n\nIn the end of the Yuan Dynasty, officials were corrupted and polished. In order to eliminate the deficit, the Yuan Ting is added to the tax, a lot of print the new bank \"to the Bao Bao\", and the inflation arising from the inflation, the flood of the Yellow River, so that the people will not talk. In 1351, Yuan Shunji Jaru govern the Yellow River and tested more than 200,000 people. In May, Bai Lian, Han Mountain, and Liu Fangtong incited the people who were suffering from natural disasters and supervisors. Establishing a red towel army. According to Henan and Anhui and other places. The Red Towel Army has a matter of one after another, and the power is expanding to China, South China. In the past, the Guo Zixing of the Red Scarf Army gathered the public, captured Zhuzhou (now Anhui Fengyang). Soon, Zhu Yuanzhang shouted to Guo Zixing, repeatedly served, and got Guo Zixing's weight and trust. After that, Zhu Yuanzhang left the state and develop his forces. In 1356, Zhu Yuanzhang led the soldiers to occupy the celebration (now Nanjing, Jiangsu Province), renamed as the Tianfu, and attacked some of the military to get a foothold. After several years of hard work, its military and economic strength quickly grown. In 1363, through the Poyang Lake Water War, Chen Youmei was eliminated. In 1367, Zhu Yuanzhang claimed to Wu Wang, led the army to attack the Pingjiang (now Suzhou City, Jiangsu Province), destroy Zhang Shicheng, and destroyed the Shengguo Zhen from the coast of Zhejiang.\n\nIn the first month of 1368, Zhu Yuanzhang called the emperor in Nanjing, namely Ming Taizu, the year, Hongwu, and established. In the same year, I captured a large number of yuan, and the Yuan dynasty was withdrawn from the Central Plains and the end of the country. After 1371, the Sichuan Ming Yuzhen forces were destroyed. In the 1381, the Yuan Dynasty, the Yuan Dynasty, the Yuan Dynasty, who was guarded in Yunnan. Finally, in 13 In the 88 years, it deeply enters the North.\n\nOn the other hand, Ming Taizuhong might relieves the burden on the farmers, restores the economic production of society, the bad rule of the reform, and punish the bureaucrats of corruption, the social economy is restored and developed, and the history of Hongwu is. Ming Taizu strengthens the empowerment through a series of slaughter and specialist surveillance and other ways, and seals the sons as the king to strengthen the border defense, and the royal royal family. In the king, the king of the north is strong, and the power of Yan Wang Zhu Xi is the greatest. In 1398, Hong Wu Emperor drove, because the Prince Zhu Biao died early, by the Empress Taishun Zhu Yunzhen, the annual construction, that is, Jianwen. In order to consolidate the power of the empowerment, and the secretary of the minister, Qi Tai, Huang Zicheng and others. As a result, Yan Wang Zhu Xi took the \"Qingjun side, Jing Net difficult\" in Yao Guangxiao, and finally wandered back to south, and occupied the capital of Jing. Zhu Xi is like, that is, Ming Cheng ancestors, Yongle. Jian Wenmili lost in the hall of Miyagi.\n\nIn the treatment of flourishing, Ming Chengzu, Ming Renzong and Ming Xuan Zong have once again risen to Yongle Shengshi and Renxuan, which is one of the prosperity of the Ming Dynasty. Yongle Emperor attacked Annan, incorporating Annan into the Ming Dynasty layout, set up an intersection to rendering the politics. After the Ming Chengzu, I personally fifthally, I was in the north to attack the Northern element division. Ming Chengzu is a safe place in the Northeast Women's Real (located in the upstream of Songhua River) and Jianzhou Female Real (located between Songhua River, between Songhua River, Mudanjiang), and sent a martial arts, and the wilderness in the downstream of Heilongjiang. . In 1407, there was also a joy of the east bank from the lower reaches of Heilongjiang (the old land of the East Marshal House). Since 1405, I will send the official Zheng He Xia to the West, interacting to countries, declaring Weide and establishing a tribute system, Zheng He's western and seven times, the fleet footprint is covered with Southeast Asia, South Asia, Arabia and East Africa. The scale is unprecedented, expanding the influence of the Ming Dynasty to Nanyang and Western China. In terms of cultivation, Ming Chengu has a large-scale book \"Yongle Code\". In 1405, the ancestor will be renamed Beiping Beijing, 1421. Because of the world of the world, and vigorously develop overseas exchange, some scholars will call this period as Yongle Shengshi. However, Ming Chengzu also killed the opposition, such as Huang Zicheng, Qi Tai and other Ming Hui Zong, the old minister, etc. were killed.\n\nAfter the ancestral driving, his long Mingren, the year, Hong Xi. Hong Xi is 47 years old, the age has been high, and it is only a year. Its rule is biased towards the conservative, appoints \"San Yang\" (Yang Shiqi, Yang Rong, Yang Wei) and other Xianchen assistant, stop Zheng He, the western and foreign war, and encourages production, and the province, and strive. Ming Renzong's driving, the eldest son Zhu Zhanji is in place, which is for Ming Xuanzong, and the annual number. Xuan Dempasically inherited the father's route, and implemented German political countries and let Zheng He under the western ocean. Ming Xuanzong also loves art, there is painting. However, there is no disadvantage during its ruling period. Since Ming Xuanzong is hurts (the ancient name \"to promote\"), many bureaucrats have ranted to shoot horses, known as \"woven sky\". At the same time, Xuan Demper broke the rules left by Hongwu Emperor, and some eunuchs were governed by Wang Zhen and others, and the eunuchs were dedicated to the Mingzhong Ye. In 1435, Xuanzong died, and the nine-year-old Zhu Xi Town is in place, namely Ming Zong, the annual owner.\n\nAfter 1440 years, the wattle of the western Mongolia is gradually strong, often in the Ming Dynasty border. In 1449, Ming Yingzong Zhu Xi Town was defeated in the civil fort, although the Vajun army was defeated when the Vauguan defeated the war in Beijing, but the Ming Dynasty was no longer like Yongle, Hong Xi, Xuande's prosperous, started to decline, and territorial No longer expand, and strengthen the border defense and build the Great Wall.\n\nMing Yingzong was captured, the throne is out of stock, and the emperor of the meat ticket in the hand is constantly going to the Ming Dynasty. The Wei Chen is in the midnight of the Uri Yingzong, and the Tzochi is resistant to the tile. The English in the hand has become a valuable Tai Shang, so I promised the requirements of U.S.\n\nAfter Britain returned to Beijing, he was strictly monitored by the brother, but he was in the 1457-year-old hunting, and he became the only emperor who used the two Years of the Ming Dynasty.\n\nAfter the British, the Qing Dynasty was diligent in the early years, and the pets were pets to believe in Guifei and the official Wang Dynasty.

During the Wanli New Year, Japan Tai Wai Ji Ji Ji launched the DPRK, making the Ming Dynasty into a large number of troops and military expenses to clear the Japanese army, and the national power consumes very small, but the North Korean is re-in the Control of Ming Dynasty. Later, Ming Zongzong did not undergo reluctance, and politically increasingly corrupt.\n\nMing Guangzong took the throne of the emperor's hand, but suddenly drove in a month, he was inherited by his son. Tianqi Emperor Qi Zong likes carpenter to work, apprentice Wei Zhongxian to share the business of the court, Wei Zhongxian has held the political affairs, causing Donglin Party, and has more political, and more faded in the country.\n\nIn 1626, Wang Gongfeng, Wang Gongfeng, Wang Gongfeng, Wang Gongfeng, in the southwest of Beijing, killed more than 20,000 deaths [6].

The North Korean North Korea has long been one of the people of the country. Only Japan, which is only the river is in the lock of the country, and there is little in the Qing Dynasty.

In 2012, Wang Lijun incident, Bo Xilai incident broke out, received extensive attention.\n\nOn May 12, 2008, a Wenchuan earthquake occurred in Sichuan Province, a total of 69,227 to 300,000 people were killed, 37,4643 injured, and 17923 were missing. It is the largest earthquake in the founding of the People's Republic of China [36], which is also the most calm amount of casualties after the earthquake in Tangshan [37]. The earthquake caused a total of 845.1 billion yuan in the disaster area of \u200b\u200bSichuan, Gansu, Shaanxi, etc., and the health, housing, school building, communication, transportation, public security, landform, water conservancy, ecological, minority culture, etc. were severely damaged.\n\nAfter the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2012, Xi Jinping was as director of the Central Committee of the Central Committee, and Li Keqiang served as Prime Minister of the State Council and marked the Fifth-generation leadership collective. The two have created a Peari system, and the national rejuvenation as a goal, explains the \"Chinese Dream\" to actively fight corruption, requiring officials to implement the eight provisions of the Central Committee, reorganize the government departments, deepen economic transformation and reform. The new government has caused a huge response in mainland China society.\n\nIn September and October 2013, the Chinese government proposed a cooperation initiative to build \"all the way\", \"New Silk Road Economic Belt\" and \"21st Century Maritime Silk Road\". The Chinese government pointed out that \"a belt all the way\" initiative adheres to the principle of contending, building, sharing, and strives to achieve more perfect, more secure and efficient to form a higher level of land sea-air communication network. At the same time, the convenience of investment trade is more efficient, and high quality, high standards of free trade zone network is established. In order to make the economics along the world more closely, political mutual trust is more in-depth, human communication is more extensive. [38]\n\nFrom November 10th to 11th, 2014, the annual meeting of the 26th Asia-Pacific OECD leader was held in Yanqi Lagui, Huairou District, Beijing. The Summit adopted the \"Declaration of the 22nd Leaders of the Asia-Pacific OECD\" (\"Beijing Program (Declaration)\") [39], proposed and committed to the \"Beijing Anti-Corruption Declaration\" \u65e8 \u5728 \u5728 \u5728 [ 40] China began to reveal its global influence. [41] In 2015, the \"TMB\" was held in Singapore, which is the first meeting of the highest leaders since 1949 since 1949 in 1949. Since 2018, a new round of Sino-US trade war is open. Since May 2020, China and India have erupted border conflicts, causing casualties.\n\nAfter Hong Kong sovereignty transferred to China, some Hong Kong people did not satisfy the interference of the central government to Hong Kong elections, requiring \"true\" universal elections, that is, \"citizen nomination\" elections. 2014 launched the occupation of the Central Ring (Umbrella Revolution) to request the National People's Congress to withdraw the resolution. The occupation action ended on December 15, 2014, lasted 79 days. In 2019, Hong Kong broke out the global \"Amendment of the Draft Movement of the Randards\", referred to as \"reverse\", the violent action between the two sides of the Hong Kong police and the demonstrators made Hong Kong's safety and the rule of law were severely damaged, and the tourism industry was close to collapse. The Hong Kong regional economy is seriously frustrated. [42]\n\nIn 2018, the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee proposed that the 13th National People's Congress revised the Constitution to delete the country's chairman and did not exceed the limit of the two sessions. [43] [44] The two of the Central Committee of Xi Jinping and the President of the Central Military Commission have no term restrictions, abolishing the restriction of the national chairman, meaning that he can become a lifelong leader after Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Communist Party of China. . [45] Scholars and media believe that Xi Jinping's practice is like the imitation of Yuan Shikai, \"The Emperor\" [46] \"The Watrich Cadres and Leading Directory\" in Deng Xiaoping, was broken by Xi Jinping. At the same time, vocabulary such as \"Yuan Shikai\" and \"restoration\" is blocked by the network [47].\n\nAfter the death of the coronary virus, Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the CPC, has always emphasized that he personally commanded epidemic prevention, and \"seeking\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \" The speech at the time of coronavirus pneumonia epidemic \"shows that early January 7 has been proposed in the Standing Committee of the Central Political Bureau [48] [49]. With the successful control of the epidemic, China's economic growth is 2.3% [50], better than expected [51], China is not only the only major economy in the world, but also the total GDP has also achieved hundreds of trillion history. Break through [52] [53] [54].\n\nAt the same time, mainland China is also facing huge challenges, mainly in the global financial crisis, single dependence on foreign trade exports, environmental pollution, natural disasters, and increasing social rich gaps, corruption, some ethnic groups because of historical grievances Split activities of history, some local governments have dissatisfied people, and the contradiction between the aging of the future population structure and the overall population foundation.\n\nSince the National Government of the Republic of China, the Government of the People's Republic of China, the Government and the Chinese government of the People's Republic of China claim that they are the only legal Chinese government and negate each other. Since the United Nations seat of the Republic of China from the People's Republic of China, the vast majority of the international community believes that the People's Republic of China is a regime representing China; on the other hand, most of the international communities do not recognize that the Republic of China is sovereign, only non-official Relationship, but there are still 15 countries to admit that the Chinese government represents the government of China.\n\nOfficials on both sides of Taihai began to have interactive relationships in the 1980s and conduct a series of political and cultural exchanges in the next few years. In 2000, the Republic of China realized the first peaceful political parties, the new President Chen Shui-bian government was biased towards the \"China\" attitude towards \"China\" on both sides of the Taiwan Sea. In 2008, the Chinese Nationalist Party's Ma Yingzhi was elected the president of the Republic of China, the second peace political parties, deepened with the nine two consensus and mainland in the middle of the middle, and \"unwanted, not alone, not Wu\" as a cross-strait relationship in principle. In recent years, Taiwanese has declined to \"China\", and according to the investigation of the National Political University Election Research Center, only 2.4% of people think that they are Chinese, and 67% believe that they are Taiwanese. It is considered to be 27.5% of the Taiwanese and Chinese. [55]\n\nRecently, the Government of the People's Republic of China has facing the relevant issues related to the sovereignty of the Republic of China, and the attitude is tough. Taiwan is part of the Territory of the People's Republic of China. As a definition of China, it is the definition of China, and \"Peaceful Unity\" is the main shaft, \"a country, two systems\" as a treasure sea The framework of the two sides of the strait, intend to rule the Taiwan region to the People's Republic of China; the Chinese government, China National Party and other flora camps adhere to a Chinese and Jiuyi consensus [Note 3]; democratic progress party and the Taiwan Unity Alliance emphasize Taiwan's local awareness Need for the existence of nine two consensus.

In a certain aspect, the ancient myths will be assumed to be a true part of the history [1], the initial text record on the Chinese myth can be recorded in \"Shanhai Jing\", \"Water Take\", \"Shang Shu\", \"Jiu Song\", \"Historical Record\", \"Book\", \"Chu\", \"Lv Spring and Autumn\", \"Mandarin\", \"Zuo Chuan\", \"Huainanzi\", etc. Ancient Han classics [2].\n\nLike my words of other nations, when China's ancient myth is from the primitive society, human beings try to make reasonable interpretations through reasoning and imagination, but because of the low level of knowledge at the time, it is often covered with a mysterious color.\n\nOn the other hand, the ancient mythology is also the epitome of the ancient society, and most of the characters in myth come from the original human body. For example, the hunting tribe, most of the myths are related to hunting; the tribes of farming, and the myths created are related to agriculture.\n\nThe following is some insights proposed by the scholars on mythology:\n\nAccording to the classification of Chinese mythology, Yuan Wei, now the Chinese myths can be divided into three kinds of \"myth\", \"legend\" and \"fairy\" [6] [7]:\n\nAlthough scholars subdivided the Chinese mythology into three categories, the priests ever joined in mythology, and the people generally mix the three as a talk, for example, explanation:\nIn mythology, Panggu used an ax to smash the heavens, and finally his body also turned into a world; but in the fairy words, the ancient caucasian cactus called \"Yuan Shi Tian Wang\", and he and A fairy called \"Taiyuan Jade\", gave birth to a son called \"Emperor\" [8].\n\nWith regard to the characteristics of Chinese myths, scholars in different fields will put their own focus on their familiar areas and develop different perspectives. Chinese literatists generally put the focus on its literature and think it is [9]:\n\nSince the prosperity of Taoism, the Taoist Taoists added their own concepts and repair methods to the ancient myth or other religious beliefs, and gradually developed three clear gods. , The fairy system of the Yuhuang, the three officials. Nowadays, Taoist Taoists, in addition to the concepts and methods of Taoism itself, all the things in the ancient times are spiritual, the ancestors worship and totem worship.\n\nIn the Jin Dynasty to the Ming and Qing Dynasties, there was a category called \"ambiguity novel\" or \"god novel\" in the history of Chinese literature. It mainly tells the \"God\", \"Ghost\", \"Xian\", \"Demon\" , \"Fine\", \"strange\", \"Buddha\", \"Magic\" story, a lot of refers to myth, legend and fairy, and the famous \"Feng Shen Romance\", \"Journey\", \"Mirror Flower \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\n\nThe creation of the Han nationality combines Confucian literature, Taoist literature and folk beliefs. However, the narrative between different versions often have conflict, and who is \"the first person\" in Chinese myths, according to the times There were several statements such as God, Day, Female, Pangu and Jade Emperor:\n\nThe characters in the ancient mythum era were condensed into the early tribe of the mother of the mother.\n\nAfter the woman's death, the world is the three emperors and five emperors. The era is about the second year before the Jiyuan, and these leaders were considered a model of Shengming and morality. Since the past, each of the students have real identity for the three emperors. There are differences, the most commonly accepted, from histei and still books:\n\nAccording to legend, in the era of the emperor, the floods of the world were flooded, and the order was ruined for nine years without fault; when the taste was successful, the son who was dead and ordered was to treat water. After reviewing the failure of the failed, the method of reforming the water with Yong Hai, after thirteen years, finally gotting big water. After the success of the water, the emperor Feng Feng is Bo, and the Summer (now Henan) is the country; the emperor is in the 33rd year, the Zen of the emperor will give the emperor, because he is the great achievement of water, then the world Tell him to Daxie.\n\nRegarding the establishment of Xia Dynasty, several different statements were circulated in the book, and the most common acceptance was:\nWhen the emperor was in place, the leader who was originally interested in the east is the successor, but Yao Tao is died in the past, and the son of the emperor and the son of the Tao is beneficial to the heir. Shortly after the death of the emperor, the son of \u542f \u542f \u63a8 \u81ea \u81ea \u4e3a \u738b \u81ea \u81ea \u81ea \u81ea \u81ea \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u81ea \u738b \u738b \u738b \u738b \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u5236 \u671d \u671d \u671d\n\nXia Dynasty was thought of being a half myth, although the number of 17 emperors of Xia Dynasty in the history and bamboo book year, the archaeologist later found a complete palace site in the second direction (now Henan Yanshi). , Called the Embarm Site.\n\nHowever, there has not been found to prove that the ruins of Xia Chao.\n\nAccording to legend, the last emperor of Xia Dynasty was a huge tyrant, the leader of the business tribe, the leader of the other tribes overturned Xia Xuan. The rule of Shang Dynasty was about 1600 to 1046 before the Western Yuan, and the initial movement was moved; when the Pan Geng successive, Deliu (now Henan Anyang). The last emperor of Shang Dynasty was in place, and the first 1046th, Zhou Wuwang was jointly attacked to the song, and the emperor was self-contained in the Roucai, and the Shang Dynasty was destroyed.\n\nThe archeologist discovered by the Yin Ruins of the Merchant Civilization; however, the Xia Shang Annual Table still has a lot of disputes. The demineralization of Shang Dynasty and the establishment of the Zhou Dynasty constituted the main content of Feng Shen's Romance. The Tianmi, the people of Shang Dynasty, is the God of the Oriental Image / System, inheriting from the Cancel of Chinese Culture.

The relationship between music and human feelings is greatly attached, \"The Book of Songs\", \"Book of Books, Music\", \"Xunzi \u00b7 Music Articles\", \"Historical Records,\" Enlightenment role. At the same time, from the Huqin of the Tang Dynasty, Chinese music and the process of absorbing foreign music elements have been constantly developing.\n\n\n\nAncient Chinese poetry, songs are not divided, ie, literature and music are closely related. The poems in the \"The Book of Songs\" in the \"Book of Songs\" in the existing Chinese poetry have been equipped with tunes. It has been singing, and this tradition has continued. The official poetry of the Han Dynasty integrates \"Han Lefu\", Tang Poetry, and Song Wan can also sing. Modern also musicians sing for ancient poems, such as Su Shi descriptions of \"Water Song\" in Mid-Autumn Festival.\n\nDuring the government, there are departments specializing in music, used for sacrifices, banquet, etc. The \"emot\" for the noble entertainment is often not recorded, and the famous singer Li Turtle in the Tang Dynasty also often appeared in Tang poetry. The \"Qin Qian\" of the ancient Chinese \"Scholar\", \"Qin\" refers to Guqin, and Guqin Music is often appreciated by the scholar, and their research on Guqin has formed \"piano\". The two generations of the two generations published a lot of piano, the piano book, and the literature is very rich, and a lot of piano is formed.\n\nThe ancient Chinese music belongs to the five-sound order system, five levels of five-sound order are called \"five\", respectively, for the palace, business, angle, sage, feather.\n\nChinese music can be traced back to 9000 years ago. The Jiahu \u7b1b unearthed in the Jahu site is about 9000 to 7500. [1] It is about 7,000 years, and there are postures from all over the world.\n\nGe Tianshi \"Three people fuck tails, sufficient to sing eight \u9615\", visible to the characteristics of the ancient music culture with songs, dances and music. \"Jing Tiandong\", \"Fully Grand Valley\", \"The Total Bad\" reflects the awareness of the predecessor of agriculture, animal husbandry and natural laws. These songs, dances, and music are also in contact with the original clan totem worship. For example, the Huangdi clan once with clouds, his music is called \"Yunmen\". Regarding the original song form, \"Lu Shu Spring and Autumn\" recorded the female \"Waiting\" lyrics only \"Waiter\", but only \"Teller\" is in an intention. This is the germination of music, is a pregnant language.\n\nLegend has it \"Fuxi, Shennong, Qinhe\". Fuxi piano, big arrived in the grass creation, failed to improve, sent to Shennong, Shennong added another research, so the system of Qinsse, becoming the system. [2]. There is also the music rhythm, making songs and dances, Yang extension scores, big capacity, Huang Emperor, \u5914 \u5914, \u4f26, \u5c06 \u949f \u4f20 \u4f20 \u4f20 \u4f20 \u4f20\n\nThe music dance gradually detached from the characteristics of \"the original clan and dance as the class\". From the content, they gradually left the original totem worship, turned to the song of people who conquered nature. For example, Xia Bazhi, benefiting the people, and has a \"big summer\" who has praised Xia Wei. There is no way, there is no way, the merchant soup, there is a song \"big\". The Shang Dynasty witch is prevalent, so there is a special sacrifice (witch) and \u89cb (men), dance, singing, singing, is the earliest person.\n\nThe chieple is happy to dance, and the ancestors will enjoy the feelings of the sensory with the music dance, reflecting the productivity compared to the original era, thus enabling the music culture. Legend has it that there is a crocodile-skinned drum, and the business is a wooden pypet drum, a bronze drum, a chime, and a chick.\n\nTao Hao in 5,000 years ago, from the monosh hole in the time, 2 tone holes to 5 syndrome, can issue 12 cycles of listeners. According to the pronunciation of the Tao Hao, the five-sound order appeared in the late Dynasties of the Neolithic Age, and the seven-sound order is at least in business, and the Yin period appeared.\n\nIn the Western Zhou period, the court was first established a complete ritual music system. Qing Liu Baoan \"The Analects of Confucius\": \"The left \u2027 hidden five years\" test the Zhongzi's public will be, the question is in the Zhong, the Zhongzi: \"\u5929\u5b50Use eight, princes with six, doctor four, taxi two. \"\" Deliked \"Zuo Zhiyi\": \"The sky is eight eight, the princes, the doctor's four eight, the second eight.\"\n\nThe representative dance has the \"cloud gate\" of the Yellow Emperor, \"Xianchi\", \"big\", \"big summer\", \"big summer\", and time \"Da Wu\", collects \"big dance\" or \"six generations\".\n\nZhou Dong has a survey system, collect folk songs, to watch the customs, and observe the people. I have retained a lot of folk songs, and I have been deleted by Confucius, forming the \"Book of Songs\" in China's first poem. It has a total of more than 500 years from the beginning of the Xi Zhou to the spring and autumn. The classification of the \"Book of Songs\", there is a \"four beginning six righteous\". \"Four\" refers to the first poems of the first poems of \"wind\", \"\u5927\u96c5\", \"\u5c0f\u96c5\" and \"\u9882\". \"Six\" refers to \"wind, elegance, \u9882,, ratio, Xing\". \"Wind, Ya, Yan\" is the difference between the \"Book of Songs\" in accordance with the \"Book of Book of Songs\", \"Fu, Bi, and Xing\" is the \"Book of Songs\". The climax part of the tail of the song has a special name \"chaos\".\n\nBefore and after the \"Book of Songs\", Qu Yuan's \"Nine Song\" prepared to be originally adapted and processed by the singing and performance of the Civil sacrifies God of Chu, and wrote a poem with elegant poetry. It has a strong Chu culture characteristics.\n\nIn 1978, there were 8 124 instruments, including important Zeng Hou B, Zeng Hou B, and Zeng Hou B, provided a large amount of information on the court music, including musical instrument, performance, and twelve law. Sound name, rotary palace method, etc.\n\nThe natural laws produced by the \"Three-Piercing Law\" as records recorded in \"Pipe \u2027\" have issued natural pronunciation, which is a multiplication of frequency, so it sounds a harmonious voice, but it will cause \"Huang Zhong can't restore\" .\n\n\"Yuefu\" began in Qin Han. It inherited the Zhou Dynasty to collect the style, collected, collected and changing folk music, and concentrated in a large number of music work in the banquet, suburban, and asked. These lyrics used to sing, known as Yuefu poetry. Yuefu, later was introduced to lyrics from all kinds of enlightened or unhappy music, even some opera and instruments were also called Yuefu.\n\nThe main song form of the Han Dynasty is \"phase and song\". It sang from the initial \"one person singing, three people and\" gradually developed as a \"phase and big song\" accompanied by silk, bamboo, and the structure of \"Yan, tend to be chaos\", which is against Sui, Tang The song and dance big songs have an important impact. At the time of the Han Dynasty, the northwestern frontier was happy. It constitutes a variety of advocities in a variety of advocities, such as cross blowing, riding, yellow gates, etc. They are played immediately, or played in the way, used for military music etiquette, court feast and folk entertainment. Today's folk is blowing, when there is an inclination of the Han Dynasty. \"Bai Du\" is a program that plays songs and dances, acrobatics, and angles.\n\nThe Act of Han Dynasty is that the Beijing Township will be divided into sixty laws in the Beijing-Branch of profit and loss. This kind of theory is meaningless in music practice, but reflects the fineness of rhythmic thinking. From the theory to achieve the effect of \"53 average\".\n\nThe ancient Chinese Yale has lost his court in the palace in the Eastern Han Dynasty. Cao Cao found the Du Yu, which was proficient in Yale, so that Yare returned, Huang Zhong Da Lu returned to the court. The ritual system is returned.\n\nQing Shangyue, which is developed by the Qing Dynasty and the songs, is greatly developed by the love of Cao Cao's father. The large number of Yuefu poems left by Cao Cao is the lyrics used to sing. When Cao Yu, officially established a Music Institution to settle up to Liang Chen, and set up a clear business office. The war of the two Jin Jin, so that the Qing Dynasty will flow into the south, combined with the Southern folk songs, the West Ring, forming a different kind of business music that is different from the song. In the northern Wei Xiaowen Emperor, the Qing Daxi collected collected, so that China's important music with Ya Mer, Hu Le, is known as \"Huaxia Positive\". Since the Han Dynasty, with the smooth flow of the Silk Road, the songs in the Western Regions began to pass. When I was cold, Lu Guang took the turtle to Tuo music in Sui Tang Yanle to the middle and soil.\n\nGuqin art tends to mature, and the ancient Qun monograph \"Qinyao\" in the Han Dynasty has appeared in the Han Dynasty. When Wei Jin, He Kang, in his book, \"Qin Fu\", has a record of \"Yuci\" in Zhongshan. This indicates that people at the time have known the generation of quotation of the logo on the ancient Qun. At that time, a large number of literati family appeared, such as Cai Wei, Kang Kang, Ruan Ji, \"Guangling\" (\"Nie Zhengteng Qin Wang\"), \"\u7317 \u7317 \u64cd\", \"\u7317 \u64cd\", \"\u9152 \u64cd\" and other famous piano came out.\n\nThis period of rhythm is an important achievement, including the \"Voice Catalog\" of the Jin Dynasty. In the Southern Dynasties, the Song Song, in the three-point profit and loss method, with an equal difference column, superposition principle, and found a new rhythm near the twelve average law, and initially solved the problem of the three-point damage to the Huang Zhong can't restore.\n\nThe two generations of Sui Tang, the unity of regimes, especially the Tang Dynasty, political stability, prosperity, rulers pursue open policies, constantly absorbing other cultures, plus the Wei Jin, have already gave birth to the music culture integration, finally germination The peak of music art of music art for song and dance is the highest development of music art.\n\nThe music enjoyed by the court feast of the Tang Dynasty, called \"Yan Le\".

In a Song Dynasty tomb unearthed in the Henan Province, the \"Song Yilu actor Dingdu Same Brick\" was discovered in China's existing cultural relics in China's first recorded drama performance. After the name of \"Opera\", \"Chinese Traditional Drama\" is referred to as \"Chinese Traditional Drama\", and the \"Song Dynasty\" is the first to \"opera\", and the Chinese traditional drama will be pushed first. The \"Chinese Traditional Drama\" is the special name of \"Chinese traditional drama\".\n\nWang Guowei will define the \"singing and dancing story\", but also pointed out that the spoken is an important feature of the drama different from other texts. From this definition, the opera must have basic elements such as actors, theater, poetry, dance, music, spokes, and stories. Taiwanese scholar Zeng Yisheng will regard Wang Guodian's definition of the opera as the condition that the drama small play must have, and the performance art of the small play is relatively primitive.

In 2009 and 2010, the Cantonese Opera, Trends and Peking Opera have been included in the world-class intangible cultural heritage and opera art further from the world. [1]\n\nAccording to the installment, Chinese operas include:\n\nAccording to the data of the China Art Research Institute, in the late 1960s, the early 1960s, the Type of Leap forward, China has 367 drama drama, including more than 50 newly created dramas (ie, emerging drama); in 1982, \"China The investigation statistics for the compilation of the Baskkooks \u00b7 Opera Volumes have found that there are still 317 dramas at that time; in 2005, only 267 dramas were left [2].\n\nIn many drama, Kunqu and Peking Opera are considered to be the highest model of traditional Chinese drama [3], other common dramas have Henan Opera, Cantonese Opera, Yue Opera, Huangmei Opera, Event, etc.\n\nCoala (the ancient book, Hu Yizuo), Taiwan's cloth bag, Nan Direction (seven son, nine \", North management (chaos), shadow play, \u5080\u5121, Hakka Drama, Peking Opera, Yu Opera, Kunqu, Huangmei Opera , Three-foot tea show, praise, local song, car drum, cow plow, bamboo array, seven-ring, moline Wikipedia has not yet the same article as the above title.

From the earliest government files to the mature vanile novels that have emerged for entertainment to entertainment to entertainment. In Chinese, the word \"literature\" is the earliest \"Analects, Advanced\". In this festival, Confucius can divide students into four categories: virtue, speech, political affairs, literature, and later, it is called \"Confucius Siki Ten Zhe\". [1] [2] According to the Northern Song Dynasty, Xing Wei is the \"Article Bao\", which means that many ancient and modern literature and learning. In this statement, it is a culture that can be interpreted as awareness or by this. If the literature can be seen in the current narrow statement, literature can be seen in the four schools established by the Song Dynasty in the South Dynasty: Confucianism, Metaphysics, Historiography, Literature. After that, \"literary biography\" acting in the right to act \"is this. However, that kind of literature is only a literature representing the upper class, does not include the mainstream literature like a novel, drama, or modern Chinese literature. Therefore, when we talk about \"Chinese literature\", we should pay attention to the difference in literary concepts between the ancients and modern academics.\n\nIn addition, since ancient times, Chinese literature includes politics, many works are in real life, and there are also a lot of literary works from politics. Just like the famous sayings of Cao Yu in the Times: \"The article, the majority of the country, the immortal event.\" It is pointed out that the Chinese people believe that literature has a strong force, literature and politics have close relationships. Therefore, since the Song Dynasty, the reason why literature from the bureaucrats is also an influence of this idea, which is also a special place in Chinese literature. Affected by the concept of the heavens, there is no obvious boundary between Chinese literature and theology.\n\nSince ancient times, Chinese literature has always been the mainstream of rhyme, especially many of the theme of painting natural scenery and singing friendship, etc. In contrast, although the narrative poems are not developed, the ancient \"Book of Books\", Han Lifu \"Peacock Southeast Flight\", \"Mulan\", etc. from the North Dynasty folk songs, etc. It is also a famous work. If you do not count the articles of history, religion, thinking, etc., the prose literature is initially prosperous in the Tang Dynasty. The theme of the prose, in addition to some exceptions, many works are not purely creation but are reality, and this tradition has been maintained for a long time until the novel period born under the influence of Western European civilization. Also, we must pay attention to the word in ancient Chinese rhyme prose and it is said to be a literary meaning, but it is better to say that it is a name that is in style. In addition, there is a stylist called \u9a88 \u6587.\n\nIn China's long history, there are many dynasties, and some nations are also sitting on the throne of this land. Although the inflow of foreign cultures also has a certain impact on literature, in general, Chinese literature refers to literature created by Chinese characters and Chinese.\n\nChinese and Han Po also impact on Japanese and Japanese literature.\n\nThe Book of Book was originally named \"Poem\", and he was respected as a poem after the establishment of Dr. Five Classics in the Western Han Dynasty. [3] Since the poetry has a total of 305 poems, [4] takes the approximate number, so the world is also called \"three hundred\". [5] The six righteousness mentioned in the later generations, respectively: wind, elegance, \u9882,, ratio, Xing. The top three are the \"Book of Songs\", the last three is the literary technique of the \"Book of Songs\". [6] \"Wind\" refers to folk songs in the fifteen countries and all over the country. According to legend, Zhou Tianzi regular officials went to the folks to collect music, the reason is that folk songs reflect the lives of people, etc., there are many ironic works, which can be seen as a reality of reality; \"Ya\" points \"\u96c5\u96c5 \",\" Xiaoya \", is a movement that is playing when the noble feast;\" \"\" Zhou Yanyu \",\" Lu Yi \",\" Shang Yu \", is the music of the princes. \"Fu\", according to Zhu Xi \"Poetry Collection\", \"people who are in the words\", \"is also a kind of dedication;\" thanks, with the other, \"is a metaphorical method;\" The happiness, first words of others, \",\", \"to borrow other scenes, etc., as the beginning of poetry, play a role. The literary technique in the \"Book of Songs\" is except for the above three, and there is a double sound, stack, top, and so on. Among them, \"Reproduction Law\" is the main characteristics of many of the \"Book of Songs\". In short, a poem is divided into several sections. Each section is basically the same, but it will replace some words, the strong level of the words will be strong than one , Repeatedly, to collect three sighs. In addition, in the poem, especially the national style, a lot of four poems are the earliest four poems in China. The realism thinking in the Book of Songs, many phrase, literature and artistic techniques have far-reaching the future work writers. In the Spring and Autumn Period, Confucius believes that \"the Book of Songs\" \"Wen Jun Towns\", called \"Thinking\", and teaches the \"Book of Songs as textbooks, and the library of the later generations also includes the poetry into the examination range, is the hometown must read One of the works.\n\nMore famous poetry classes have \"Guan Yu\" \"\u84b9\u846d\" \"Tao Tao\" \"Moir\" and so on. Many poetry sentences have been quoted many times later, so become an idiom in Chinese, such as \"Sui Book\" (\"Book of Songs, Xiaoyu,\"), \"Hands of the Child, and the Son\" (\"\" The Book of Songs, the wind, the drum, \"\" \u4e0d \u521d \u521d, \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\"\n\nIn the Warring States era, there is a literary genre with \"Book of Songs\" in the Chu State of the Yangtze River in the south, generally called \"Chu\". The earliest records of the Chu claims are visible to the \"Historical Records and Qu Yuan Chuan\" of Sima Qian in Western Han Dynasty. The main writers of the chief are Qu Yuan (the first 340 - 278 years), in the world of Chu Huai, was exhausted, and when he was a king, There is \"Dai Sao\" \"Day asks\" \"Huai Sha\" and other works. In addition to Qu Yuan, there are also writers such as Song Yu and so on. Sima Qian did not use the name of \"Chu\". See \"Han Shu, Yi Wenzhi\", \"Qu Yuan Fu 25\", \"Song Yu Fu\" and so on, and pointed out that these works can not be sang, but they are deliberately read, calling themselves, etc. . To the Eastern Han, Wang Yi was composed of \"Chu Zhu Zhang\" (the second half of the second century), and supplemented with annotations, the book is today we call \"Chu\". The book mainly explains the work of politics, ethics, with Qu Yuan's life, but Zhu Xi's \"Chu Ring\" tried to jump away from political ethical perspectives and freely explained the saying.\n\nThe characteristics of the song, just as Huang Bisi in the Song Dynasty said in the \"school-oriented church\": \"Gay, Song Sao, all the book, as Chu, Madu, famous Chu, so there is\" \"(See\" Song Wen Jian \"Volume 92) It can be seen that it is created with a lot of the myths, things, dialects, etc. of Chu State. In the work, Qu Yuan has a lot of metaphor, such as vanilla beauty, with loyalty, bovine smell, with a ratio, can be said to be one of the most important romantic works in Chinese literature. \"Nine Songs\" saves the most old literacy of the Chu, and the content is mainly described in the world of the gods and the interaction of people. This is Qu Yuan's Shen Song Dance for the Chu State. \"Nine Chapters\" is the topic written by the distress of Qu Yuan's reality, waves and so on, and there are nine works. In addition to the above short articles, there is still a long, such as \"Day,\" \"Soul\", \"Dour\", etc. Song Yu has a \"nine arguments\" with the theme of sad autumn. Other works such as \"Fight\" \"Buju\" \"Fishing Male\" and so on, some people think it is Qu Yuan's work, but from the content and rhythm, it should be the work of the Han Dynasty.\n\nAmong the chief, the most mature work of the number is Qu Yuan's \"Liu Sao\", a total of three hundred sentences. The contents of the content is not expensive, there is excellent talent, but it is the world of doctrines. Although the protagonist is trying to save your own innocence, because the monarch is listening to the words, he will eventually lose trust. He continued to be self-sorrowful, one day decided to travel to find the ideal country. He roams in the air and myth world, and he continues to travel at sunset. Finally arrived at \"Tianmen\", but the emperor does not allow him to enter. Here, there is still a small person who is flattering. He continued to journey, unknown behind him, has already placed a column of peers. So, when he intends to leave the real world, fly on a high sky, he saw his hometown between the clouds. I feel hard to sit in my horses, and I will not go forward. In the end \"chaos\" part of the poem, I express my political ideals in the reality, I decided to go to Peng Xian 's residents, which also advocated the meaning of Fu Yuan. . From another perspective, you can also see the work as a tragedy of the heroic narrative poem. \"Lai\" is the most influence on the later generation, its name \"The road is long and the road is long, I will go up and down\" \"\" Years are really good, although the nine death is still unsettled \"is often used by the later generations.\n\nIf you open the mythical story of your mouth, China's earliest article is to count the Oracle text of Shang Dynasty and the golden text of the Zhou Dynasty. However, because both mainly describe the divination and simple political records, it can be seen as the origin of written language. If it is said that it is a generic origin of literature or in an immature stage. The origin of Chinese literature in literary prose, is as good as Sui Dynasty, \"The Hard Training \u00b7 Articles\" pointed out: \"Movie, the original five classics\". Five through the Confucian classic poems, books, courtesy, easy, spring and autumn. Regarding the \"Book of Songs\", Qing Dynasty Zhang Xuecheng \"Wen Shi Tong Poetry\" proposed: \"The text of the later generations, the body is all prepared in the Warring States, people do not know; its source is more than\" poetry \", people don't know.\" Taking the \"Book of Songs\" as the source of prose, that is, the \"Book of Songs\" is an element with poetry and prose. \"Book\", ancient call, \"book\", also called \"Shangshu\", its contents describe the political record of the ancient to Zhou dynasties, the language of the book is more solemn, the following is some Notice issued by Zhou Tianzi to the Demolition of the Yin Dynasty : [7]\n\nThe content is simple, but the vocabulary used in this is \"today\", \"\u60df\", \"\u5c14\", etc. has a grand and majestic feeling, the purpose is that if Yin Dynasty, the people, the people, the people, the realism and Effect of the style. \"Spring and Autumn\" is the history book of Lu Guo, and the legend is called by Confucius. In the description, the editor recorded the historical events in the age of the record, but the word is implied in the complant, and the content is surrounded by personnel and natural phenomena.\n\nFive words, roughly can inference is originated from the folk songs \"Yuefu\" in the last year of the Western Han Dynasty. Poetry is more fluctuated in five words, compared to the rustic and monotonous \"Book of Book of Books\", which is greatly expanded. There are many five-language poetry in the Lefu, and the content is the story, such as \"Peacock Southeast Flying\" is a total of 357 sentences.\n\nTo the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty, political chaos, social turmoil, and long-lasting five-way poems have been attached importance to the knowledge class seeking new literary genre, gradually applied to literary creation. If the author is unknown, \"the nineteen\" of ancient poems is the results of the five-language creation in this period. [8] Most of the works of \"The Ten Nine\" of Ancient Poems are mainly sorrowful singers, and the sorrow of people who love each other will be sigh. The fear of death, the life is short, such as Eleventh:\n\nThis poem is written by people from old to death until the feeling of death. The sad songs of \"The Ten Nine\" of Ancient Poems and the feeling of time until the Six Dynasties are still the main style of the five words.\n\nDuring the Western Han Dynasty, Sima moved to the \"Historical Record\" book, and the content is narrative, and the history of the Emperor Wu of the Western Han Dynasty is a good historical prose work, and China's first use of the history book of China's first use of the book. [9]\n\n\"Historical Records\" total 130 volumes, [10] a total of twelve cities, ten tables, eight books, thirty family and seventy column. This code is 12 volumes, describing the mains and related history; Table 10 volumes, the chance of spring and autumn, the Warring States, Qin at the end of the princes, 8 volumes, records the evolution of the cultural system; the family 30 volumes, record Since the Spring and Autumn Period, the princes and history; the column of 70 volumes, record the life of a variety of characters, the last one is the mother of Tai Shu, and describes the origin of \"Historical Record\". This history of history is known as \"bobbin\". [11]\n\nIn \"Historical Record\", the biography is the most exciting part of the book, describing the object by military home, politician, scholar, to the rich, ride, funny home, etc., involving people from all walks of life. Sima emphasized the historical abstraction and the history of the history. It also noticed the psychological portrait and personalization of the characters, and the character can be drawn to the character, showing his height expression skills.\n\nAlthough \"Historical Records\" is a historical work, it is often appreciated its literary value, Lu Xun once evaluated it as \"the sings of history\" [12]. \"Historical Record\" is a quite impact on the character in the biography, and Feng Menglong's \"East Weekly\" and the legendary of the Ming and Qing Dynasties are directly taken directly in \"History\".\n\nDuring the Eastern Han Dynasty, Class Guarded another bobody work - \"Han Shu\". [13] Compared with the \"Historical Record\" in the nature of the history, \"Han Shu\" only wrote the history of the history of the Western Han Dynasty. The history of Ban Gu was laid the foundation for the righteous history of the future history series. The book in the book is more meticulous, and the shadow of Han Fu can also be seen during the line.\n\nOne of the representative literature in the Han Dynasty was \"assigned\". This kind of literary body is affected by the influence of the Warring States Period. Liu Wei explained this in \"Wen Xinjun Dragon,\" Merry \": [14]\n\nIn other words, it is to draw the objects to be expressed in many different priests. This style is popular in the palace literati in the Han Dynasty. The author of the \"\u9d69 \u9d69\" Jiayi Kai Yiki opened its end, after which the \"seven-year\" is written, the development of the future has a huge impact. To the world of Han Dynasty, the court literati Sima Xiangru wrote a lot of famous works, and the cultivat of Han Duo is complete.\n\nSima Xiang was a famous resignation known as the world, in which the \"Zi Yu\" (\"Wen Choi\" (\"Wen Choi\", \"Yumin\" is the most famous. The borrowing sub-virtual, Mr. Wu is the discussion of the three people as the core of the whole article. At the beginning of the work, Mr. Zuyu, who was born in Chu, carefully, and then, Wu, who had born in Qi, also describes Qi State, and refuting the bustling of Chu State. Finally, I have been silently listening to the death of the two, and the grand scene of Shanglin Yuan and Han Dynasty is a lot of hunting. It is not able to compare the bustling of the Han Dynasty, so that the two people No words can be said.\n\nIn addition, since the \"seven-year\" since the multiply, he has completed the debate of two three characters, plus gorgeous rhetorical skills, forming a stunning arrangement. This kind of rich literary literature can also be seen inherited the characteristics of the \"Zhuangzi\", \"Han Ai\", etc. in the Warring States Period.\n\nSima Xiangru's \"Zi Yu\", the same use of high rhetorical skills to engraise the luxurious grand occasions stated in the three people, and die is the upper pressure shaft of Shanglinyuan. Dead is the river that flows through Shanglinyuan, the fish and birds in the river, the towering mountains, the stream, and scattered the palace in the alleged place, and the trees of the courtyard are described, Show out the vast space of Linyuan. The following part is that Sima Xiangru is borrowing is a male mouth to draw the fish of the river of Linyuan, the waterstock of the waterstock and the flora.\n\nSima Xiangru put many more detailed parts of Shanglin Court as a martial art, presented the panoramic view of the Emperor Court Linyuan's Richtures, readers like immersive.\n\nIt is worth noting that is the principle of writing, and the building space, urban space, etc. of the courtyard palace is to describe the most effective writing skills of the building space, urban space, etc. It is that Sima Xiang is like to play this expression skill to the extreme, and there is no one in the same type of work.\n\n\"Shang Lin Fu\" wrote out of the Queens of Shanglinyuan, in the end, in the end, it is not excessive to the excessive luxury bouting of the court. The traditional views believe that it should be ignorant while showing Richtles, and the so-called \"persuading hundreds of irony\", but this is just the view. In fact, in this work, Sima Xiang is just the responsibility of the court literati, and gives Wu Emperor. Sima Xiangru depicts the wide range of space ruled by Wu Emperor, and it is unparalleled by the power of the property.\n\nAfter Sima Xiangru, Wang Yuli, Yang Xiong is also a famous western resignation in the Western Han Dynasty, but the proportion of works, the rhetoric skills are still not as good as Sima Xiangru.\n\nIt is integrated in the Western Han Dynasty, and the Eastern Han is one of the main literary categories, and similar works are a lot. For example, at the time, Changan and Luoyang, the first-class resignation, and Zhang Heng wrote \"two-section\" and \"second Beijing Fu\". Although the literary achievements of these two works are not inferior to the long paragraph of the Western Han, their techniques are always imitation Sima Xiang, so their work is lost to no personality and tablet. Therefore, in order to break through the pattern of imitation, the two also tried to change the description of the object, write some kind of ideological and inner work, such as the \"Shui Fu\" and Zhang Heng 's \"Sichuan\".\n\nSince then, the theme and ideological content began to change until the end of the six dynasties, a large number of best articles have emerged, and Zhang Heng will evolve the song of songs into small product \"lyrics\". That is to say, with natural little scenes, sorrow is the theme, and use the height rhetoric skills to construct a beautiful world. The style has changed greatly. To the West Jin, Zuo Si wrote \"Sanbu Fu\", the same type of works like the long-term narrative of the Han Dynasty have also been continuously emerged, but the Han Dynasty, the \"Zhaoming Wen Dynasty\" included in the South Dynasty is some lyrics.\n\nFrom this point of view, it is not an orthodox narrative, but this featured to the Eastern Han gradually lose their vitality. This development is never accidental. The Western Han Dynasty, is good at paving the vast space with arguments, and uses vibrant expressions, which is matched with the values \u200b\u200bof writers who have born in the era of prosperity. However, with the event of the times, to the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty, the social turmoil, the values \u200b\u200bof writers changed, and they have always written in a good faith to describe the social reality and people's ideological feelings.\n\nThe end of the Eastern Han Dynasty, the world was chaotic, and the group got. In the year of Jian'an, the war was continuously yearned. In the end, China roughly split into three countries in Wei Shu, officially entered the three era. [15] At the time, the focus of China's economic culture was still concentrated in Cao Wei's Central Plains. Cao Cao's employment is only, and it is a time. At the literary world, the Jian'an seven son is represented by: Kong Yong, Chen Lin, Wang Wei, Xu Gan, Yan Wei, Yingyi and Liu Wei. Cao Cao, Cao Zhi, Cao Yu Sanfu Son itself is also more than written, and they work together with Jian'an Qi Sizi, have created a lot of literary works with real emotions and reflecting reality, and the style is generous and cold, and the world is called \"Jianan Feng Bone\".\n\nThe work of Jian'an poet inherits the topic of the Han Dynasty and the theme and spirit of Yuefu, and the form of literature was also transformed from folk songs, and the performance skills also improved. Their works can be roughly divided into Yuefu works along the Han Dynasty story and some point to specify specific objects, including private gift poems in their own. In these gift poles, there is a difference in ordinary emotions with the previous five-language ancient poems. The poetry in this period is relatively distinct, rich in emotion, and is represented by Cao Zhi.\n\nAfter Cao Zhi, after the failure of Cao Yu, the second half has been depressed, and his five words will also reflect the sad anger of his unhane. His works are rich, such as some of the gifts of poems, \"Gifts, Horse,\" is a representative. In addition, there are also some songs, and assignment, such as \"Luo Shen Fu\". Cao Zhi's five words have greatly expanded the theme of the five words.\n\nTo the Wei and Jin Dynasties, Ruan Ji, who influenced the impact of Taoism, brought the five-poo subjects into a new field. At the end of the Three Kingdoms, the power of Wei Guo's rulers gradually fell to the hands of Sima's father and son, and Sima's father and son also used a different conspiracy to give the emperor, killing loyalty. In this political darkness, Ruan Ji wrote 82, expressing his complex flexible emotions and secretly reflected the actual works from the multi-angle. Through the central idea of \u200b\u200ba series of works, reflecting the poet to disgusting the desire to drive, the red teenager will always be aging, over time, what is the feeling of despair, and the thoughts of the world. This series of works surround this kind of tired thinking, adding some forms of integration above, with the principle, and \"the nineteen of the ancient poem\" is just a bitter caused by an incompetent sense.\n\nStepping into the West Jin, the aristocratic class in the society is basically fixed, poetry is also biased towards the life of the nobles, and the representative of the representative of this period has Pan Yue and Lu [16].\n\nTheir works pay attention to the beauty and rhetoric skills, except for some nobles to sing poetry, there are also some good poems from the inner thoughts. From the perspective of the rheology of Wu Yan, Pan Yue's \"Death Poem\" has an important position. The good written the \"Mourning Poem\" written by the wife's death, and the \"mourning poem\" written down by his wife is full of a high rhetorical skill. The work of the five poetry is until Pan Yue's \"Death Shi\" manifestation is achieved. At the same time, land machine attaches great importance to rhetoric, pay attention to the opponents, and uses the style of unique poems. The landline is a multi-type writer. In addition to the five poems, there are different types of literary works, of which his \"Wen Da\" explored the problems encountered in many literary creations. The poets in the West Jin Dynasty compared to the theme of poetry, they pay more attention to the expression skills of poetry.\n\nSince the \"Nineteen of the ancient poem\", the five poems have been mainly based on the grief style, step into the Eastern Jin, and the style is gradually changed. However, because foreign violations, the Jin Room Nanyu, established the Eastern Jin Politics. At that time, many aristocrats were addicted to the Buddha's thoughts, advocating tags, and the \"Xuan Po\" \"Xuan Xi\" in Fulong Teaching Fairy was prevalent, and the representative was \"14 of\" You Shi Shi \". This type of work topics mainly reflect the poet to leave the world, the fairy world, which is not in the mountains, add some natural scenery. With the prevalence of \"Xuan Yan Poetry\", poetry began to deviate from an intricate real world, and it is naturally subject to beautiful mountains. The subject of the South Dynasty and poems has also begun to transform from Laozhuang thinking to landscape, and the LIU Song's landscape poet Xie Lingyun is representative.\n\nIn East Jin, Tao Solitae has created many poetry. Compared with Xie Lingyun, the landscape poems describing the landscape landscape, Tao Sanks have used some kind of elegant text to sing my own love, and I feel disgusted to the officialdom and the public world. This type of theme and the five words Sorrow is completely different. His literary achievements have not been taken at the time, and they have been officially affirmed by the Song Dynasty. The Qi Liang Chen Dynasty in the South Dynasty was a short-lived dynasty, and poetry also re-turned to describe the noble life. There is a \"palace poem\" and a \"love poem\" describing the woman in a particular object, with a strong decadent tendency.\n\nWith the development of this tendency, the South Dynasty poet is getting more and more talking about expression skills, and it has also begun to pay attention to the rhythm of poetry. Liang Dynasty sinks to comply with this trend, starting to study the sound line, and summarizes the tone of the language into a flat, upper, go, into the four sounds, and puts out the poem to make a balance with the tone. The development of the five words stepped into the final stage in this period, and then could gradually catalyze into the proximity form of the Tang Dynasty. However, because the poets of the South Dynasties pay attention to poetry, the ideological content of poetry is ignored, it is a problem that poems fall into content, and diseaseless. Shen Yao sighed no poet's balance between the poets in the past two hundred years, except Xie Wei. Xie Wei's poems, in depicting the natural scenery, also has personal thoughts and feelings, and this fresh poetry is highly respected by the poet of the Tang Dynasty in the future.\n\nDuring the Wei and Jin Dynasties, the short story was also prevailed. Since the social turmoil is turmoil, the people live in a chaos, many people have lost interest in the world, and they pay attention to strange things, and the \"symbolic novels\" is the product of this era. Although this type of novel is a strange thing, it is not completely fictional. The representative made Dongjin historian peak \"search god\". In addition, since the Buddhism is prevalent, there are also works with Taoism-Taoist immortals, such as Ge Hong's \"Shenxian Biography\", although there is different novels, but in the same theme of the concentration, the theme of the fairy. During this period, the other theme is to include the \"Zhigui Novel\" in the history of famous famous people, and representatives, representatives, Liu Yiqing, edited \"World\". \" Its content narrates the name of the Eastern Han Dynasty to the end of the Eastern Jin Dynasty, a total of 1030 stories, divided into 36 comments. Its thoughts surround the atmosphere of the remarks, and also describe the unique life of the nobles. Like the novels of the novel, you can also see works that do not face the turmoil. Although the novel is simple and short, the structure is not necessarily complete, but it provides a lot of theme for future generations.\n\nBefore Wei Jin, although China did not have a literary commentary, in some literature, some people also revealed some opinions on some literary works. For example, in \"Zuo Zhuan\" \"Analects\", many times will refer to the \"Book of Songs\" to express their opinions, although only some of the words only have the word, but it also reflects the readers' opinion and opinions. In the era of Warring States, some people began to explain this kind of objection to this kind of explanation, such as \"Mencius\", \"said the poet, not in the words, not resignation. Initialism, it is If the words of \"Yunhan\" are said, \"Yunhan\" poem: 'Zhou Yu Ri people, \u9761 \u9057?' Sinus also, it is a week without any remains. \"He believes that if only one word is only a word, I can't master the meaning of the author's whole work. In other words, I understand the author's heart is very important. To the two Han, \"Mao Shi\" and the \"Sep Sea\", \"Lai Zai\", \"Lai Zai\", and criticized the \"Poetry\" and \"Dai Sao\" from Confucianism. For example, for example, some love poems of the \"Book of Songs\" are the teaching poems of the songs of the song, the latter focuses on Qu Yuan's life rather than the work. To the later Wang Yi in its \"Chu Zhu Yan\", try to overthrow the advice, extracted from the value judgment, and directly on the work.\n\nSince then, until the Times, the status of literature gradually come out from other academic classifications, and literature began to re-recognize in literature. During this period, Wei Wenmi Cao Yu's \"Patient Paper\" is an article specializing in literature. He mentioned in the article: \"Cover the article, the country, the big industry, the immortal event\". The \"article\" here is not limited to the narrow literature of poetry, including today's documents, philosophical articles, and more. In this article, Cao Yu did not alone in ancient literature, and commented on the members and their works of Jianan Literature. For example: [17]\n\nAlthough the King of Jian'an Qi Zi is good at resignation, other literary categories are more than Zhang Heng, Cai Yuxue color. This is because each author has its own personality, so it is good at literary types that are not good at. There are different practices in different literary types (play, discussion, book, theory, Ming, \u8bd4, poetry, and foncing). \"Those who can be partially;\" only to prepare their body \", people who will write articles also Have a preference, only a talented person can also make various stories. It is very difficult to say that it is very difficult to completely good at all literary works. In the mastery of the style, he also proposed the congenital \"gas\" concept: \"Wen is the mainstay of gas, the turbidity of the gas is not strong ... Although in the father, you can't take the brother.\" Literary creation It is basically dependent on \"talent\", which is the qualifications that the author congenitally given, is not to reach the day after tomorrow. This type of hen, even if the biological child is impossible to inherit.\n\nAfter the \"Patient Paper\" was launched for more than 100 years, the West Xinluo machine has also written a \"Wen Da\" one, and is one of the representatives of the Wei Jin Dynasties literary comments. This article is written in an excipient, and the content of the literary theory and comments are not written, not to comment on specific writers or works. The text is based on the principle of creative, from the past and the literary theory of literature and their own works and their own works. As in the order: \"The balances are made to have their own intentions ... so they have a literary, with the creation of the ceremony, the interest of the composition.\"\n\n\"Wen Da\" will write:\n\nThat is to say, standing around the center of the Universe, absorbing nutrients in ancient books, after mastering all things on space and time, the author will naturally be changed by the season (time) and the natural parts of the world ( Space) Stimulating, the purpose of writing will come to life.\n\nIn addition, land-machine has different standals to measure different stories in many literary institutions. It is exactly \"having a body, no one thing.\" This article analyzes the poems, bonus, monuments, \u8bd4, Ming,, \u9882, theory, play, and say ten kinds. Compared with the \"Patient Paper\", the cultural body proposed by \"Wen Da\" has repeatedly added, and the discussion is also more detailed, but the biggest distribution is the prose of the official nature \"\" discussion \"in poetry Previously, after the latter put this type of style in seven rhymes, this is impressing that the style of direct expression of personal feelings has gradually become the center of literature, and is close to the concept of now. The reason why this article can discuss numerous literary gehe, in addition to the land machine itself is a writer who is good at different literary genre, it is also related to the diversification of the literary world.\n\nAnother feature of \"Talent\" is to analyze the psychological analysis of writers. Although this article did not comment on a specific writer or work, land machine summarizes some literature theory after reading many ancient literary works, and then cooperate with their own creation experience, showing what writer is writing in creation, do not write What and its creation process. For example, in the text:\n\nThis is discussed to the work of the writer who is lacking in the originality and the same as the previous work. If you have created, you have to cut love, this is vividly drawing out the predecessors and their own creations.\n\nIn addition, the regret after the completion of the work is not able to pay attention to what you want (and the six-style bayness, emissory gods), etc. when the work is completed. Distressed, land machine also proposed objective analysis of this type of problem. This style of literary commentary, and after the \"Wen Xinji Dragon\", it reaches the extent of flowering results.\n\nIn the 5th century, the poet Yan Yan, Xie Lingyun and others also published some writings of literary comments, and Jiang Yan and Xie Lingyun were more reflected in their own literary works in their \"simulated poem\", literature. Comments commented in the north and south towns The more prosperous. If the most important thing is the highest, you must not mention the \"Wen Xin Dynasty\" and Zhong Rong 's \"Poetry\".\n\nMore than 50 \"Wen Xin Dynasty\" is a systematic strict literary review of unprecedented cases in the history of Chinese literature. The authors analyze a variety of literary genre and problems from different perspectives. 50 of the books can be divided into two parts, the first half of the first five is the principle of narrative literature. After 20 articles, the literary physiology is divided into 33 categories for detailed analysis, supplemented with the example of this type of work, The origin, characteristics and appearance of class literary genre. 25 second half, the last one as the order \"preface\" article, mainly involving various issues of literature and writers, such as rhetoric, sound, metaphor, individuality, etc. Although the author has a deep Confucian classic foundation, he also believes that there is a place in the literary creation in the literary creation, this is also the total of \"Wen Xinji Dragon\" in the literary creation. A feature among the fitness.\n\nThe view of Liu Wei's previous humanities work is visible everywhere in the \"Wen Xinji Dragon\". For example, to discuss the \"distraction\" article of the public, he issued a discussion on the content of the reviewers from the past generation (\"\u4efb \u4efb,,,, \"), It is believed that it should be investigated according to the content of the written content (\" will review the words \"). Along this idea, Liu Wei returns to the characteristics of the song: \"The same is true\", \"The Body\", \"The Biye Water\", \"The Rise\", \"The Words of Bours\") and \"\"\u5f02 \u7ecf \u7ecf \"(\" Signs \",\" Dramatic Talk \",\" Sorrow \",\" Was Sword \"). Although the latter has insufficient places, but overall looks also have high literary and artistic, and analyzes should be calibromally and aggravate.\n\nAccording to Liu Wei, from the specific literary works, he also discussed the difficulties of the works in \"Zone\", which can also be seen as the methodology in Liu Wei's literary comment. The reason why the reader is not able to correctly understand the work is because \"Gui Zi\", \"Chonghe Ace]\" and \"Samoufa\". That is to say, all ancient works think is good works, despise today's work; low standards, but the standards for others are high; they have not known but believe in some ridiculous discussions. In addition, he also puts forward that \"the husband chapter is surrounded, the text is handed, knowing more, people are not round ... will be filled with self, I feel free to abandon\", \"It is said that there are many kinds of literary works and readers. Different views, because everyone's interest is different, the understanding of the work is different, so this comment cannot be neutrophily.\n\nSo how do you understand the literary work correctly? First of all, the reader must read a lot of literary works in a large number, so that it can be \"selfless than the heavy weight, not to bother, then can reason,\" like a mirror. \"\n\nRegarding the specific literary analysis and comment method, Liu Wei proposed to observe from the following six perspectives: \"Body\" (literary genre), \"resignation\" (wording), \"Traditional inheritance and creation),\" odd \"(Orthodoxical and heterogeneous adjustment),\" mature \"(use of allusions),\" palace \"(rhythm). However, in this this, only \"communication\", \"strange\" and \"incident\" are slightly involved in the content, and others just touch the basic expression techniques of literary works. However, Liu Wei believes that the correct understanding of literary works is not a single one from the perspective of expression skills. He also wrote: \"The husband is sentimental, and the vintage is in love,\" due to literature The work is reflected in the text through expressive skills, and readers must in turn to examine the author's thoughts and feelings.\n\nIn addition to the above six angles, Liu Wei also has other chapters, such as \"Listening\", \"Exaggeration\", \"Class\", \"Sound\", etc., etc., the discussion of different literature issues. \"Wen Xin Dynasty\" book discusses both basic literary theory, and also talks about the problem encountered in literary creation, and even how readers should understand the problem of literary works.\n\nCompared with the various literary issues of \"Wen Xinjun Dragon\" in the same time, Zhong Rong's \"Poetry\" focuses on poetry, especially the five-language poetry. The book divided from the 123 poets of the Han Dynasty to the Liang Dynasty into \"super goods\", \"China\", \"following\" a total of nine levels, and discussed, its grade system and the \"nine products\" in the court of the court \" Class, while other art categories such as Sheikh \"Ancient\", \"Book\" and Liang Wu Emperor \"Go Products\" also use the hierarchical system, and you can see \"Poetry\" to a certain level It is affected by this atmosphere.\n\nA large feature of \"Poetry\" is to divide the many poets into the poetry, and the source stream is mainly divided into two major camps of the \"Book of Songs\" and \"Chu\". Machine, Xie Lingyun, etc., the latter includes Cao Yu, Wang Wei, Pan Yue, Zhang Zhilong. The poet of the Book of Song is mainly in front of the West Jin, and the church is the Western Jin. According to Zhong Rong's view, he is more affirmative of the poet's poet's poet, which is also related to Zhong Rong's abortion.\n\nIn many poets, Zhong Rong gave Cao Zhi very high evaluation: \"The bones are high, the words, the emperors, the emperor, the body is cultural, and the body is in the ancient, Zall.\" Zhong Rong Xi Chong Cao Zhi is the inner work. Tough ideological feelings and external gorgeous words, these two aspects can also be seen as the standard of Zhong Rong product. With the same angle, he believes that Liu Wei \"True Bone Cream, the high wind, the high wind,\" there is a small number of words, the carving hate is less. However, the following is the following, \"Wang Wei,\" Duxiu, \" ...... Fang Chen Si, more than Wei Wen. \"Liu Yu Chang was\" bone \"but lack\" word \", Wang Wei has\" word \"but lacks\" bone \", so that its status is in Cao Zhi. Throughout the view of Zhong Rong, he gave a review of the poet of the poetry, \"\", \"qi\", etc., and believes that there is strong and powerful ideological emotion in the work.\n\nTang poetry is a poem that created in the Tang Dynasty (618 - 907), or it can be used to refer to poems created by the Tang Dynasty style. The Tang Dynasty was regarded as the highest golden period in China's history, so there is Tang poetry, and the Song Words will be held. After the Tang Dynasty, Tang poetry's option was emerging. Nowadays, the most widely circulated is the \"three hundred\" Tang Poetry \"edited by Dangtang. The \"All Tang Poem\" in the Qing Dynasty in the Qing Dynasty included more than 50,000 poets more than 50,000 poems. The second half of the Tang Dynasty, the economy is rich, the literati is coming from the Baiguan tour, and the \u4f20 \u4f20 \u98ce \u98ce \u98ce \u6c14After the talents of the treasure, they will follow the disaster of the town, the life is moving, and the love of the depths is available to use poetry.\n\nRegardless of the theme, genre, or style, Tang poet has a major impact on the creation of the poems of future generations. After Tang, some people still have the format of ancient poems and recent poems. In the literature of future generations, Tang poetry is often quoted as an allusion. Tang poetry and the mutual influence of calligraphy, art and music are also closely related to Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism, providing important information on the language, history, religion and culture at the time. In the Tang Dynasty, poetry is a project of the imperial examination. In addition, Tang poetry has become an important culture of China, whether it is a literati or a general civilians, will be exposed. In addition to the influence of China's literature and art, the Tang Dynasty also affected Japan, South Korea's poems. In the 19th century, many Tang poetry were also translated into European languages.\n\nIn the early Tang Dynasty, although the Poetry of the Tang Dynasty did not have a beautiful poetry, in this period, it was called Wang Bo, Yang Lan, Lu Zhao, Luo Bin and Chen Zi'an, opened up the theme of poetry and meteorological, poetry content. It is not a feeling of being in a hurry. In the poetry genre, this period gradually established a contractual contrast, such as Wang Bo's \"Tengwang\" final poem:\n\nTeng Wang Guofeng Linjiang, Pei Yuming, Song and Dance.\nThe painting darnilla is in the Jinanpu clouds, and the curtain is rolling.\nThe leisure pool is long, and the thing is shifted for a few autumn.\n\nAlthough it is not working hard, it is also possible to see the prototype of the poetry.\n\nIn the Sheng Tang period, the poems, in the form of, in terms of form: five words, seven words sentence, five-language poetry and seven-language poems. As far as the subject matter, this period has become diversified than the Tang Dynasty, which can be summarized as wishes, pastoral, landscape, romantic, realism, etc.\n\nIn front of the wanderer, the ginseng, high-quality represented, their seven-language ancient poems and Yuefu are the most popular, such as the high-quality \"Yan Song\", the weather is magnificent in the poem, but also describes the long-term service of the exclusions and can't return home. Distressed, the hard work of military service, the complaint of the corruption in the upper one. In addition, Wang Changling is more than seven, which can draw the process of the war with a short-descent condemn, and is called \"Poetry Tianzi\"; in addition, his nephew is very famous, describing a woman's one fell very well. The representative has \"from the military\" \"plug\" and \"\u95f0\" and so on.\n\nThe idyllic style is representative of Meng Haoran, and the content is mainly written by idyllic life, leisurely, but there are some poetry. For example, there is \"Ying Ting's Zhang Yizhen\" has a \"desire without boat, end shame,\", expressing the distress of his stories.\n\nThe representatives of landscape poetry are Wang Wei. The characteristics of his work is to describe the quiet natural environment, natural scenery, and see his poem is like appreciating a landscape painting, such as \"deer\" and \"Zhu Ri House\", so Song Suzhen said His work is \"painting in poetry, poems in painting.\" In addition, his work is sometimes penetrating some Buddha while writing, so he is also known as \"Poetry\". Although his work is biased toward the landscape, he also made a strong sense of success in his young period, which is also reflected in his early works, such as \"old line\".\n\nIf you mention romantic poetry, \"Poetry\" Li Bai is his representative. [18] His characteristic is to express his thoughts with a relatively simple word, such as the famous \"quiet night\", so Du Fu called his work \"Qingshui out of hibiscus, natural to carvings\". His work is mainly concentrated in poetry, ancient poems and Yuefu, and pay less attention to the rhythm. It is some silence, and he does not necessarily be created according to the fixed partner, but it is very musical, which is also in line with his non-choice. He has a lot of famous works, except for the \"quiet nights\" mentioned before, there are also some kinds of enthusiasm, such as \"I will enter the wine\", \"Xuanzhou Xie Yunlou, the book\", etc., there are some penetration Taoism Touring fairy thoughts, such as \"Dream Tour Day],\" Moon Danger, \" Song \"and so on, the content is colorful. [19]\n\nThe representative of realism is \"Shi Sheng\" Du Fu. Du Fu's works have a handline, longer than refining, and genre from an ancient ancient wind to seven law. Du Fu worries the people, this kind of sadness is reflected in many of his works, such as \"Spring\", expressing the grief of \"National Breakfast\"; \"Dengtun\", it is to see a grass One wood, I will feel \"spending near the high floor hurt the customer, the Wanfang is more difficult to see\"; there are many works. Because of the war, I will think of my family, such as \"Moonlight Millennium\", \"Jiang Village\"; satiric is heavy, such as \"soldier car\"; sarcasm, corrupt life, such as \"Li people\"; there are some borrows The past history or the monument expresses his feelings, such as \"Huahui Mission\", respectively describe the historical figures of Wu Xin, Song Yu, Wang Zhaojun, Zhuge Liang and Liu Bei; \"eight pictures\", borrowed the ruins of Glasses To satirize the time. Since his poetry can record the people's livelihood in the time, reflect the true reality, the world is also called \"poetry\".\n\nAnd to the Chinese Tang, although social turmoil, the famous poet has a lot. For example, the Han Yu, who launched ancient sports, he tried to use the text as a poem, and the style is innocent. At this time, there are some poets known for the landscape of the mountains, such as Liu Zongyuan, Wei Ying, representing the works, \"Jiang Xue\" and \"Zhangzhou Xi'an\", etc. Also, Yuan Yizhen, Bai Juyi two people launched a new Lefu in the poetry, and advocated that \"the article is in the same time, the song poetry is in a matter\", reflecting the realism of the society, and the words are simple and simple. The former's self-prophet's \"sent a sorrow\" emotion is sincere, the latter \"New Yuefu\" inherited the tradition of the reality since Han Lefu, and satirized. Bai Juyi also wrote a number of famous ancient poems, such as \"long hatege\", describing the love story of Tang Xuanzong and Yang Guifei; \"\u7435\u7436\", borrow a song of self-injury. There are also different works during this period, such as Daxi Talent, they pay attention to the reticle, the poetry is natural.\n\nDuring the late Tang Dynasty, the poetry was in a weak center, and the representative of the characters had Li He. He inherited Han Yu's odd-story, so the world called him \"poem\". [20] Later Du Mu, Li Shangyin, Advanced Large Alcohol, Trivinality, Content Take Personal Help, Love, etc., compare Sheng Tang, Zhong Tang theme is poor. Du Mu wrote a lot of romance, Li Shangyin is longer than seven, his acorpted poetry has a certain position in the history of literature, but also further pushing the poetry at the time to the exhaustion of the slut, until the Popular Sinnaka The body is also the poetry of the Shangrong.\n\nThe extension field can get new development and start with the form of new expression. This is the case with Han Yu, the \"Ancient Wen\" advocated by Liu Zongyuan. Six times, with four-character, six-character sentences, the sound, the sound of the stacking literature, and the \u9a88\u6587 \u6587 \u9a88 is the mainstream at the time. \"\u9a88 \u6587\" or \"four or six\" These names have not yet appeared before the ancient art. In order to confront the text, Han Yu and others, in order to confront the text, the Confucian concept of the previous ancient freedom of ancient freedom and the sixth Dynasties.\n\nThe ancient language has abolished many of the rules of the text, but also emphasized the Confucian value of the decline in the Six Dynasties, which is a negative attitude towards the south. For example, Han Yu, who is often quoted: \"The book of non-three generations is not visible\" (\"Answer Li Wei\"), it can be seen in the middle. However, as Sheng Tang poetry is born from inheritance and opposition to the southern literature, the ancient text also absorbed the mature expression technique in the formation process. Ancient text is not only resended in the past, and is also a new literary genre formed by the needs of the times.\n\nAbout Han Yu in the history of literature, Japanese Jichuan Hairo has the following opinion:\n\nIt can be seen from here that in the history of literature, or with Han Yu as an opportunity, Chinese literature is transformed from the era of poetry to the era of prose. The language of poetry is less and refined, like ancient times; prose writes in a wide variety of languages, like modern times. There is also that the refining of poetry is to be intuitive thinking. The writing of the prose is more powerful to analyze the thinking, the intuitiveness is the ancient people, analyzing is the things of modern people.\n\nAlthough Han Yong and Liu Zongyuan, the ancient essays have spawned to the results of Han Liu's excellent work, but it still does not change the trend of the mainstream of the American (46 \"), even if they enter the Song University, Still known as \"Times\", prevailing for a while.\n\nThe legend is a short story of the Tang Dynasty, inheriting a literary genre with the development of the six novels. In this period, although it also followed the theme of the north and south chair, the content began to bias from the real material, there were some \"talented\" works that did not \"strange\", [21 For example, \"Yushu\" and \"Li Wazhen\"; and some hero novels, such as \"\u866c\u9aef \u866c\u9aef \u4f20\", hopping the people's expectations in the Chinese Tang Ducheng. From this point of view, the legend of the Tang Dynasty can be regarded as the pioneer of the Chinese venerary literature. In addition to the previous mention, there is also \"Du Zichun\" (short story for the Japanese Mustang Dragon \",\" Du Zichun \"originally),\" Huijiang Bai Bai Biography \"\" Tour Xiu Shu \"\" Pillow \"\" Nan Ke Taishou \"\", \"And so on. \"The\" Tour Xueuang \"once scattered, but reserved in Japan.\n\nThe Song Dynasty began, and the development of poetry was mainly divided into two parts: temple and the poet of the grass. The temple poet is not necessarily powerful in the officialdom, but at least there is official position. Song Ji Poetry Altar is basically in the temple as the center, the poetry is inherited late Tang Yuri's poem. At that time, the knowledge-based Yhan Hanlin Yang Yi took himself and his poetry, the poems of Qian Weng and others were published as \"West Qoon Remarks\". Since then, their poetry is called \"Xunban\", but they are not a poem because of the special creative concept. To the truth, it is still very prevalent.\n\nTheir poems almost completely imitate the late Tang's poem, even if it is also imitated, but it is more simple to take out the old things, and the creation is relatively simple. The Tang Dynasty is not a poet during the Five-generation period during the establishment of the Song Dynasty. However, due to the short-term turmoil, there is no poet worth mentioning in the history of poetry, so the Song Dynasty poetry is directly inherited the late Tang Dynasty. Instead of inheriting, inertia may be more appropriate. However, Xichen Poet did not intend to create inert. They found the beauty of Tang Poetry in accordance with their own pace, and they inherited the development. Therefore, they most advocated the poems of Li Shangyin, Li Shangyin's poetry is to express the dull desperation of the late Due to the middle of the people in the late Tang Dynasty. However, the West Kunfai poet did not have any desperation. They chose to inherit the gorgeous performance skills, which can see the political tools of the Power of the founding of the founding of the founding.\n\nHowever, in the same period, a new poetry has gradually formed. For example, Wang Yizhen has created a poetry of a simple natural body. He itself is a senior official, but there is no influence of the deacon. He excluded the poetry of the Tang Dynasty, in the Tang Dynasty, in the Tang Dynasty, such as the Li Butu Du Fu and the Tang Dynasty during the Tang Dynasty. He did not follow the popular poetry, but with his own judgment, he selected excellent poet and took and inherited their poem.\n\nInheriting this source of the source is Mei Yichen and Su Shiqin. The two are in the officialdom, and the awareness is close to the grass poet. Therefore, their poetry does not have a purple and peace of mind, more is to express their true bitterness and pleasure. From this attitude, Song poetry inherited Tang poetry, and the feeling of poets in the new era and opened its own poetry.\n\nAnd the poems of Renzong Dynasty and Ouyang Xiu are deeply influenced by Mei Mei, inheriting and developing the style of these two people. Ouyang Xiu is both a poet, an excellent essay family, scholar and talented bureaucrat. Since he talented, he gradually became popular in the officialdom, there was a certain position in the temple. At this moment, the poems of the temple change. The grass in the early Song Dynasty was brought into the temple through his hand, and the poems of West Kun since the Tang Dynasty. Since then, the poems of the nobility and pay attention to the characteristics of the gorgeous feature gradually quit the mainstream, and the foundation of Song poetic features and political characteristics. Ouyang Xiu, a proud of the officialdom, is unusual, but the predecessor is lifted for life in the poetry, and has a good old generation. Among the people who were appreciated by him, there were only the opposition of the opposition, and there was also the mountains who were in the mountains in the mountains, the unnamed Sui and their sons Su Shi, Su Shi.\n\nTo Shen Zong, Wang Anshi became the prime minister and vigorously promoted the new law. At that time, even the poetry, he also had a powerful influence and wrote a lot of politics. He is most advocating Du Fu, and evaluates Du Fu is a great poet, which is established by his influence. In this way, the poetry of the temple in the Song Dynasty himself also realized the tendency of the Tang Dynasty. Since Wang Anshi is opposed to the political situation, Su Shi has been frustrated in the officialdom. Despite this, he and the door around him, known as the Fourth Bachelor of Summer, Huang Tingjian, \u6641 \u6641, Zhang Wei, Qin Guan and others basically have this tendency. After the new party, the old party retreated. Although the new and old party fights, the temple is still developing this trend. Su Shi is different from Wang Anshi. He is not just to promote Du Fu, but regard Du Fu as one of the great poets. After that, Huang Tingjian in this view is better than Su Shi more pushing Du Fu. The opposition of the political situation did not be brought into the poetry, but in turn, between Wang Anshi and Su Shi, there was a common place in poetry creation.\n\nSu Shi has left a witty outstanding work, which has a huge impact on the development of the poetry of future generations. He has a lot of political ironic poetry, with \"lycheon sigh\" is the most famous. In addition, he also wrote a lot of rich poetry, such as \"Wang Yushan Waterfall\", \"and the child is nostalgic\" and so on. There are many excellent poets under Su Shi, especially Huang Tingjian, he can compete with Su Shi, the world is called \"Su Huang\". Huang Tingjian put forward \"rebellion\" and \"ignition alloy\" in poetry creation, and the great interest in the ideological content of the ancient poems into his poems and show people. In addition, in the rhythm of poetry, he inherited Han Yu, trying to be a rhyme, rhyme, known as \"\u62d7 \u62d7 poem\".\n\nI wrote the \"Jiangxi Zongpai\" in Lu Ben, the alternating period of the Northern Song Dynasty. According to this class spectrum, the ancestors of the poetry is Du Fu. Huang Tingjian is the most exactly inherited Du Fu's poem. In addition, the 26 poets of Huang Tingjian join the column. Lu Benzhong is the Chinese Southern Southern Song, at any time, but because of the opposition to the Lord and School, the owner is at the time of the mainstream color. Since then, Huang Tingjian is formally established for the \"Jiangxi Poem\" of the ancestor. Although Jiangxi is from Huang Tingjian's origin, his poem is not all Jiangxi people, and Huang Tingjian did not realize that he had to build a poetry, which is the class spectrum prepared by Lu Benzhong and his gone. The poem is established. However, regardless of the establishment of Jiangxi Poetry, when the concept of Jiangxi Poetry is established, a huge influence is played in the early poetry of the Southern Song Dynasty.\n\nJiangxi Poetry highlights Du Fu, and also attaches great importance to the \"Monochondrikan\" advocated by Huang Tingjian. That is to say, when you create poetry, you attacked the predecessor's verse, only modify the small part of the new poetry; or the idea of \u200b\u200bthe former poetry, but expressed in additional techniques. Due to the efforts of Ouyang repair and Wang Anshi, I found out the excellent part of the Tang Dynasty poetry, on the one hand, the poet of the Song Dynasty poeted Tang poetry into a giant pyramid that tower in front of himself. Huang Tingjian advocates an interiter of crossing this pyramid.\n\nHowever, in the end of the Jiangxi Poetry, many poets of this sent poet have borrowed the predecessor's poem to modify one or two words, claimed to be new works, and the work is simple. The famous poet Luo Tour in the early South Song Dynasty, Fan Chengda, Yang Wanli, etc., although the poem started from Jiangxi poetry, but in the end their poetry also left the Jiangxi Poetry.\n\nDuring the turmoil of the Song Dynasty, poetry gradually returned to the characteristics of lyrics. This poem is in the Southern Song Song (Lu You, Fancheng, Yang Wanli, Yusu). Among them, behind it is a poem that patriotic poets write a lot of themes, which is more famous is his poems with patriotic emotions. For example, \"Night Reading Book\", he explained himself \"Ping Miles, Gangang Wang. All the words of the war, the shameless wife, \"\" Golden Right \"in the\" Golden Flat Telle \":\" Singing, Chu, although the three households can die, there is a Chinese air! \", Complaining that the imperial court does not think into progress, there is no determination to recover the Central Plains; for example,\" book anger \":\n\nThe landlift night snowwood shore, the iron horse autumn wind is big.\nThe Great Wall is sent to the Great Wall, and the mirror has been first spotted.\n\nHe expressed the wish of recovering the Central Plains and launched his own old age. It was weak for the Northern Expedition; \"In the autumn night, he will be a fence to cool the door\" \"\" The people of the people tears, the south of the people In one sentence, he is not alone in the unwanted progress of the court, but also thinks of the sadness of the people who are oppressed by the people. By the passage is the \"indication\" of his death:\n\nExpressing the day of life can't see the recess of the Central Plains. In addition to patriotic feelings, there are many famous love works, such as \"Shenyuan\":\n\nExpressing in Tang Yu for many years, I still don't forget. There are also the same works, such as \"Dream Tour Shenyuan\":\n\nIt can be seen that although he is old, it is still missing Tang. As for \"spring tour\":\n\nPeach blossoms are still in terms of people. In addition, there are some idyllic, such as \"You Shanxi Village\" and some political satirous poetry. There are a lot of works in Lu You, and sincere, at that time, his poetry is very angry, called \"Xiao Li Bai\". However, landing is not valued by the poem, such as the name \"Sword Men Road, the rain\":\n\nIt reflects that he is unimped to the country, and it is a shame when a poet is a poet.\n\nSince Fancheng became a prime minister, after the middle of the Southern Song Dynasty, the temple was no longer the center of the poetry. Whether the court is the main battle or the Lord, the poet is no longer interested. In this period, a new batch of grass poets appeared.\n\nFor example, in the early 13th century after Yang Wanli and Lu Jo's death, Zhao Shixiu, Weng Zhu, Xu Zhao, Xu Zhu, four poets in Yongjia (now in Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, known as \"Yongjia Siling\". Singer is praised to have talented beauty on poetry, but there is no name in the officialdom. Although Zhao Shi Xiu and others were in their sorrows, but the official resume was unknown. The reason why they are famous is because they have been appreciative of Ye Shi and his Yongjia School in Yongjia. However, even Yongjia's school is not the official in the officialdom, or when some idle official positions. The reason why they have been taken may be because of the economic policy of the South Song Dynasty, the prosperity of Harbor, Yongjia.\n\nThe same example also has the eastern master of Lin'an Bookstore with Zhao Shi Xiu. Although he is selling ancient books, it also publishes many Tang Poetry. Nature, his bookstore gathered a poet. Chen Qi it also creates a poem. Therefore, he chose the work of the poet who came to his store to repair the \"Jianghu Set\" release. The rivers and lakes are the meaning of relative to the temple. In this poem, a total of 109 people are collected. Although there are poets like Liu Kezhuang to become senior officials, most of them are still the poet of the grass, most of them are the bureaucrats, mountains, including the mountains, and low political status. Little poet. Since then, the name of the \"Jianghu School\" officially appeared, specifically refers to 109 poets in the \"Jianghu Ji\". The development process is the same as Jiangxi, and it is not established at the beginning, and it has been established, and it will naturally call friends. The common point of Yongjia Singer and the Jianghu School is a small number of trivial things around the subject. There is no exhibition of Badal or a warm passion.\n\nSong Shi and Tang poetry, generally, biased towards dull, quiet and reasonable. One aspect is related to the Song Dynasty Social Background, on the one hand, the excellent poet of the Song Dynasty, in front of Tang poetry, the peak of the history of literature, and built its own style.\n\nAt the end of the Southern Song Dynasty, the work worthy of respect is not, but most of the work content lacks the authors from the heart. On the occasion of the death of the Southern Song, the appearance of Wen Tianxiang and Xie Yu, who are famous for the patriotic poetry, and the appearance of people.\n\nThe gold chartered in parallel with the South Song, because it is a constant political power, political and cultural conservative, poetry, the poetry is close to Xun Kun, and the poetry is close to Xun Kun. In addition, there is another famous poet in this period. His poetry creation is Du Fu as an indicator, but this is the promotion of Wang Anshi, not his own claim. Although I didn't deny that I was influenced by Song poetry, he was different from Jiangxi poetry, with another angle to approach Du Fu. He is not confracted to rely on the bones and rebell, not to express the skills, the idea of \u200b\u200bideas, and he focuses on the god of poetry. He was an appreciation of Zhao Bingwen, became a door, which was originally an active active. But until 45, Jin Guo was destroyed by Mongolia, and he wrote a lot of poems that mourned the family, reflected in Du Fu, and the name of poetry was also improved.\n\nBefore the Northern Song Dynasty\n\nNorth Song Division:\n\nSouthern Song Division:\n\nIn Ouyang Xiu \"Old Han Wen\" has the following narratives for the prose from the Song University:\n\nYang Yili, Liu Wei and Qianmeng were all the courts of the Song Dynasty, and they cherished the creation of Tang Li Shang hidden and greeted poems (Xunxun), and became the standard style of participating in the subject. However, the strange \"Thasian\" \"of the four or six \u9a88 \u6587 and the launch of the trend of this trend gradually becoming the need to adapt to the needs of the current social changes. In 1028, Song Renzong had two priests, \"must be realized\". [22] In this case, in the early Song Dynasty, some literati had a negative attitude towards the mainstream of the inventory. In 1011, Yao Wei's \"Tang Wen\", compared to the national cultural undertakings, a total of \"Wenyuan Yinghua\", \"Taiping Guanghua\", \"Taiping Guangji\", \"Taiping\", \"Tang Wen\", \"Tang Wen\", compared to the national cultural undertakings The title is indicated by the name of the work, based on the standard of the editor's own standard. These standards, a look at the works, and only have a civil liberation, and the text is only ancient text. The poem is just ancient poems, the law in the law, the four or six \u9a88 \u6587, the proximal poem is completely not included. Yao Yu is actually a member of the ecstasy of the Song Dynasty. In the Central Tang period, Han Yong, who was headed by Han, and promoted the extension of the form of freedom of the form of a form of freedom. Only the end of the Tang Dynasty, I went to the early days of Song, Liu Kai, Wang Yizhen, Mu Xiu and Yao Wei re-promoted ancient text, and then successfully subaped Ouyang Xiu, Wang Anshi, Wang Anshi, and Su Shi lay in the form of Chinese prose in the future.\n\nOuyang Xiu has exposed to Han Yu in ancient times in a child and affirmed the value of ancient text. He told Yin Wei and Su Shiqin and other like-minded people to conduct prose reform movements. In 1057, Ouyang Xiu served as a Kangjong (Examinant Examiner), abolished the way to evaluate the ability of candidates in the way, and changed to the ancient texts of the role of the repression of the design. In this imperial examination, Su Shi, Su Shi, Zeng Gong, they also became an excellent essay in the literary world, and raised Ouyang Xiu's propose (ancient text) to carry forward, becoming the mainstream of the literary world. This position is not shaken in modern times.\n\nOuyang Xiu's history of history is expressed by the propose-based prose, China's academics also developed further developed by this new literary physiology. However, traditional beauty is not ugly, such as Ouyang Xiu's \"Cyclony, Qiqi\" 7 volumes in the table, system, notak, check, \u6555, \u6555, etc., etc. Also use four or six-text way. As a senior official (Hanlin), you must have this excellent writing ability. Many famous prose is also a US instrument, which is related to the use of different stories in response to the use of the article.\n\nThe representative writers of Tang Guwen and Song have added and become \"Tang Song and Song Dynasty\". This is from Qing Shende Lobo to combine eight people into \"Tang Song Dynasty\" 30 volumes. The Song Dynasty writers of Tang Song Dynasty have Ouyang Xiu, Su Wei, Su Shi, Su Shi, Zeng Gong and Wang Anshi Six people. When Su Shi, Su Shi and Zeng Zen are the Jiayou 3-year ceremonies tried in Ouyang Xiu. By. Su Shi's father and son pointed to \"three sis\", everyone got the enlightenment of Ouyang Xiu's encounter. Even if the change is a well-known Wang Anshi, it will follow Ouyang Xiu in the political view, but his talent is the earliest discovery. Six people across two generations, from the mid-Northern Song Dynasty to late, almost the active writers at the same days, China's neighbors' mainstream stories are also laid, mature at this time. Although the six people can say that it is an Ouyang Xiu, there is a little different in their own articles. In summary, it is a representative of the literary and state of Ouyang Xiu, who learns Han, ancient Chinese.\n\nJichuan Ji Lang compared Han Yu and Ouyang Xiu's essay style:\n\nIn the Tang Dynasty, some drama performances or stories are mainly concentrated in the aristocrats and monastery. At that time, in the noble private, the nobles would ask these people to perform entertainment, but they did not open. In the temple, in order to increase the believers, there will be some \"common telle\" in the speech to non-Buddhists. This part is not related to Buddhism. These two places can be seen as the origin of popular novels, but because they are not open, such performances are not prosperous. And the Song Dynasty, the cockroach of the evening is loose than before, plus the development of industry and commerce, and the nightlife has become lively, and the story, theater performance, etc. also walk into the life of the civilians in the aristocratic and temples, which is close to the development of the novels in the Song Dynasty. Relationship.\n\nIn the Song Dynasty, all the people gathered in the streets of the Kaifeng and the South Song Dynasty in the Northern Song Dynasty, called \"Watts\" at the time. In \"Watt\", there is a \"hook\" a type of performance drama, storytelling. In the Tang Dynasty, this performance is only limited to the aristocrats and monasteries, and now you can act as a commodity in the previse. According to the \"Dudicheng Ji Sheng\", in the \"hook\", there is a \"speech\" talk show, this kind of performance is also divided into 4 categories, \"talking four\". Regarding these 4 categories of projects, the people say that the content is roughly as follows:\n\nIn the four categories described above, the most important part is \"novel\". This name later gradually became a synonym of \"speaking\".\n\nIn that era, due to the prevalence of \"speaking\" and the number of literats, people are not only to go to the \"hook\", and there is also the need to turn this \"performance\" into a text. Turn this demand into business opportunities, it is the development of printing at the time. Prior to this, the publishing of books was mainly written by hand; but with the printing of the Song Dynasty, a large and cheap publication can be published in a short period of time. Since the publication of the Song Dynasty has a conditional development commercial publishing, the publication is pour, such as the source of \"Journey to the West\", \"Datang San Tibet and poetry\", according to the book's volume, is \"Zhangjia\" named \"Zhangjia\" in Hangzhou Zhonghua Bookstore published. After listening to the story in the \"hook\", I went to the bookstore near the \"Watt\" to sell the story to the bookstore, and the bookstore will be published according to these intelligence.\n\nJust as mentioned above, listening to the novels gradually developed, and later, the novels they were gradually developed independently. At that time, \"the novel\" \"Novel\", \"said\" words \", long articles\" said \"Ping\", these works, \"Three Kingdoms\" in the future (\u53d6 \u81ea \u8bb2 \u8bb2 \u8bb2 \"),\" Water Margin \" \"(Material from\" \",\" rod stick \"),\" Journey to the West \"(from\" Self \")) has a deep origin.\n\nThis speaker of this performance art called \"speaking person\", writing a story \"Talents\" or \"Mr.\" in the scene. These people also belong to their own different organizations, such as \"eloquence\", \"books\", and so on. To Yuan Dynasty, because the readers did not have the opportunity to hide, add to the book, participate in the creation of the drama and the novel. Although the bookcraft created a lot of novels, more is the literary literature of rhyme. In the novels in the Song Dynasty, rhyme poses an important role in the work.\n\nAnother feature of the novel in the Song Dynasty is to accompany the illustration. The novel is not alone is used to read, or you can watch it. Some novels have compared text, publishers spend more mind on the illustration, such as the \"Three Kingdoms\" published by Jian'an, in the end, the illustration is delicate, but the text is rough, which is similar to today's chart or comics.\n\nIn the early days of the Yuan Dynasty, the gold country of the same is the same as the Golden Kingdom of the Ministry, did not pay attention to the culture of the South Gold and Southern Song Dynasty. But near the 13th century, the court began to have a tendency of China. They began to pay attention to Hanlin Institute and Histori, attracting talented talents as an emperor's learning and cultural consultant. Before this, the official position of this class is a reputation and is not easy to grant. Here, they attracted the famous poet Zhao Mengfu, Yuan Wei, Yu Ji, Jieshi, Fan Wei. Yang Zi and others. The last four people are more known as \"Four People in Yuan Poetry\". [23] Although they are temple poets, they have not strongly advocated literary atmosphere in the court. There is also a color poet in Sausu. Although there is no detailed biography, according to his poem, he is a temple poet in the early stage, and later became the rivers and lake poet. His pre-works are mostly rewarded, but they are similar to the later content, and there is no strong opposition to the poems with the grass. In addition, another poet Yang Weizhen, the end of his life is the husky poet, born in Jiangnan, and gave a poetry with the people who loved poetry, and criticized, admissions and guidance on poetry creation. Most of the poems are the business people, not to learn poetry for the creation of poetry.\n\nFrom the birth of the \"Lawbook\" and \"Ping\" born from the bustling area of \u200b\u200bthe Song Dynasty to become a reading, this literature is developed to the Ming Dynasty, and the content and the cultivation are greatly improved, become a high quality literary work. For example, in the Yuan Dynasty published, the article was very rough, but after the end of the last Ming Dynasty, Luo Guanzhong rewritten, the Qing Dynasty Maozonggang also made some changes, making the story more fulfilling.\n\nDuring the Ming and Qing Dynasties, this chapter returned to the novel. This novel divides the entire story into different backs, and the small part of each recording story will leave some of the contents of the listener or look at the next year. From the format of the chapter return novel, we can also imagine the speaker's speech. However, the chapter return novel is not recorded by the speaker's voice. In the early days, such as the Song Dynasty, the text of the novel is relatively rough, but after continuous washing, slowly develop the stylistic cultivation with the vernacular text. The novel used to read officially established also promoted the development of Vernacular.\n\nBefore the chapter of the Ming Dynasty, \"Lawbook\" and \"Ping\" have many rhyme components, but as the objects of the novel become readers from the audience, the proportion of rhyme is increasing, and the proportion is increased. Despite this, although the Ming Dynasty, \"Water Margin\" and \"Journey to the West\" are basically written in the prose of the mouth, but there is also a rhyme, which is a rhyme. This is the previous \"Singing Literature\". trace.\n\nWith the improvement of the novel in the quality and literary status, to the later stage of the Ming Dynasty, the southern literati, etc., the first-class literati at the time is also actively engaged in writing novels. For example, writing \"three words\" (\"Yu Shiming said\" \"Wen Shi\", \"Wake-up\") \"Two Shoots\" (\"First Shooting Surprise\" \"Two Test Case Surprising\") Short Stories of Short Stories Feng Menglong and Ling Mun It is the representative. The two actively agreed to identify the influence of the novel and clearly engaged in novel creation. For example, Feng Menglong said in the \"Wake--Bath\": \"Taking\" Ming \"\" General \"\" Henglean \"is a supplementary history of the Sixth National History.\" Although his novel is still subject to six times and national history, morality History restrictions, but compared to before, they have greatly identified the function of popular literature. He mentioned in \"Yu Shiming's words\": \"Although the\" filial piety \"\" Analects \", his touching is not necessarily, it is also too deep. \u566b! Not easy to be?\" That is, Reading \"Filial Piety\" \"Analects\", reading custom literature can affect the public's meaning.\n\nDuring the development of novel literature, when the author realizes the status of the novel is not better than traditional poetry and history, and some authors are separated from moral and historical restrictions, and try to create some novels with pure literature. \"Jin Ping Mei\" is this type of work. \"Jin Ping Mei\" although some backgrounds are self-\"Water Margin\", but with the \"Three Kingdoms\", \"Water Margin\", this works themselves have a direct relationship with the speaker of singing literature. Although the author is unknown, you can affirm that the author is a highly educated and keen observer. He borrowed the form of the society, especially human desires, and criminalists in the form of novels. Because \"Jin Ping Mei\" is not a story, it is not a moral but desire, not good and evil, can be said this is the first realistic novel in the history of Chinese novels.\n\nThe author of \"Jin Pingmei\" is different from the authors of the venue in the same period, and it is not possible to pay rewards with this novel. In this sense, \"Jin Ping Mei\" is a novel, a novel, a novel, a pure literature. \"Jin Ping Mei\" attaches the novel creation direction of personal philosophy, in the \"Dream of Red Mansions\" in the Qing Dynasty, this kind of creation is further enriched. The theme of \"Dream of Red Mansions\", in a sentence, is the author of Cao Xueqin to his life. At that time, if you want to express this topic, you will usually use traditional poems, but Cao Xueqin chose a vernacular novel.\n\nAt the same time as highly literary vita novels, some popular and popular novels still exist. The latter itself has a big relationship with the book, and the content is mostly historical or fighting. Such as \"said Tang Dynasty\" and the \"three-term five sense\" of the protagonist of Judicial Bao Zheng is the representative.\n\nTo the Qing Dynasty, there is only a masterpiece of the pure literature written by \"Red Man Dream\", \"Confucian Foreign History\", also has a popular novel created by mass entertainment, and a variety of novels appear in the literary world. In addition, there are also some novel criticism activities, such as Jin Sheng sigh, regard \"Water Margin\" as a masterpiece, and the epidemic of the novel is unprecedented.\n\nIn addition to the white narrative novel, the Ming and Qing Dynasty also appeared some famous Chinese language novels in Tang Tang, such as the \"Novel Lamp New\" and Qing Dynasty Pu Songling. The former has a great impact on the \"rain month\" of Japanese writer Shangda Chuancheng. Nonetheless, the venue novels are still the mainstream of the novel world.\n\nThe popularity of the novels, in addition to the development of art culture itself, is also related to the booming bookstore for business activities. At the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, there is a \"Book Ship\", and the activities of the rental publication in various places; in Beijing, the Bookstore Forest. These bookstores are generally rules, and there is a description of the imprint of \"Yue Yue Chunqiu\" in the late Qing Dynasty:\n\nDuring the Ming Dynasty, Tang Xianzu wrote a lot of drama works, one of the most important players in the Ming Dynasty. His representative was \"Zi Mi\", \"The Soul (Peony Pavilion)\", \"Naki Ke\", \"Not\". Since the four works are to carry out story plots, it is also known as \"Yushu Tang Fourth Dream\", and \"Yu Mingtang\" is the name of Tang Xianzu. [25]\n\nIn the among the \"still soul\" is the best, this is not alone in the Ming Dynasty, and is also high quality work in the history of the South. The story tells a pair of men and women Du Li and Liu Mengmei understand each other by his dreams, and then Du Li Niang died because of suffering. Later, after many twists and turns, she finally woke up from the tomb and together with the male protagonist. This is a strange story of a dream and reality, born with death, and the author takes a beautiful article to carry out another scene. The rumors have children to commit suicide because they like this work very much. Beautiful Du Li is strolling in the garden, sleeping on a moment due to fatigue. In the dream, she and Liu Mengmei have encountered the \"shock dream\" scene, now still staged and loved, the following is one of them:\n\nIt turned out that it is like this, it seems that it is also paid and broken.\nYushen Tianjing He Tian, \u200b\u200bwho is happy to be happy.\n\nIn addition, he was based on the Kunkun cavity in Jiangnan, which was based on this beautiful tune, and the style of the heavy band returning, and the content of the play is life, and this advocates practice. At that time, the representative of the Wujiang Party of Kunshan cavity Shen Yu was dissatisfied with the ancestors of Tang Xianzu, and triggered the battle. At the same time, agree to the Tang's claim to become a Linchuanpai. In addition to Tang Xianzu in the middle of the Ming Dynasty, there are also Liangchenfish (\"Ying Yingji\"), Shen Wei (\"Yixia\"), Zhou Chao (\"Red Mei Ji\"), high-spirited (\"Yu Yu Ji\") and so on.\n\nMany of them are literati who have been traditionally educated. Everyone also uses the creation of poetry to create the opera. This makes it only to one of the official literature, but it also affects the theme of the opera. Ming Dynasty's legendary half work is a story that surrounded by talents, and the style of the metamorphic drafts and the style of all walks of life. In fact, in the end of the Yuan Dynasty, he wrote \"\u7435\u7436\". He itself is also a famous poet, and his \"\u7435\u7436\" is also the first drama work that is written by the readers, laying the direction of the development of the Ming Dynasty. His words are some of the gentle words and sentences, which is far from the city of well-life.\n\nSince then, in the Qing Dynasty, the Qing Dynasty, two famous works have appeared in the Kunqu, which are Hongsheng's \"Changsheng Temple\" and the \"peach fans\" of Kong Shang. The Changsheng Temple is written in Kangxi for 27 years (1688), the story tells the story of Tang Xuanzong and Yang Guifei, which is known in Bai Juyi \"Song Song\", a total of fifty. The first half of the narrative is divided by the chaos of Anchi, and the second half is narrative that Tang Xuanzong arrived in Wonderland in order to find Yang Guifei. The last big reunion end. This was published immediately, but the year was staged during the royal family, and Hong Sheng was imprisoned.\n\nAnother work \"Peach Fan\", a total of forty. The story is the main shaft with the true character Hou Fang Domain and Li Xiangjun, which is a historical drama that draws the fate of the people in the big incident of the Ming Dynasty. When this set of dramas, the Emperor Kangxi heard the style of this drama, and also search the drama of this drama. Due to the description of the Dynasties Dynasties, Kong Shang, I felt that I felt anger, I'm eager to evil. But there is also a saying that he left because of corruption.\n\nNow, China continues to stage the classical drama headed by Beijing Opera, but the generation of these drama is not necessarily related to the aforementioned Nanyu. The opera staged by the courts in the Qing Emperor Qianlong period can be divided into \"Ya Di\" from the Ming Dynasty to continue to sing Kunqu, and the \"flower department\" from the local drama and diverse melody. Relative to the \"Ya\" gradually declined, although the formation of Peking Opera has not yet been stated, it is also believed to be the foundation of some of the Kunqu in the \"flower department\", and then the actor is improved. The Peking Opera is compared to the scorpion and the Chinese opera melody, and the number of words is also strictly restricted (uniform). Such operas may have existed when they have earlier, but they have not seen it. In the late Qing Dynasty, Peking Opera gradually replaced a place in literature, prevalent.\n\nIn ancient times, literary works are mainstream in classical Chinese, with a small part of the white-speaking work, and the white-speaking works are generally over the Sui and Tang Dynasties. Because the oral and written have been completed. Go to Ming Dynasty, \"Water Margin\", \"Journey to the West\", \"Dream of Red Mansions\", \"Jin Ping Mei\" became a famous vanish work. Since the Qing Dynasty, Vernacular Works have begun to increase. After the Republic of China, I entered the modernity. After a vernacular movement, in addition, the government promotes the educational education, and the veninge works gradually occupied.\n\nSince 1949, the Chinese Communist Party seized the regime [26], the publishing authority was held by the state. The issuance channel of the book is unified, and the writer is also monitored by the Writers Alliance. The strict review system took effect, and literary works as the \"speech at Yan'an Literature and Art Symposium\" in Mao Zedong as a guiding principle, emphasizing the ideological of the work. This time, there were some criticisms and cooking because they did not meet the principles of literature, such as Hu Shi and Hu Feng. Social realism becomes a established style, which eventually triggered conflicts between government and writers. Before the Communist Party seized the power of the political power, the writer's ironic and revealing the ability of today's society, although he helped to expand the Communist Party, it was no longer supported by the Pigained Communist Party. Some writers have been approved as \"small assets idealism\", \"humanism\", and so on due to adhering to the literary concept of the party. These struggles finally evolved into a hundred flowers (1956-1957). Mao Zedong encourages writers to say new social problems. But due to the lessons learned from antihuy, the initial writers are also very unwilling. Later, some news articles, movies, and literary works have focused on bureaucracy and dictatorships in some levels in the party. Mao Zedong realized that intellectuals were dissatisfied with new regimes, launched the anti-right movement of these intellectuals, many intellectuals were attacked. During the Great Leap Forward, the government strengthened the encouragement of social reality and some so-called revolutionary realism, revolutionary romanticism, etc. Writers can write some works about contemporary China or in the Republic of China, but the big premise is to consistent with the ideal of the party's revolution.\n\nAlthough the writer under the Mao Zedong regime is rude, there are still some quality novels. For example, some new socialist literature, including: Liu Qing's \"Entrepreneurial History\", Yang Mo's \"Youth Song\", Qulo's \"Linhai Snowland\", Liang Bin's \"Red Flag\", Wu Qiang's \"Red Day\", Luo Guangbin And Yang Yi Yan's \"Red Rock\". In the Cultural Revolution, the literary altar was forced by the fourth wife of Mao Zedong. The scope of literary movements continued to narrow, leaving only a small amount of model play and hero novels, such as Haoran. Although there are some writers in secret creation, there is no important work in this period.\n\nIn 1976, with the four-person help of Jiang Qing, [27] passed the reform in the 11th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in December 1978, which enable writers to start creative. Many literary works \"New Period\" explored issues that were seriously abused at the national and regional levels during the cultural revolutionary period. Many writers criticized in this decade to waste a lot of time and heart and complain about China. At the same time, writers express their willingness to contribute to the country. Such literature, generally known as \"scar literature\", with a concern of party and political system. For the enthusiasm of patriotism, these writers cynicizely criticize the political leadership to push confusion to extremes in the Cultural Revolution. Some writers have expanded criticism to the leadership and political system of the whole generation. Putors face a severe problem: How can they make these criticisms to tolerate? When encouraging writers to critical the revolutionary revolutionary revolution, how can these criticisms do not exceed their limits?\n\nIn this period, many novels and short stories were published. The literary magazine before the Cultural Revolution re-enrollment, and the new literary magazine has also successively invited the appetite of the public. Among them, foreign works become the theme of magazines. Linguists are entrusted to translate new foreign literary works, and there are not careful consideration of Chinese readers. Literary magazines dedicated to translation of foreign short story became popular, especially between young people.\n\nThese dramatic changes have made some governments, literature, and art worlds. The new thinking is too fast. In 1980, the government was first responded and promoted against bourgeois liberalism, and the same movement was also re-launched in 1981. Then, these two difficult times are the removal of mental pollution in the late 1983. [28] [29]\n\nAt the same time, writers are still free to write some non-traditional or sensitive works. The spirit of literary trials has been prosperous in the 1980s. The novel writers such as Wang Meng, Zhang Xinxin, Zong Yan and dramatis are trying to create in modern language and description. In addition, some writers jointly launched \"root sports\", including Han Shaoong, Mo Yan, Acheng. They seek to re-contacted literature and culture to the Chinese tradition, this relationship has been cut off in the century of modernization and political cultural innovation. Other writers such as Yu Hua, Gefei, Su Tong trying to have a more avant-garde writing technique to boldly show that they have lost confidence in any form.\n\nWith the outbreak of the 1989 June, the more fierce the market, the more fierce, and the \"Chinese contemporary literature and culture began to biased the commercialization and escape reality. Wang Hao, known as the scorpion, is the most obvious represented representative, although his novel is not a deep theme. Some writers such as Yan Lianke continue to shoulder the responsibility of exposing social issues by literature. His novel \"Dingzhuang Dream\" talks about the distant conditions of AIDS patients [30].\n\nJust like May 4th, female writers are also active in today's China. Many female writers, such as Chen Ran, Wei Hui, Wang Anyi, and Hong Sha will try to explore women's subjectivity in a fiercely changed society. New realistic writers such as Liu Heng, Chi Li, Fang Fang, He Don, Zhu Wen is another trend of novel creation in the novel after the June 4th incident.\n\nThe Press and Publication Administration of the Chinese government is responsible for review all Chinese literary works that will be disclosed. This organ has the right to review and prohibit any form in China's printing, electronics or Internet publications. Since the publisher must obtain the licensing license of this organ, this organ also has the right to deny the rights of the people and the full turnover that does not comply with this organ indication. Therefore, the proportion of genuine books with piracy is 2: 3. According to Zonaeuropa report, there are more than 4,000 underground printing plants in China. Although the Chinese government continues to ban welcoming but believes is \"spiritual pollution\", those criticisms are just focusing on the public's line of sight to the number of soldings and stimulating the number of books. Many new generation Chinese writers are closely looked at the Chinese government. They have re-published their works into English, and there is a good result in the Western book market, such as Zhou Weibi's \"Shanghai Baby\", Zu'an Qi's context Recalling \"Red Azalea\", \"Times magazine\" banned \"Beijing Doll\" and \"Sugar\" of cotton wool in Chun Sue. The online best-selling book \"Ghost Blow\" also has to be overridden before the birthday, and delete the part of the supernatural.\n\n\nAfter the 1980s of freedom, due to the opening of the book, in the 1990s, we can see the literary and strong commercial taste. According to Wu Detrin, these trends are:\n\nHowever, Chinese literature showed a look like a commercial issue like 1980 and 1990 in the early 21st century. For example, Han Han \"His National\" (2009), his critical society's super-realistism hit the mainstream of criticism, but won the first place in 2009 Chinese bestseller.\n\nIn the new millennium, China's online literature is more active than the United States or even the rest of the world [34], almost all books can be found online, and there are millions of readers in the novel, and the average selling price is also RMB 2. Yuan, is one tenth of the average price of print books. The popular writers of online literature have Han Han and Guo Jingming.\n\nChinese literature is also popular in overseas Chinese circles in Southeast Asia, Europe and the United States. China is the world's largest book, magazine and publisher. According to the information distribution of the Press and Publishing Administration, on the publication of a single book, there is already a new title in 128,800 in 2005. There are also more than 600 Chinese magazines in the country. In France lives and writing and insists on the first Chinese to create the first Chinese to win the Nobel Literature Award. In 2012, Mo Yan also won the Nobel Literature Award. [35]\n\nIn addition, some scientific fictions have also caused people's attention. Liu Cixin's \"Three Body\", Hao Jingfang's \"Beijing Fold\" and other works quickly sell well and won the Roofout Award [36] [37] [38]. However, while obtaining achievements, some people have excessively leading proud, touting, and controversial criticism and dispute [39].\n\nRegarding the proportion of ethnic minorities in China, from the National Writer Organization - China Writers Association, in 1986, a total of 3106 general members, and 288 in the minority, more than 9%, higher than the proportion of population. From the perspective of national classification, more than 30 people in Mongolia and Korean are the most membership; second is the Manchu, Uighurs and Hui, each has more than 20 people.\n\nWhat languages \u200b\u200buse language for ethnic minorities? Generally, they use Chinese and national language to create, such as Uighur, Kazakh, North Korea, Mongolia and Tibetan nationals own their own language and text, and literary traditions written in written language, especially Uighur, Kazakh, North Korea, Big Some of them are created with their own language, and more than half of the Mongolian people use Mongolian, while in both Mongolian and Chinese. About Tibetans, in addition to the Tibetan Autonomous Region, Chinese and Tibetan magazines have also developed Chinese and Tibetan magazines in autonomous states such as Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan, Yunnan. It can be seen that there are many people who have created with Tibetan. On the other hand, Manchu lost its own language, use Chinese to create; the large number of ethnic minorities have saved their national language, but they have no text, but some authors are also using Chinese to write their works. From 1956 to 58, Zeng Zhuang, Miao, Yi Lang, Yi, Hanni, Scenery, Sword, etc., but due to the confusion of the later national policy, it failed. Even so, these minorities still work hard to create, such as the \"March 3\" creation of Zhuang people in the autumn of 1986, and included the work of Zhuang. The novel of Zhuang language has published more than 200 articles in the next few years. Most authors are the initial young newcomers, and they are not always using the Zhuang language writer created by Chinese.\n\nThe scope of minority literature has always been speechless. Some people think that as long as the author is a minority, the work written is a minority literature; but on the other hand, some writers cannot simply say a few ethnic literary writers.\n\nIf a minority writer uses his own language to describe its own national life, although it can be classified as a minority literature, the writer can be classified as a minority literature, for some How many people have doubtful. Chinese classic classics refers to Chinese and other Chinese character cultural circles (Japan, Korean Peninsula, Vietnam, Ryukyes and other places), mainly, mainly to pass historical elimination options, which are recognized by people to reach the cultural level of a nation. Height, depth, and breadth works, including historical literature, literary works, etc.  In the Chinese character culture area outside China, although there is a local language, some have created their own words, but Chinese characters, Chinese (classical Chinese) have long been the official language in these areas, so there are also many Chinese writings. , Including historical books, official documents, literary works, academic books. This type of book is usually referred to as a Chinese in order to write a classic code written in the local language. Diet - Apparel - Architecture - Cultural Relics - Festival - Folk - Education\nScience - Five-Trim (Medical - Surgery) - Wushu\n\nChinese martial arts is an important part of Chinese traditional culture. The early days of the Republic of China is referred to as national surgery (after the name of the Central Columbus, the Taiwan is also used in this name), which is considered to be the essence of Chinese culture, so it is also known as \"national quintes\". Due to historical development and regional distribution relationship, different genres are derived. The main contents of Chinese martial arts include combating techniques, fighting techniques, offensive and defense strategies, and weapons. It is divided into two categories of theory and practice. Practice is mainly referred to as important functions such as sports and Chinese martial arts uniqueness, and health, theoretical part is a martial arts experience and box record. Therefore, it reflects the understanding of the martial arts and strategies of the Chinese nation. Plus experience accumulation, self-operation, self-reliant, and healthy health, and the exercise routine show the beautiful gesture of body movements. Chinese martial arts often bring the cultural characteristics of the ideological and refined chains and the characteristics of human philosophy, meaning, and the far-reaching influence on the popular culture in China.\n\nThe origin of Chinese martial arts can be traced back to the primitive society. At that time, the human beings used to fight with the beasts, and gradually accumulated some attacked experience. The business generation is an important means of being treated with martial arts training.\n\nDuring the business period, using the \"Wu Dance\" to train soldiers and boost. Therefore, martial arts can exercise in a dance form. Zhou Dynasty set \"Preface\", \"Preface\" and other schools also listed the shot and habits to one of the education contents. During the Spring and Autumn Warring States Period, each vassal country attached great importance to the use of fighting technology in the battlefield. Qi Qigong held a \"angular test\" in the spring and autumn to select the world hero. In this period, the manufacturing and Keyway of the sword were unprecedented development. During the Qin and Han Dynasties, the customs of the horn, fencing, and feast is happy. There is a Xiangzhuang dance sword in Hongmen Banquet. Its form is closer to today's martial arts routine. The application of the Han Dynasty has reached the peak, and various guns begin to appear. According to the first \"five birds\", it is the abuse of Chinese martial arts.\n\nPeople think that martial arts originate in combat, but the book \"Chinese Wushu - History and Culture\" is proposed that although some from military needs, most of them come from civil affairs. Martial arts and civil martial arts requirements are different.\n\n\"National Geographic Magazine\" believes in the TV show of \"Zheng He Xiaoxi\", the Northern Dynasties, Buddhist Zen Bezua Motor may bring India's martial arts into the Shaolin Temple of Zhongtonghe South.\n\nThe early development of Chinese martial arts lacks text records, which can only be passed down by the teacher.\n\nThere are many Chinese martial arts, and it is very rare in World Wushu. According to statistics, there are more than 300 fists in China currently \"clear history, context, unique style, and self-contained system\". In Guo Xiwei's \"China Sports History\" mentioned that there are many martial arts martial arts due to different geography, climate and people in north and south. The northerners have a high body, and the cold weather is harmful to the northern part of the North School. Southern water, the southerners are short, and the boxing is more delicate. The proverb also has the saying \"Nanquan North Leg\". Of course, this is not absolute, such as from the northern gossip palm, rarely attacks [source request], and the Southern Wing Chun has many legs skills.\n\nThere is a lot of Chinese martial arts, but there is no unified naming method. Some are named by the region (such as Henan sent a punch); some according to the mountain, river (such as Wudang); there is a name of the masters (such as Yang's Taijiquan) ... In the past, these genre will be maintained in the maintenance, and the external work is rough Divided, becoming two categories: both inner boxing and foreign fists.\n\nIn 1949, after the construction of the CPC, the orthodox commitment and martial arts have stopped. Only some martial arts of some martial arts are compiled into fitness and performance routines, teachers students in primary and secondary schools.\n\nAfter the reform is open, it is generally divided into two categories of rolling and fighting. With the development of fighting movements, Chinese martial arts have turned to more practical Sanda.\n\nAfter the fifth generation, the Liang people were in the \"Review\" book, alleged \"...\" \u86a9 \u86a9 \u6c0f \u4eba \u4eba \u89dd \u89dd \u89dd \u89dd \u89dd \u89dd \u89dd \u89dd \u5411 \u89dd \u89dd \u89dd, \u5411 \u89dd \u89dd \u89dd \u89dd \u89dd \u89dd \u89dd \u89dd \u89dd \u89dd, It refers to the oldest wrestling. The Yellow Emperor, the Supreme Times has completely improved social organizations and combat types, so although they can not be present, they can be seen as a master.\n\nThe Spring and Autumn Warring States era also have a record of wrestling. Lu Weiwei wrote \"Breaky Month Order\" to mention that Zhou Tianzi will train the wrestling skills to train the craftsmanship training, and the two army struggle competition is called \"angle\". On the one hand, we can test the martial arts, and then collect the effect of the team to practice the troops. In addition, \"Lu's Spring and Autumn\", \"Huainanzi\" has a similar description.\n\nAfter the Qin Dynasty unified China, in the current Shaanxi Province Xianyang City, the Qin and Han Dynasties were created in the Qin and Han Dynasties in Shaanxi, and the development to the Ming Dynasty was changed as the red boxing place.\n\nWhen Li Shimin, Tang Dynasty, there was a record of Shaolin Temple in Henan Province and a record. Wu Zetian booked a martial arts system in 702 [1], the electoral army will give talents, and use the exam to grant a certain title, which greatly promotes the development of martial arts. Song, Ming, Qing also abolished, until the end of the Qing Dynasty, all of them have the hered system of the soldiers army, and the martial arts have become a cultural form, and the genre admission will affect the country of Southeast Asia.\n\nThe Song Dynasty is the branch of the prohibition of private groups and private weapons. In the first year of 1127 (South Song Jian Yan), Song Ranked South Movement, with Yue Fei, Han Shizhong, under the proposal, most of the military and civilians were in the middle of the military and centered on Hangzhou. Hangzhou is spreading for the south box, the fist is more than the upper limbs, the elbow is supplemented, and there are very few flying to the ground. \"Boxing Wastern\" [2]. He is said that there is \"Yue Wu Mu Wang Jianjing\". It is a pity that there is no history from the ancestral teacher.\n\n1156 (Shaoxing twenty-six), the court established martial arts in Lin'an. 1180 (\u7199 seven years), set \"Wushu Liang from the Military Law\", the school weapon can take the fame.

(With five teachers too, Fang Yongchun, Yan Yichun as the conceptual symbol of the soft boxing).\n\nIn 1909, since the founding of Huo and Huo Yuanjia in Shanghai (At that time, after the first folk martial arts group) Jingwu Gymnastics Association, Foshan, Hankou, Guangzhou, Zhangzhou, Nanning and other places were established and influenced. And, overseas branches such as Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, etc. also have established. The purpose of the Jingwu Gymnastics Association is to promote martial arts, research sports, and cast strong people.\n\nChina Sami will be a large-scale private martial arts association established under the North China League Association, which is organized by Ye Yun Table, Ma Fengchao and others. In the same way, we will improve Chinese martial arts and invigorate national spirit. In the autumn of 1912, a grand martial arts show held in Hebei Park in Tianjin.\n\nIn 1912, Beijing Sports Research Society was established in Beijing, Heng Zhiyun, Yang Zizi, Zhao Xinzhou, Hengshou Mountain, Ji Zi Xiu, Gao Kexing, Yan Ruiyi. The purpose is to develop martial arts sports, cultivate talents, and achieve the purpose of strong national salvation. [4]\n\nIn the early years of the Republic of China, the folks are relatively stable and economic transformation. Guarantee \u9573, hood, pilot, all transferred to the martial arts, many new genres appeared. In the late Qing Dynasty, Li Jinjun's martial arts is also the boxing of the Yuan Shikai's new army, and the straight warfare is successive. The National Government actively supports the people's martial arts. Martial arts sports class is also established in major advanced colleges.\n\nWu style Taiji, the Early Republic of China, said that she said to the Song Song Ming of Yuan Shikai, claiming to have a Taijiquan of Yuanzu Song Yuanqiao. Said Zhang Sanfeng Chuan Zhang Songxi and Zhang Cuishan, and Fu Song Duanqiao, named 13 style.\n\nIn 1915 (four years of the Republic of China), the Zhonghua Book Company published the \"Shaolin Boxing Tips\" written by the owners. The content is like a martial arts novel. Now it is said to the so-called \"Shaolin Pai\". The following is the legendary novel of Shaolin. Such as Zhao Shi's \"South Shaolin Legend\", \"Fire Burn Shaolin Temple\", etc. In 1918 (Seven Years of Republic of China), the Loud Book Company published the so-called \"Yulin Boxing Jun\" combined with the \"Voltivity Chart\" and \"Yi Ji Jingyi\" in Lu Shizhen. The content is not related to Shaolin Boxing. In 1926, the Kuomintang began in the Northern Expedition. On March 6, 1927, Shaolin Temple hosted Miaoling and the Joined the Beiyang warlord, in the dance Yang, only 37 years old. In 1928, Shaolin Temple in Shaoshan was burned in the warlord.\n\nThere are many new martial arts in the martial arts in the early years of the Republic of China. They all said that they have exactly the best of Shaolin five old, Shaolin Temple, Wudang School and \u5d4b \u5d4b. However, this revealed their \"new\", and its purpose is to \"source orthodox\", and most of the substance is mixed by several Master. Sophistication and other Shaolin five, for the late Qing Dynasty, in the late Qing Dynasty, the Wushu novel \"Wan Yong\" in Guangdong, and the other \"Qianlong Huntuan Jiangnan\", is selling. There is no more records in the history of the Ming and Qing Dynasties. \"Wan Yong\" is popular in Guangzhou and Foshan in Guangdong Province in the late Qing Dynasty. At that time, the famous boxing of the land had a Wing Chun boxing (complied with the five teachers to ancestors); Hong Bun, Hua fl flut (now Shaolin Yongchun) and Cai Li Buddha (complied with the ancestors of the ancestors); Huaquhao (complied with the ancestral teacher); Dongjiang Bun (obeying the opposite of the opposite). The novel believes in writing the plot of the Han people in Guangzhou computer room according to the above-mentioned number of martial arts.\n\nIn the early days of the Republic of China, advocating \"strong country\", martial arts encouraged and implemented. In 1927, in order to further manage the respective political and strong martial arts groups, the National Government has set up a central Chinese-Chinese library in Nanjing, and established a pre-evaluation office, Tang Fan Sheng (Hao) as the head office. Due to the true martial art history of Tang, it is not possible to have some powerless people. A lot of Hostu (pseudo) handwritten is collected by the subsequent pre-examination.\n\nAt the time of the Military Foreign Large, there were Li Jinglin, Zhang Zhijiang and Du Xin five, etc., please ask the martial arts of each school to teach. Divide Chinese martial arts into two doors of Shaolin and Wudang, and then subdivided. The martial art officially appeared. At that time, Manyu (claiming to be Du Xin Wu) called himself to send a natural door for the moth. Since then, the eight major martial arts appeared on martial arts novels, officially fighting, and all the ancestors, one authentic.\n\nIn December 1927, the willered Zhang Zhijiang founded the Martial Arts Institute under the support of Cai Yuanpei of educators. In the slogan of \"Strong Savings\" and \"Royal Examination\" as the slogan, the Nanjing government and local army also laid martial arts as the main surgery of training the army, so they have set off martial arts hot, all provinces and cities and counties. \"\" Has been established. [5]\n\nSince the heart of Japanese aggression has appeared, the patriotic anti-gold hero Yue Fei, and the success from the foreign national retrieval of the politicism of Ming Taizu Zhu Yuanzhang was made into Shaolin hero. After that, many so-called martial arts handwritten secrets, all called Yue Fei, Zhu Yuanzhang, Qi Jiguang and Yu Emirates against foreign enemy hero; all have a relationship with Shaolin Temple.\n\n1929 (18 years of the Republic of Republic) published the \"Book of the Book of Book\" by Shi Pei, said that it was made by Cao Huanou, and collected Kangxi, Zhang Kong Zhao's boxing. [6] In the same year, Zhang Zhijiang, Li Jinglin held the \"Wushu Games\" in the \"West Lake Expo\" in Hangzhou.\n\nIn 1932, Jin Enzhong claimed to be a seventy-two technique for the Miaoxing and Shangxing of Shaolin Temple. In 1933, the singer of the singer of the singer of the singer of the singer of the singer of the singer of the singer of the singer of the singer of the singer of the singer of the singer of the singer of the singer of \"\u4f57 \u4f57 \u4f57 \u672f\" and \"Acupuncture\". It has been published \"Shaped Boxing Lecture\", \"Xiangxiang Boxing True\", \"Ling Venean Teacher Points\".\n\nIn August 1936, the Chinese martial art team went to the Berlin Olympics to participate in the performance. In the same year, \"\u87eb \u87eb \u5e90\" published a \"Boxing\" full of \"Boxing\". After the Tang Hao test, it may be the legal law of the Ming Dynasty and Yulin Mu Xuan Juan.\n\nSince then, China has experienced the World War and the country's civil war, and the development of martial arts is not developed.\n\nIn 1950, the official Zhonghua National Sports Club established martial arts to serve the people's health. The Communist Party implements a public system and cannot be awarded privately. Some famous fist, famous boxing, such as Wing Chun, etc.\n\nIn 1956, the China National Sports Association established a Chinese martial arts association to raise martial arts as performance projects, and established a martial arts team. Chinese martial arts association management and allocation of all martial arts practitioners. There are only twelve martial arts units nationwide. Professor pays attention to the legacy of the fitness and Qigong. Like Yang's Taiji twenty-four, fan dance, sword dance, etc., Magnolia and other aerobics. In 1957, the Chinese Wushu Association organized the martial arts association in various provinces and municipalities. In 1960, mid-local, primary schools labeled martial arts as physical education content.\n\nFrom 1966, martial arts were denied during the Cultural Revolution. Old fist books were destroyed. The martial art workers are cleared. 1966 - 1982, within 16 years, martial arts development is completely paused in China.\n\nFrom 1983 to 1986, the State Sports Committee (referred to as the State Sports Committee) made a martial arts census and re-entered the content of martial arts units (martial art). In 1984-1993, there were two top Chinese Chinese national competitions, and there were two kinds of performances and fight competitions. The three sides of the strait and the international representative of the \"City\" grade, each country is not necessarily each \"city\" \"There are representatives, but each ninth (45kg level to 85 kg) event has more than one hundred representatives to compete for sixty-four, and it is very feat; the competition will end due to the political contradiction between the two sides. Hold. In 1993, China was substantially involved in China. This year, the competition system contains the origin of origin.\n\nIn 1985, the first International Wushu Invitational Tournament was held in Xi'an and established a preparatory Committee of the International Martial Arts Federation. At this point, local martial arts groups have settled or recovered, such as Shaolin Temple, Jingwu Sports Club, Wudang Road Wushu Institute, China Emei Wushu Research Association. The so-called (eight or ten) menisses have appeared again.\n\nIn 1987, the first Asian martial art tournament was held in Yokohama. In 1990, martial arts was first included in the eleventh \"Asian Games\" competition project. In 1999, International Wuling was absorbed as a member of the official International Sports Senior Association of the International Olympic Committee, which is a sign of Chinese martial arts toward the world.\n\nAt present, the Wushu Movement Management Center (formerly known as the Martial Arts Management Center of the People's Republic of China) and the National Sports General Administration Institute (originally known as the Chinese Wushu Institute). The National Martial Arts Organization - China Martial Arts Association is also one of the individual sports associations under the leadership of China National Sports Association. It is generally initiated by them to organize martial arts sports competition. The above organization believes that martial arts should turn to a strong fitness and competitive sports competition.\n\nIn addition, there is an international martial arts federation (English: International Wushu Federation, abbreviated as IWUF) to promote martial arts, and believe that martial arts should be a kind of competitive sports, and organize international \"standard routine\" competition. Therefore, the martial arts competition is criticized as a performance \"dance\", no practical hit, just the gymnastics of Huayuan embroidered legs. At present, there are 114 Member States in the International Martial Arts Union. Therefore, China officially launched a Sanda Movement since the 1980s. However, this has been criticized, and many negative people do not recognize that it is calculated as Chinese martial arts, criticizing it is the leg law of Thai, boxing, plus some four unlike paintings (because Chinese traditional martial arts Pretty and it is completely either).\n\nChina's boxing has developed a long boxing system, and two systems in the Ming Dynasty. In the early days of the Qing Dynasty, the development of the above two major systems were mixed.\n\nWhen Qianlong, the Tai Chi Boxing was a simplified long boxing system with five lines of gossip and other ideas, the same farewell boxes will be boxed. Mixed above three major systems play out modern boxing system, including Wing Chun, Dacheng, Jamaday, and now Wu Xu, Emei.\n\nThe study of Chinese martial arts is currently enrolled in the martial arts or some martial arts teaching venues. Traditional martial artists studying in the people still maintain many ancient traditions, need someone to recommend, then post the post to worship the teacher. Although it has rarely \"three years old, the teacher is three years\", it will still have a long observation period, let the master understand whether the apprentice can teach; let the apprentiuses understand whether the master's work can learn .\n\nThe cultivation of Chinese martial arts, all gates are different. It is generally included basic skills, routines, internal strength and external work. In particular, the internal strength and external work are regarded as the most important content by all the factions. The statement of \"inspiring one breath, external practice bone skin\", refuses to show people, even if their apprentices are not necessarily pouring . [Source Request]\n\nIn terms of internal strength, the main Chinese medicine theory is the meridian of Chinese medicine. TCM believes that \"meridians are the table, the organs of the organs\", cultivating the meridians, will have the effect of conditioning, consolidating and enhancing the viscera. The internal strength of Chinese martial arts is mainly inner gas, and meridians are channels running in the internal gas. The intra gas is operated in a manner in a manner. effect. [Source Request]\n\nIn terms of external work, many external practices should be aid with drugs. The auxiliary role is mainly divided into auxiliary practice, healing, conditioning and enhanced body corresponding parts and organs. The action of drugs generally includes multiple aspects therein.\n\nThe basic work of Chinese martial arts is different. Generally there is station pile, such as station horse step; a method of flexibility of various exercise limbs (similar to the training method of modern other sports projects); some basic movements and basic routines practice. This is for traditional martial arts. For the current routine martial arts, it has certain athletes, and directly learning the routine action, and pays attention to the basic skills of traditional martial arts.\n\nThe basic skills of Chinese martial arts pay attention to \"the body of the hand, the spiritual power\". There is a punch, palm, hook, \"four hits eight law 12\".\n\nIt is mainly to use breathing, Tunne, luck, and make an intention to focus and cooperate with physical action to enhance the effect of attack and defensive action.\n\nInternal work practice: Most of ordinary people cultivation as a method of strong body fitness. If you have long-term persistence and practice your ability, you can make your spirits, the whole body is highly comfortable, and your body can be enhanced. If you do a long-term exercise as a masterbatch, you can significantly increase the muscle explosive [source request], and enhance the physical strength [source request]. Some major genre, there are efforts to make internal gas. [Source Request]\n\nBecause Chinese folk thinking is far from the past. Taoism has a statement that the big horizon (the world) and the small universe (body) can communicate with each other, so there is so-called Qigong or internal practice. In this context, some martial arts schools in China also have \"raise\", \"training\", \"luck\". At first, the internal strength is not the content of Chinese martial arts. After a long development, it is gradually combined with Qigong.\n\nDifferent genities have the same understanding of \"qi\", but the difference in the imagination of the atmosphere is similar to the imagination of the atmosphere. It is similar to the gas in the theory of Chinese medicine, but is different from air or other gases in modern science. The internal gas is also known as \"real gas\" or \"qi\", and the internal gas is roughly divided into two categories of motion and moving. The former has a certain action routine with breathing, the idea is enhanced to the internal gas, promoted, and widely flowing. Such as Tai Chi, etc .; the latter mainly rely on breathing and ideas to achieve the same purpose. The latter is more difficult. Also, due to depth conditions, it is susceptible to external interference (that is, the so-called \"fire into the magic\"). [Source Request]\n\nMainly to exercise the intensity of the bone skin, the use of practicing hands, eyes, body, steps and shoulders, elbows, wrists, knee, and knees, to strengthen the power of attacks and defensive movements.\n\nThe practice method is similar to those similar to other skills, and it is repeatedly hit a certain hardness goal or repeatedly hit it. However, in Chinese martial arts, traditional Chinese medicine practicing is also an important role, including healing and Conditioning the body.\n\nEffect of external work: The purpose of external work is to increase its own fight against the fight, and the other is to increase the power of attack. Because martial arts as a combat combat mean has already basically disappeared, only a few people are practicing external work. The content of the disclosed performance and armed police training includes a brick slamming the head, the brick is broken and the head is not damaged. Over earlier periods on external public performances have a performance in which the knife guns in the period and group.\n\nChinese martial arts a more significant feature is that there are many sets of roads. The routine is a series of actions containing the actions of martial arts and attack defense. All their families have many sets of jackets that express their own portals, and the routine is gradual, and the junctions of beginners and practicing people learn are different. At present, although the martial arts athletes will learn very different sets of routines, it is not clear for their hit and attack and defense.\n\nIn traditional martial arts, there are many initials in the early days of the routine, let the learners feel the meaning of luck, and the impact of the attack. And this practice is repeatedly carried out, and it is necessary to carefully understand the effect of the movement in the actual anti-reflex, it can carefully understand the effect. For example, Guo Yunxiao, who is known as \"half-step collapse to play the world\", and the enemy always uses a moving collapse, and strictly just half a move, but it is enough to defeat the opponent.\n\nThe main source of martial arts instruments is the weapons of the cold weapons, such as swords, knives, guns, sticks, etc. In ancient China, the sword once is the most important short weapon on the battlefield, which will give the knife. The martial artists have the most widely studied instruments with swords and knives.\n\nOther martial arts instruments include non-combat weapons such as moth eyebird, nunchakows, or some daily life, such as embroidery needles, stone mill, iron pot, sickle, umbrella, and so on.\n\nChinese martial arts always give people a mysterious color. This is of course the impact of martial arts novels and kungfu films. However, China's martial arts itself is due to the impact of traditional traditional partial laws (see \"Chinese Martial Arts - History and Culture\"), most of them are secret teaching, and the crucial place is even more than the words, but the teacher is said. Therefore, just in accordance with books, basically it is impossible to truly learn. It is also because of this, many boxes have gradually extracted, slowly become a topic of Yi Wen or Square.\n\nChinese martial arts is very different in the performance of martial arts and martial arts in other regions. China's martial arts is a different level of competition. Therefore, Chinese martial arts produces an empty hand in an empty hand of an empty hand and a weapon, and the martial arts used in the plane, and the hidden instruments used when the passenger does not preparation. Wait. Even the monkey fist also has a leg gate Also absorbed.\n\nThe actual combat fight of Chinese martial arts is exaggerated due to literature and movies. The handicrafts between martial artists use the form of push hands, point until. And the truly struggle is not like a lot of people to understand, and it is half a day, and most of them are only a few rounds.\n\nIn terms of actual competition, the existing Chinese traditional martial arts programming film information can be found in an embarrassment, whether it is Chinese martial arts against modern struggle or with foreign skills exchange, most traditional martial arts players or participation People often have a trick to the double boxing, the legs make the legs like a scattered leg or a blank handkerchief, and even the scene that caught the opponent and wants a lot of fell, and even more people can see the game The two are almost close to the village fighting of martial arts, and the traditional martial arts exquisite technology did not see. The demonstration is a matter of routine dismantling. In fact, the game is playing again, and it can see the boxing, the kick, the mutant, the power to see the power and momentum Not as far as shed.\n\nWhat kind of realm of Chinese martial arts can practice, it is a problem that is difficult to answer. According to Taijiquan's statement, the highest realm can reach \"a feather can't be added, mosquito can't fall\", that is, a feathers encountered his body, can be bounced in him. But can anyone can achieve this ideal realm?\n\nChinese martial arts is one of the important collective memories of Chinese society. It has often emerged in various literature, movies and drama, and has a deep and uncharacted humanistic meaning against Chinese society. In addition, due to the relationship between globalization, Chinese martial arts often appear in European and American movies and TV programs, and it is an important foot of Chinese culture by Europe and the United States.\n\nEverything in modern Chinese is talking about Chinese martial arts, often paying great attention to the philosophical spirit of it. Most people who love Chinese martial arts have attached importance to \"ethics and value of martial arts\", or called Wu De.\n\nTraditional martial arts, the first \"respecting teacher\", teach people to do good, practice martial arts purpose is to exercise the body, self-defeating, and then weaken, the safeguards.\n\nOften some people will quote \"Tang Ge as Wu\" to explain the humanistic spirit of Chinese martial arts. According to \"Zuo Chuan Xuan Gong Twelve Years\": \"Fuwen, Tengang is Wu Wu\", mostly said that China's Chinese characters \"Wu\", composed of two words \"stop\" and \"Goro\", thus interpreting The true value of \"Wu\" is not to kill damage, but for later peace. Although the source of \"Wu\" word is explained, for example, some people think that \"Tong\" \"toe\" is \"hand\", \"toe\" picking up \"Gao\" for the fight. But many people like to explain the part of the spirit of Chinese martial arts.\n\nRegardless of martial arts, novelists, movies, often emphasize the value of Chinese martial arts: \"Kung Fu is not used to fight, but use it as a strong body.\" When the martial artists learn the skill, it should be \"point until\", and should not be chaotic. The people who will, \"don't worry about the dryness\", you must \"quit the use of our urgent use\" because martial arts should not use active injuries, but should only \"as self-defense purposes when necessary.\" As for the country, when the country is in danger, it is the time when the husband is responsible.\n\nWe can sum up Chinese martial arts for the Chinese meaning, in:\n\nChinese martial arts, in China's modern and popular literature, movie works, and then derived from martial arts novels and action movies.\n\nIn these works, Chinese martial arts often have the following role:\n\nIn fact, people who write the above works often do not really understand Chinese martial arts. Some of the martial arts movements, the martial arts genre is the subject, and others refer to some legendary martial arts, and some are more martial arts content that creates Tiama. In fact, there are many martial arts (such as flying walls, point acupuncture, closing mountains, etc.) in various stories, are all tricks, but under the rendering of the story, these movements have been out of reality. It is far away.\n\nMany cultural analysis believes that this is reflecting the weakness and depression of modern people in society, making people seeking to overst the human body strength to defeat anxiety, and and mechanical civilizations in the real society. Chinese medicine, also known as Hanji, is a traditional medicine originated from Han Han and has now had a history of thousands of years [1]. Compared with modern Western medicine, it is often classified into traditional medicine. Therefore, today's development goals of traditional Chinese medicine are mostly pursuing their scientific and modernization.\n\nAccording to the nouns approved by the National Science and Technology Nouns Trial Committee, Traditional Chinese Medicine is \"the main body of traditional Chinese medicine is the main body, study the conversion of health and disease in human life activities and its prevention, diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation and health care. Comprehensive science [2]. In 2017, the first Chinese medicine law in mainland China was implemented [3].\n\nIn modern, general Chinese medicine refers to all national medicine and religious medicine within the scope of the Chinese nation. Such as Chinese medicine, Tibetan doctor, Mongolian doctor, Miao doctor, Dai doctor, medical doctor, Kazakh, Buddha doctor, etc .; narrow Chinese medicine, refers to Chinese medicine.\n\nThe word \"Chinese Medicine\", one is from Japan, one is from the name of the Qing Dynasty. [4] Also known as the Chinese medicine or Hanfang medicine, is a traditional medical thought and treatment technology developed in China because it is a traditional medical tradition that has developed in the Han nationality, so it is a Chinese medicine. With the development of Chinese culture, it is spread to South Korea, Vietnam, Japan, etc., combined with local medicine, forming a variety of different genres.\nThe nature of the \"Han Medical\" is Japan, in the Yangtze River Period, they use this noun to distinguish between \"Han Medical\", and Western Medicine - \"Lan Medicine\" (Netherlands). This noun is also used in the Qing Dynasty to call China's traditional medicine.\nBefore 1949, the term \"Chinese medicine was more common. In the Republic of China, also used national medicine. In China, \"Chinese Medicine\" (meaning \"China\" medicine) is more common than \"Han Medical\". However, this more neutral noun is still used in Japan and South Korea.\nJapan's Hanfang Medicine, South Korea's Korean Medicine, North Korea's Korean Medical Medicine, Vietnam's East Medicine is developed based on traditional Chinese medicine.\n\nChinese medicine uses yin and yang five elements as theoretical foundation, regards human body as a unity of gas, shape, god, through the method of hope, smell, ask, cut, four consultation, to explore cause, pathological, disease, analysis The machine and the change in the human body, the changes of meridian joints, gas-bloodation fluids, judge the evil and gain, and then derive the disease name, summarize the issuance, with the principle of syndrome differentiation, to develop \"sweat, spit, under, and, warm, clear, make , Eliminate the use of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture, hair, massage, massage, cupping, Qigong, diet, etc., so that the human body reaches yin yang and rehabilits. The active perspective of Chinese medicine treatment is that it can help restore the humans' yin and yang balance, and the negative surface is to use the drug to slow the deterioration of the disease, and can also take into account the quality of life and life [5]. In addition, the ultimate goal of Chinese medicine is not only to treat diseases, and further is to help human beings are close to the four models present in the \"Yellow Emperor\", namely, the realm of people, people, saints, and sages [6].\n\nIn recent years, the governments in various localities have begun to supervise the professional Chinese medicine industry to protect public health.\n\nThe Government of the People's Republic of China established the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine in 1988, which is a deputy national bureau affiliated to the Ministry of Health (the 2013 Health Department has revocated after the Safety Planning Commission).\n\nIn order to inherit and promote the development of traditional Chinese medicine, guarantee and promote the development of traditional Chinese medicine, protect the people's health, pass the \"People's Republican Chinese Medicine Law\" by the Twenty-five National People's Congress Standing Committee, on July 1, 2017 Implementation.\n\nChinese medicine does not legally practice medical practice during the Hong Kong-British period, but can register and conduct activities in the name of \"Herbalist\". Chinese medicine practitioners can also use \"Chinese Medicine\", \"Chinese Medicine\", \"Traditional Chinese Medicine\", \"National Medicine\", \"Tang Medical\", etc., can not use \"Doctor\", \"Physician\", Medical Center, \"Medical Center\" It belongs to the name of the medical scope, so the Chinese medicine practitioners have no right to sign a death certificate, and they cannot open any Western medicine on the prescription. Otherwise, it is considered to be illegal [7].\n\nThe Hong Kong Government established the Hong Kong Traditional Chinese Medicine Management Committee in 1999 to use the professional level of traditional Chinese medicine trading and Chinese medicine practitioners in 1999 to protect public health and consumer rights. According to the \"Traditional Chinese Medicine Regulations\", all Chinese medicine practitioners practicing in Hong Kong must register to the Chinese Medicine Management Committee. Before the registration system of the Chinese medicine teacher, in addition to providing the national medical treatment and the entrance to the practitioner who was named \"Chinese medicine\", there was later incorporated into the Chinese medicine registration system, when the common name \"Down Master\", \"fall Campaign. There is no unified saying that there is no unified statement, and there is a saying that is related to the wind of the martial arts in Hong Kong in the last century. [8] Later, due to the shortness of this industry, the \"Traditional Chinese Medicine Regulations\" and the implementation of the Chinese medicine registration system, regulatory activities or matters, including Chinese medicine, etc., and the Master has already It is incorporated into Chinese medicine, and people who have become a registered Chinese medicine (bone injury) must be approved and subjected to formal training, so old-fashioned museums have a gradual micro trend.\nRegistration procedures include: Completing the recognized five-year college Chinese medicine courses, gaining 30 weeks of clinical internship experience, through professional practitioners. [9] In addition, the Traditional Chinese Medicine Management Committee requested registration Chinese medicine practitioners, and the continued procedures were completed for 60 persistent cultivations every three years, and the continued training is completed to ensure the professional level of registered Chinese medicine practitioners. [10]\n\nThe colonial government in the Macaoogl is basically non-intervention in Chinese society, so many spontaneous spontaneous spontaneous organizers and Chinese medicine houses in Macau. In 1994, the Australian Government promulgated the \"Decree of No. 53/94 / M\", which officially regulated Chinese herbal medicine transactions. Macao sovereignty has been transferred to the SAR Government to supervise the Chinese medicine market [11]. In 2000, Macau University of Science and Technology and Nanjing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine colleges have established the Macao Academy of Chinese Medicine, which opened the course of learning of traditional Chinese medicine. [12].\n\nThere are currently more than 30,000 license acupuncturists (some states are called acupuncture physicians, and more than 5,000 Western physicians have access to acupuncture licenses. The United States has a strict acupuncture license issue system, but due to the implementation of the federal system, all states have local laws, and supervise the issuance of acupuncturer. Therefore, the requirements for the license issuance of each state are different, but the applicant is generally required to learn acupuncture or Chinese medicine schools approved by the US Higher Education Department. It is not equal to the 1700 to 4000, and the general requirements have 950 hours of clinical internship experience can be allowed to participate in the acupuncture license test. In addition, each state requires the holder of acupuncture licenses, and has renewed the acupuncture per year or every two years, otherwise its acupuncture license will be removed. The procedure of the acupuncture surplus, in addition to the update information, the acupuncture division also requested that acupuncturists provide evidence of continuous progress, and generally do dozens hours a year of professional continuous training courses can be renewed.\nThere is no valid license, but also claims to be professional acupuncturist, or providing Chinese medicine treatment is a criminal offense. The violations will face imprisonment and fines.\n\nUntil 2012, there were six stations in the United States without law supervision of traditional Chinese medicine, generally known as \"Oriental Medicine\" or \"Acupuncture\", including Alabama, Kansas, North Dakota, South Dakota State, Oklahoma, Wyoming. [13] In the state of law supervision of Chinese medicine, California is the first state legislative supervision \"acupuncture\" in the United States. In 1976, California has begun to issue professional licenses to acupuncturers [14].\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that \"Acupuncture\" or \"Acupuncturists\" or \"Acupuncturists\" or \"Acupuncturists\" or \"Acupuncturists\" is equivalent to \"Chinese Medicine\" and \"Chinese Medicine\". As an example of California, the first State Legislation Acupuncture, according to the \"Business and Professional Code\", \"Business and Professional Code\", \"Acupuncture\" refers to the improvement, maintaining and restoring health, and providing inhalation, Electricity, Chinese massage, acupoint massage, moxibustion, cupping, respiratory skills, exercise therapy, heat therapy, cold therapy, magnetic therapy, nutritional therapy, diet, herbal therapy, plant therapy, animal therapy, mineral therapy, Professionals such as dietary supplement therapy [15]. Therefore, the \"acupuncturist\" in the United States is \"Chinese Medicine\".\n\nDiet - Apparel - Architecture - Cultural Relics - Festival - Folk - Education\nScience - Five-Trim (Medical - Surgery) - Wushu\n\nWhether Chinese medicine is currently unable to determine the earliest traditional medicine. China's Chinese medicine claims to be active from the three emperors, and the vitalville invented acupuncture and tried herbs. Shennong Yan Emperor tasted hundreds of grass and detoxified it with tea. TCM researchers claimed that in more than 3,000 BC The earliest text found in the times), \"Medical books can be used in 3,000 years ago,\" in the current medical book \"is currently inconsistent with the facts compared to the non-free Chinese medicine. Mesopoamia Medicine in 3,000 BC has used wedge text to record the center of liver and dirty is the center of blood, and the disease is divided into fever, stroke, mental symptoms, eye diseases, ear disease, jaundice, etc. In China, after the \"Yellow Emperor Wishes\", the world has continuously added to the deletion, gradually forming the \"Yellow Emperor\" and \"Yellow Emperor\" and \"Yellow Emperor\", and the pure medical medicine will be separated from wish to the department. Later Chinese medicine. The \"Yellow Emperor's Internal Classics\" in the world proposed the prevention and health care in the disease and health care in the world. [Source Request]\nChina has established the world's first hospital and medical system in Zhou Dynasty (771 BC) China, and the medical institution of Zhou Dynasty has a physician, from the medical institution. (Tube Record), a few people. Here are four kinds of medical (tube diet), medical (internal medicine), ulcer (surgical), veterinarian; however, such medical distribution system is behind Mesopoamia Medicine for hundreds of years [16] . The medical administration of the doctor, and the doctor is appointed at the end of the year; \"Zhou Li Tianshi\" records \"year-end, then the killing of the medical, to make food\", that is, doctors must increase and decrease through the year-end assessment . The patients at the time have been treated, and the medical record is established. \"If the dead end, the book is, it is in the physician,\" stipulates that the death caused by the deceased medical record, and then sent to the physician to archive to summarize medical experience and improve medical technology. This is also known earliest medical record system.\n\nAt the Spring and Autumn Warring States (770 BC - the first 221 years), the famous medical doctor is a medical doctor, and the Qin State has a long mulberry and his apprentice. Bianque invented the unique syndrome differentiation of Chinese medicine, summed up as \"four diagnosis\" methods, namely \"hope, smell, ask, cut\". Bianque looks at the disease, the principle of \"six mysteria\": one is the power of relying on the power, the arrogance of the arrogance; the second is to be greedy money, no life; the third is overeating, the eating is not true; four is the depth of illness Does not rule; five is that the body is weak and can't take medicine; Sixth is to believe that witchcraft does not believe in medical treatment. After the world, he called him to bite his doctor. The main medical books in the Spring and Autumn Warring States have a \"Yellow Emperor's Internal\", \"Yellow Emperor\", \"Bian Dynasty\", \"Bai's Internal Classics\", \"Bai's Foreign\" and \"Next\" This seven, synthesized \"seven\".\n\nThe world's earliest forensic doctor in the world in the Qin Dynasty (221 BC)-\"History\". Qin Limo stipulates that the case of unknown causes must be carried out in principle, and the judiciary will be punished if the judiciary is not inspected. The \"diagnosis\" of the Qin Dynasty has a more detailed description of the method and procedures of forensic identification. In human mandarin cases, the main contents of the identification test include the position of the body, the part, the number, direction and the size of the wound. After the completion of the history of the history, a written report must be submitted, called \"\u7230\u4e66\", is the earliest foreurized forensic identification and on-site survey report in the world. The Qin Dynasty was also the first in the world to establish an infectious disease hospital - \"\u75a0 \u75a0 \u6240\", has developed an isolation system for the treatment of infectious diseases. According to 1975, Yunmeng sleep unearthed Qin Ji: At that time, the doctor found that there was a collapse of the nose, no sweat, hoarse, and stimulating the nasal cavity without sneezing, and stimulating the symptoms of the nasal cavity without sneezing. The treatment is separated from the mobility. This shows that the treatment measures for infectious diseases in ancient China have been effective.\n\nDuring the Western Han Dynasty (202 BC - 8 years AD), the yin and yang of Chinese medicine has been very complete, and the famous doctors have Taicang Gongyi and the public. The famous medical family Zhang Zhongjing and Hua Wei appeared in the Eastern Han. Zhang Zhongjing improved the dialectical theory of Chinese medicine. He is also the first clinical medicine master in the world, and is honored to be a doctor. He has a medical book such as \"Winning Writing\", \"Medick Women\", \"Dangu Fang\", \"Dentory\", \"Phase\", and finally circulating the medical books, the medical books, were compiled as \"typhisticalism\" and \"\u91d1\u532e \u8981\". Zhang Zhongjing adopts the basic principles of syndrome differentiation. In the \"Treatise on Talete\", Zhang Zhongzhi is \"eight-way syndrome differentiation\" and \"six-class\". After the treatment of these two methods, the \"eight law\" (sweat, spit, under, and , Temperature, clear, supplement, and eliminate the treatment of diseases. \"Ozang Disease Difference\" is the specific principle of implementing the identification of differentiation, the so-called \"eight\" (yin, yang, table, inherent, cold, hot, virtual, real) is the use of \"four diagnosis\" (expect, smell, ask, cut, cut ) Analysis and examination of the part of the disease, the nature summarizes, \"Six Six\" is a specific application of the whole visceral and meridian. At the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty, Hua Wei took the world with proficiency surgery and anesthesia, Hua Wei is the first person in the world. The number of surgical surgery in the world. He invented the amorrage is the world's best anesthetic drug, but also founded The world's earliest fitness gymnastics \"five birds\". Unfortunately, the \"Green Book\" of the medical book of Hua Wei was finally paid. In the Han Dynasty, a large number of medicines and theories were introduced to Tibet (\"Tibet Wang Dynasty\" records). In the Han Dynasty, there were also special gynecological hospitals, and the \"Male\" in the Western Han Dynasty was the world's best in the world.\n\nDuring the Nort-North Dynasties (420-1589), the world's earliest two pediatric monographs, namely the \"children's use of drugs\" and Xu Shuyu's \"Medicine Hundred Diseases\". In the Southern Dynasties, Song Yuanjia was twenty years (AD 443), the Tai Medical Monitor made Qin Chengzu created the world's first medical school. In the 6th century AD, Sui Dynasty improved the medical education institution and was named \"Tai Medical Services\". The department is divided into medical, the drug is two, the doctor's order is the highest official position, the assistant, the subject, the doctor, Pharmacist, Doctor, Dr. Taoist, Massage, Wishing Dr. Bai, a lot of teachers and students in schools, more than 580 people.\n\nIn the Northern Song Dynasty, with the high development of trade between China and the Arab, Arabian incense has also begun to enter China. Arabian milky in China is actually taken by 10,000 pounds, and Islamics also have a significant impact on China. Traditional Chinese medicine is self-reliant During the Northern Song During the Northern Song Dynasty, the Tai Hospital was also divided into 13 countries such as ancient Greece and Arabic medicine. This may be a horizontal impact of Arabic-Islamic medicine. Traditional Chinese medicine is dominated by soup, but the \"Taiping Sheng Hui Fang\" in the Northern Song Dynasty, \"Shengji Purchase\" has increased a lot of prescriptions of pills, scatters, paste, and, such as \"milk sun\", \"Aweyuan\". The reason is, it is to use a lot of absorbers from the import of Arab-Islamic countries, and the detachment contains volatile substances. If the frying is used, its effective ingredient will lose, so it can only be made into a pill, scattered, paste . It can be seen that the appearance of this type of prescription is the result of the impact of Arabic-Islamic pharmacology to traditional Chinese medicine [17].\n\nIn the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907), Sun Sizhen summed up the theory of the predecessors and summed up experience, collecting more than 5,000 drugs, published \"Daily Medical Sincere\", \"Qianjin Forum\" and \"Qianjin Wing Party\" three The medical book, the next generation, said that he is a king. After the Tang Dynasty, China's medical theory and books were rumored to Turkic, Gao Ji, Japan, Central Asia, West Asia.\n\nAt the end of the Tang Dynasty, the pediatrics were \"cranioted\", and the first famous pediatric expert money in the history of the world's medical history (AD 1032-113) was inspired by this book, and the famous pediatric master is written. \" Direct drug certificate, the future generations, called Qian Yi as \"Sheng Shu\", \"The Nasal Ancestor of the Young\". In the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127), the Song government set up the Hanlin Medical College, the Thai Medical Bureau, and the medical science has been very complete, and the Chinese acupuncture acupoints are unified, publish \"map\". Song Ci in the Southern Song Dynasty published the world's earliest forensic book \"washing collection\".\n\nDuring the Yuan Dynasty, the Yuan government attached great importance to Islamine, adopting Chinese medicine and back to medical policies. In Taiyuan, there is a \"Guanghui\" specializing in the use of Islamic medicine. Its duty is \"Application for returning to drugs and agents, with the treatment of the guards and shanas in Beijing.\" It also has most of them. Return to the pharmacology and go back to the pharmacology, pay back (Muslim) medicine. In the Yuan Dynasty, there are a lot of Arabi-Islamic physicians to China, which is welcomed by the Dynasty, known as \"Back to the Doctor\". They have a research on anatomy and proficient in various surgery. In the ended behalf of the famous literary, the \"Nanyun Tilm\" volume of Tao Zongyi's \"Nanyuan Dairy\", in the Western Western Medicine, there is a child who has returned to the doctor to take a headache to remove the tumor from the brain. The surgery is inflated. Legendary story in Malaysia. These medical practitioners also bring a lot of Islamic medical books [17].\n\nIn the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), the famous medical master Li Shizhen's medical masterpiece \"The Materia Medica\" is not only a pharmaceutical monograph, but also the knowledge of botany, zoology, mineralogics, chemistry. \"Materia Medica\" was quickly passed on as asia, North Korea, and Vietnam, which were translated into a variety of European languages \u200b\u200bin the 17th and 18th centuries. On the other hand, Li Shizhen is the first in the world to put forward the brain's mental feeling, and find gallstocks, and use ice to reduce high-fever patients to cool down and inventive medical practitioners. In addition, there is Wang Shuhe's \"pulse\", Huang Yi's \"acupuncture\", Tao Hongjing's \"Pharaoa intensive\", Ge Hong's \"Emergency\", Nest Yuan's \"Source Waiting\", Su Jing \"New Repair Materia Medica\", Wang Hao's \"Outer Secret\", Yuan Dan Gub's \"Four Medical Draft\", \"Taiping Sheng Hui Fang\", Wang Weiyi's \"Copper Host Acupuncture Turan\" and other large number of medical clauses come out. Self-cultivation has reached its peak, and there are many medical geography. At the same time, the so-called Eastern Medicine in the Korean research in North Korea has also been greatly developed. For example, Xu Wei wrote \"Dongxian Bao Jian\".\n\nDuring the Qing Dynasty, the pharmaceutical progress was shown in many ways, which was basically the continuation of the Ming Dynasty Medicine. If the study of classics, this histology, prescription, diagnosis and treatment, medical case finish, etc., are more mature than the Ming Dynasty. The disputes between each school have also gradually ease. Most doctors can pick up all their families in clinical. But there is no lack of insightful \"internal\", \"difficult\", \"typhisthetism\", and criticize all new medicine after the Jinyuan, this is not related to the presence of the test [18]. The most important achievements of Chinese medicine pharmacy in the Qing Dynasty are about acute infectious diseases. It has formed a new system, namely temperature pathology. The appearance of this student, although it is based on the achievements of the Chinese doctor, the contribution of the Qing Dynasty temperature sick school in the history of TCM, is still quite obvious, it is not a \"typhisticalism\", Jin Dynasty Liu Yuen's school school [18].\n\nSince the end of the Qing Dynasty, modern medicine [19] began in China, seriously impacted the development of Chinese medicine. Starting a situation in China and Western medicine. Modern, Chinese medicine is still one of the common means of treating disease in China.\n\nAfter being impacted by the West, most believes that Chinese medicine is a prefaciated medicine, but in the 1950s, Traditional Chinese medicine began to introduce Western medicine research systems, and re-explained Chinese medicine through scientific analysis of the principles of the course, but so systematically The finishing, imported Western organism, molecular medicine, etc. have achieved modern Chinese medicine, from empty yin and yang, and changed to the focus of learning.\n\nAs a part of Chinese medicine acupuncture as traditional Chinese medicine, there is an interest in the medical community. Some scholars believe that acupuncture has been confirmed to reduce the pain after surgery, the nausea and vomiting produced by anti-stomach during pregnancy, and tooth pain is effective. And its side effect is very low, acupuncture is very significant, and the efficacy of neurological diseases is very significant. [20]. The World Health Organization (Abb: WHO) believes that only some of the traditional pharmaceutical contained acupuncture and herbs are more powerful results in clinical experiments, other traditional medications and herbs still need further research, and cannot ignore traditional therapies. The risk of safety and danger, even to poke a medicinal material, and the anesthetic, toxin accumulation in the biology has been gradually discovered that it is proven to be able to make it awkward, so that the case of death has been staged many times. Because it is the underground economy, there is a problem of pretending to get a fake medicine [21]. WHO issued \"2002-2005 Traditional Medicine Research Global Strategy on May 26, 2002\", inviting 180 countries in the world to incorporate medical policies in the country.\n\nThe WHO World Health Assembly will launch the 11th Edition Global Medical Outline in 2019, and the traditional Chinese medicine is included in it. This means that Chinese medicine is in the world or among the mainstream therapies, not only supplementary therapies other than surgery, radiotherapy, etc.\nThe global medical outline is also known as \"statistical classification of international diseases and related health issues\" (ICD), which has great influence in a global scale. [twenty two]\n\nThe theory of Chinese medicine can be divided into three periods in accordance with its theoretical foundation, respectively, and the Tournament is still in the period of the book, and the ancient Chinese book.\nOur mainstream society today is the \"Yellow Emperor's Internal Classics\" representatives represented by this book. Han Wudi's postgraduated three passers-by, promoting this literature. Later, the Emperor of Han Dynasty won the son of Han Jing Emperor Liu Yu bad, and the ancient text of the Lecix is \u200b\u200blater. In short: \"Ancient Wen Shangshu\" and the emergence of \"this article\" are related to the Han Dynasty. After the Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, the soup liquid was hidden in the folk, and only this scriptor was circulated. In the early twentieth century, \"the anti-medicine treatment of the auxiliary medicine\" is unearthed. Recently discovered the basic theory of the soup through the law. In the timing, the soup liquid is earlier, followed by this book, the book and ancient book, and Xu Shen mentioned \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" Yan Song's Note \"Three Kingdoms \u00b7 Wu Zhi\" is called \"This article\", this is \"a\" hear \", misunderstanding text.) Ouyang said, liver, wood; heart, fire; spleen, earth; lung, gold Also; kidney, water is also. Ancient \"Shangshu\" said that spleen, wood is also; lung, fire is also; heart, earth, liver, gold also; kidney, water also. Xu Shen case, \"month\" Spring Festival, summer Sacrifies the lungs, the summer, the autumn festival, the winter, the winter, the kidney, the ancient \"Shangshu\" is the same. Zheng Hui Yun: \"Month Order\" offers four times, and its five hidden ears. Winter is in winter After, and the kidney is under; the summer is in front, and the lungs are on; the spring is small, the sacrifice is the first spleen; the autumn is small, so the sacrifice is also a liver. The kidney is also, the spleen is also, the \u9b32; lung, The heart is also, the liver is also awkward. The sacrifice will be three, so there is a first-minded, there is no way to be the same as the five elements. Today's medical disease, the liver is wood, the heart is fire, the spleen is the soil, the lungs are gold, The kidney is water, there is also a jealous. If the anti-its surgery, it is not dead as a drama. (\"Book\" 13 \"month\" justice) \"The ancient Wen Shangshu is passed by Fusheng, and this article is passed by Ouyang and Bo. Clinical experiments have proven that the soup liquid is consistent with the human fluid taste of the human body.\nThis proves that the popular Chinese medicine theory foundation is actually the book of this euro, and the five elements say that it is in Qi, the Warring States Period, and the five elements are said to be Liu Xiang period, so the perfect Huangdi internal completion time It is impossible to earlier than the Han Xuan Emperor. Later, the soup liquid was used to refer to the fairy home. It adopts this famous book called the medical home or called the needle, using this famous book and soup liquid to be called the manuscript.\nThe following is a comparison of three different Chinese traditional Chinese medicine theories:\n\nAmong the original Chinese medicine theories in the \"Soup Solve Dynasties\", it is a total of 16 gossip in the \"Turtle\" gossip and \"Dragon Map\" in the Yin Shang period. Where is the place where the yin and yang is the opposite. In the \"soup liquid\" or Yin Shang orthodox philosophy: spring and summer is Yin, autumn and winter is Yang. Take the lungs, the sun is in the sun, and the spleen is small and the fire, and the liver is hurting less. Should be 4: Spring pulse, summer, autumn, winter sink.\n\nThe theory of this literary school is from the summary of Confucianism and the literary school and the five elements of Confucian Yinyang. Its content includes essentials, yin and yang five-way learning, gas-blood, Tibetan, meridians, physical fitness, cause, pathogenesis, pathogenesis, rules, health, etc. Not earlier than the Western Han Dynasty, the \"Yellow Emperor\" came out, laid the foundation of Confucian medical theory. Today, the traditional Chinese medicine related theory, diagnostic method, treatment method, etc. can be found in this book.\n\nThe traditional Chinese medicine has a complete Confucian theoretical system, and its unique place is that Dong Zhongshu proposed, \"Heaven and Man\", \"Heaven and Man\", \"Tianshi\". The main features are:\n\nThe five elements said that it is an important achievement in the Warring States Confucian philosophy, five lines, fire, soil, gold, water, but this does not represent five substances, but the five properties of the substance.\n\nThe five lines of Chinese medicine reflect the relationship between the five major systems of these five attributes. The five symbols of the wood fire soil gold represent the five major systems leading to liver, heart, spleen, lung and kidney. Chinese medicine is not studying how micro virus bacteria acts on the theory of the human body, but to study the relationship between the overall environment of the human body and the various systems, and adjust the balance between the systems through Chinese medicine, massage, acupuncture, and even psychological effects to adjust the balance between the systems. This keeps your health.\n\nThe \"Decoction of the Decoction\" is a Chinese medicine school heard since Yin Shang, and the party representative [24]. This set of theory is a considerable difference between the Confucian derived version of the art. For example, there is no five-way theory in the \"Soup Solver Law\" school, using a sixteenth to learn, and among the Yinyang is against this literary call. The following theoretical restore is from Hong Kong's historian Chen Zhenming, \"by\" the internal medicine of the medicine \"to\" to Hong Kong's contemporary new ejection \". [25]\n\nThe \"Decoction of the Decoction\" school is based on the \"immediate measurement\", and the length of the sun is the sun, the sun is short of Yin.\n\nDeduced:\n\nLi Chun is a yinkun, and the spring is divided into less yin.\n\nListeak is the Yangtze Sky, summer solstice is too yin.\n\nLi Qiu is the sun of Shaoyang, and the autumn is divided into Shaoyang.\n\nEstablish winter is the yin of the sun, and the winter solstice is dry for the sun.\n\nSpring weather, summer heat, autumn cool, winter temperate.\nSpring is a small thermal fire, summer is too hot, autumn is less Yangliang, winter is the sun.\n\nSpring, summer, autumn, winter sink.\n\nFour positive, spleen and liver and kidney.\nSiki, stomach heart.\n\nThe south is the dragon, the north is phoenix, the East is a turtle, and the West is Lin.\n\nSpring Gold is the spleen and stomach, the summer wood is the pulmonary heart, autumn water is the hepatic gallbladder, and the winter is the kidney intestine.\n\nLi Chun is the stomach gold, color white Kun.\nSpring is spleen, color yellow.\nLixia is a heart, color green.\nSummer to the lung wood, color green earthquake.\nLiqiu is bile water, black dry.\nAutumn is a liver water, color blue.\nThe winter is the intestinal fire, and the color is red.\nWinter solstice for kidney fire, coloring red cream.\n\nChunjin is the spleen, the summer wood is lung, autumn water is liver, and the winter is kidney.\nThe taste is a wood, the taste is a fire, the taste is gold, the taste is a water.\n\nPulmonary main gas, kidney blood, spleen, liver maintenance.\n\nThe lungs are hi, the spleen is angry, the liver is worried, the kidney is fear.\n\nWhen diagnosing the treatment of disease, take the method, symptoms, and signs of the four diagnosis, smell, ask, cut four consultations, symptoms, and signs of disease, nature, part, and evil Relationship, summarization, determination as a \"certificate\" of a certain nature, to explore the essence of the disease, thereby concluding, and determines the treatment principles and specific governance. This method is different from simple local symptomatic treatment, and is different from non-division, inseparable, no nature, one, one, a disease, a disease.\n\nThe treatment means and methods are rich in many, including general inner medicines, there are external treatment, hot iron, fumigation, etc., and unique acupuncture, cupping, massage, massage, Qigong, cloth, etc. Drug therapy, and daily food therapy represented by medicated diet.\n\nIn general, the complete Chinese medicine prescription, at least four or more: emotion (emotional control) guidance; taboo (diet should pay attention); sports advice (swimming, running, guiding, Qigong, etc.); Chinese medicine Use, or acupuncture, moxibustion (formerly agreed with acupuncture), massage, etc. Therefore, in the treatment of diseases, Chinese medicine is a full consideration with the angle of mind and mental.\n\nA number of traditional drug injection preparations have been emerged in recent years, which are used for muscles and intravenous injection. In addition, most drugs are naturally movable, planted, minerals, non-artificial synthetic chemicals, plus more compound preparations, and the corresponding antagonistic measures can be employed.\n\nCompared to traditional Chinese medicine, the inventions of modern Chinese medicine practitioners include small needles, traditional drug injection preparations, scientific Chinese medicine, etc.\n\nFrom the weeks, there are foods, disease doctors, ulcer, veterinary deposits. The Tai Medical Department of the Sui and Tang Dynasties is divided into medical and pharmaceutical, medical, medical, joys, massage, curse; medical treatment, small, small, sore, ear-top-ended, angle, etc. Song Taishang's medical education initial square, needle, ulcertia, Song Shenzong, divided into nine sects, namely, the fondang, small veins, Fengke, obstetric, ophthalmology, tetrey, sore throat, sore and survival\u79d1, \u9488 and moxibustion, Jin Yu and Branch. Yuan Tai Hospital is divided into ten sects and is 10 disciplines: that is, the generic medicine department, small ceremonial department, Fengke, obstetric and women's miscellaneous, ophthalmology, tenthopharyngology, orthodynum , Acupuncture and Division, I wish you all the best. The Ming Tai Hospital is divided into thirteen: the big square, the small veins, women, typhoid fever, sore, denture, throat, bone, golden, eye, acupuncture, massage, and wish. Qingyai Hospital's first eleven sects, and then the nine sects: the large square, small, women, typhoid fever, sore, oral teeth, orthose, eye, acupuncture. Dao Guang two years (1822): \"It is advisable to do the\" need to pierculate the fire and moxity \", and the Tai Hospital will abolish the acupuncture department. Tongzhi will , Woman, typhoon and is a department, so only five subjects.\n\nThe ancient Chinese medicine is divided into internal medicine, foreign medicine.\n\nModern Chinese medicine can be divided into basic medicine and clinical medicine\n\nChinese medicine is divided into medical treatment, medical treatment, grass, medical, medical case, medical treatment, etc., such as \"Yellow Emperor\", \"It's a Treaty\", \"Golden Chambers\", \"Shennong Herb\" , \"Multi-gold\", \"Compendium of Materia Medica\", \"Name Medical Case\".\n\nIn \"Han Shu, Yi Wenzhi\", divide the doctor into the \"medical\", \"party\", \"god\", \"housing\" four geography. Since the development, it can be divided into eight geography: the tattoory school, the rivers, the Yi water school, the attacking, the Danxi school, the temperature supplement, the temperature sick school, the Chinese and Western Huitong School.\n\nFrom ancient times, well-known and legendary Chinese medicine practitioners: (See: List of Chinese Medicine)\n\n\u5c90 \u4f2f,, Zhang Zhongjing, Hua Wei, Wang Shuhe, Tao Hongjing, Sun Sizhen, Song Ci, Liu Yu, Zhang Zi Zheng, Li Wei, Zhu Zhenheng, Zhang Jingyue, Fu Mountain, Ye Gui, Chen Xiuyuan, Cao Ying, Yu Shu, Tang Rongchuan, Qin Bo , Zhang Qiangong, Zhao Shaoqin, Zhang Jizhai, Shi Xiangxu, Chengmen Xue, Pu Fu Zhou, Zuoji Yun, Zheng Shouquan, talking about Yixian, etc.\n\nSince modern medical (also known as Western medicine), with missionary, the competition and integration of the two medical systems have been in progress.\n\nThe medical system in the world can be roughly divided:\n\n\"Plavidism Medical System\" (Theology): It is believed that the occurrence of disease is due to the strength of the supernatural (Shen Ling), such as Satan, Ghost, God, Witch Doctor, Children, Curse, etc.\n\n\"Nature Medical System\" (experienced medicine): Think the disease occurs due to changes in the natural environment or causes abnormal lifestyle, such as changes in climate, eating habits, human emotional changes. Chinese medicine, life spending vs., homeopathic, etc. belong to this class.\n\n\"Scientific Medicine System\" (experimental design): It is the mainstream of modern medicine, such as the medical instrument detection, or the medical instrument detection, or the medical instrument detection.\n\nThe front two are classified as traditional medicine or alternative medicine, while the latter is the mainstream of modern medicine.\n\nThese three types of medicine have essentially the difference in the understanding of the world, and the bottom concept is different, so it is basically unable to communicate between each other:\n\nIn the world of \"Plavidism Medicine\", people are inferior, all the truth, the mystery of the universe is to master the mysterious power in the unable to specifically, and humans want to have a certain period, can only ask this unable to control my mysterious power. .\n\nIn the world of \"Nature Medicine\", people are at your own risk, think that the universe runs in the simple principle, the principle is universal, and all the mystery of the human body also follows. As long as the principle is grasped, all problems in the world can analyze and solve, and medicine is no exception. And it is considered that the principle has been found, and people only need to follow the execution, they can solve any problems.\n\nIn the world of \"scientificism\", people are not humble, and empirical empirics for objective world is the only standard. If the operation of things is objective and regular, people can attribute organisms through experience, logic, and empirical ways, to grasp the law and obtain the ability to deal with certain problems.\n\nTCM diagnosis disease is the result of understanding the destruction, but there is also a diagnosis of illnesses (such as emergency or special illnesses), or only discreating, illness (for example, unknown diseases , Incurable diseases, or conditioning the body, etc.). Different from modern medicine on \"disease\" in diagnosis, Chinese medicine often emphasizes \"dismissal (symptoms).\"\n\nTaking a cold as an example, the modern medical physician will distinguish between viral or bacterial infection, which will identify the upper respiratory tract infection or combined with pneumonia; but these diagnostics are not most important to Chinese medicine practitioners. With the point of view of Chinese medicine, it is necessary to distinguish it. This is a cold or wind hot; if it is a cold, it is a solar disease, Yangming or less state of sickness; which stage of the disease is from the blood of the disease Wait.\n\nTraditional Chinese medicine mainly passes traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture and other treatment methods, helping the human body to drive evil spirits and restore normal gas. Its thinking can be simply two categories, depending on the condition, the attack or supplement, or the attack. Traditionally, clinical attacks have eight methods, namely \"sweating, spit, lower, and warm, clear, fill, elimination\", called eight methods.\n\nOne of the value of Chinese medicine is that the prescription is the experience of the doctor. The process of the development of Chinese medicine itself is the experimental medicine, especially for hundreds of years after numerous doctors, and even the clinical human experiment of the millennium has confirmed the actual effective and recorded scriptures. Directly facing the disease, master the main symptoms, select the symptomatic prescription to reduce or subtraction, not in theory, to treat disease, this is the original face of Chinese medicine.\n\nModern Chinese medicine also has the use of Chinese and Western medicine combined treatment, especially in mainland China, using modern medical testing methods to assist in diagnosis, Chinese medicine practitioners can use traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine for patient treatment.\n\nIn the Chinese cultural circle, some patients usually have diseases such as unknown diseases, chronic diseases, and causes such as unknown disease, or because of the development of modern medicine, or the medical resource that the patient can obtain, there is no treatment Will help to the Chinese medicine. But most people have helped modern medicine in surgery, and frequent patients with rapid lesions.\n\nA disease may be cured, and how much the probability is, which has a clear statistical number in modern medicine than in traditional Chinese medicine.\n\nTraditionally, Chinese medicine judges the efficacy by changes in pulse and patient taking drugs. Some Chinese medicine believe that Chinese medicine is difficult to conduct comparison, but modern research on Chinese medicine, and establish a variety of experimental animal models or enters clinical human experiments, compare the test, to verify the efficacy of Chinese medicine or Chinese medicine.\n\nModern medicine treatment methods and agents are to confirm the effects through scientific contrast tests (such as using placebo contrast).\n\nIn recent years, in Taiwan, all major teaching hospitals or regional hospitals are generally opened, and the Ministry of Traditional Chinese Medicine is opened and the task of clinical trials in traditional Chinese medicine. For example, \"Supresses, III, III, September 24th, 2006,\" Seminar \", Director Yang Xianhong, director of the North District of Chang Gung Hospital, issued\" Xinyi Treatment of allergic rhinitis random double-blind clinical effect evaluation \" In a two-year double-blind experiment, a total of 108 patients were collected, and 60 of the total experiment were completed, including 40 experimental groups, 20 control groups, and for clinical symptoms, nasal resistance, nasal cross-sectional area, dust Statistical analysis of various indicators such as secretion of mites specific immunoglobulin and T lymphocyte hormone. The results showed that Xinyi tuned patients with patients with allergic rhinitis have clinical efficacy. The machine transition of this efficacy includes the immunoassay of T cells and the effects of neutrophil activity [26]. This is one of the many scientific research proof of traditional Chinese medicine science and its medical value. Other representative Chinese medicine research verification results also recorded public and detailed records in the website of the Chinese Academy of Health Department of Sanhua Medicine Committee [27], providing interesters to see Chinese medicine and clinical results.\n\nMost of the books of Chinese medicine in ancient times, such as the \"Yellow Emperor\" in the Warring States Period, Eastern Han Dynasty \"Treatys\", the Ming Dynasty's \"Materia Medica\", using the gentle words, and the song, the song, the song is not easy to understand, and Increase the difficulty of propagation. Ancient Chinese officials have also continued to collect all kinds of traditional Chinese medicine books, become a special medical book, and have an examination system, and in the private manner inheritance. In modern times, it is established in TCM or college, and the system is organized, studied, teaching, and in the private man, also retains some of the divisions and home transmission methods.\n\nA very different place in traditional Chinese medicine and modern medicine is the experience of Chinese medicine attention to the ancients. Chinese medicine practitioners promote the ancient Chinese medical books, and the opposite of modern medicine has also focused on medical development.\n\nModern medicine continues to introduce new and open new drugs. On the one hand, the Chinese medicine specializes in the ancient secret recipe, the medical book, and the collections, and adopts, from the ancient people, and continue to be reviewed and used, on the other hand, it is constantly based on the party or time, for different diseases in the clinic The addition and decrease is carried out, develop new prescriptions, or by changing the dosage form, such as a traditional Chinese medicine injection preparation, to expand the treatment range of the prescription or enhance its efficacy.\n\nModern medicine is based on the knowledge system of the text, if a treatment or the drug is not or effective, this knowledge can quickly spread. Modern use of network and dissemination media, as well as the establishment of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the establishment of Chinese Medicine Research Institute, various examples of traditional Chinese medicine also gradually spread.\n\nGenerally speaking [who? Experienced old Chinese medicine medical skills, experience has a significant decisive role in the effect. Due to the disturbance of Chinese medicine, the vocabulary of Chinese philosophy in Chinese philosophy is to make it difficult for experience. In the Chinese medicine classics such as medical, this grass, medical case, and medical treatment, all kinds of prescriptions, Chinese medicine use timing, artillery method, use taboo, side effects, symptoms and treatment methods, such as Qing Chen Xiuyuan's annotation of \"Shen Nong Hard Medicine Read\" Volume 4, \"Today, I am confused by money, Biki Pulmonary geka, use (Maota Bell) to treat the falseness, hundreds of people .\n\nIn China, whether there is a scientific problem in Chinese medicine, it has always been arguing. The controversy of the academia dates back to the end of the 19th century, and some people who advocate medical modernization after modern medicine, and advocated abolishing Chinese medicine, and traditional Chinese medicine was challenged. Until today, whether Chinese medicine is in science, and whether Chinese medicine is effective, etc., remains doubled by the mainstream scientific community [28].\n\nSince the European medicine Dongchuan, the Chinese medicine is scientific and the dispute is extremely large [29].\n\nIn 1879, Yu Wei issued the \"waste medicine\" first put forward the claims to abolish traditional Chinese medicine. In 1915, Yuan Guisheng, Jiangsu, the \"Waste 5\" as a proposal to share the Shenzhou Medical Association, entitled \"proposed to scrapped five proposal\" [30]. According to the medical semi-column, it may be the earliest article to abolish the two-line theory.\n\nIn 1926, Lu Xun once wrote \"father's disease (page archive backup, existed in Internet Archive), and criticized some problems in Chinese medicine.\n\nIn 1929, the National Government passed the \"abolition of old doctors to remove medical health care\" proposed by Yu Yunzhen. However, under the pressure of public opinion in the country, the National Government subsequently recovered the life [31].\n\nIn 2005, Professor Zhang Gong Yao, Central South University, published \"Say Bifidi Chinese Medicine\" in \"Medical and Philosophical\" magazine.\n\nChina's official statement believes that Chinese medicine is a science. In response to Chinese medicine unscientific, Jing Zhiwei believes that \"November 19, 2005, the country changed its name to the Chinese Traditional Chinese Medicine\", which is also a return on these arguments. \"[32] Dong Jian Dong believes\" in modern scientific demultiplexing Standards are in non-sciences, and they are different from pseudo science \"[33]. Sun Xuegang, etc., considers according to the scientific demociation standards in Said, and \"can't say Chinese medicine is a science\" [34].\n\nThere are still some people believe that Chinese medicine stems from the ancient people's sensibility and sensory understanding of the law of human body and nature, its nature is not narrow science (but can use appropriate modern scientific methods to research and play some Chinese medicine theories), but it has super off One side of science. And \"not scientific\" cannot deny the efficacy of TCM therapy. If there is, we will have a lot of valuable cultural assets [35] [36] [37].\n\nOthers, such as Fang Zhouzi, think that the efficacy of TCM claims is also worthy of suspicion [38]. The effects of placebo and human autologous immunity cannot be excluded because there is no support recognized by modern medicine. And he pointed out that some Chinese medicine believers have more ridiculous mistakes, and many Chinese medicine is not from clinical experience, but from the fetching witchcraft thinking. [39]\n\nCurrently, many scientific media, if shells, cloves, doctor [40], etc., and many science authors and some netizens, they also hold a position on Chinese medicine. Such as negative the theoretical significance and efficacy of Chinese medicine, or advocates the abolition of the theory of traditional Chinese medicine and use modern scientific methods to inspect and explain some of the treatment techniques or drugs of traditional Chinese medicine (referred to as \"waste medicine for drug administration).\n\nIn 2019, Hong Kong's historian Chen Zhenming was in the \"secondary medicine to use medicine\" to Hong Kong contemporary new economics [25]\nIt is pointed out the source of Confucian political philosophy of yin and yang, and the contents of \"The Soup Solid Skulls\" is restored to the \"Decoction of Decoction\" and derived the \"Yellow Emperor's Internal Classics\" and Yin and Yang Five Theory as the Basic Theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine.\n\nIn 1929, at a failed attempt to abolish the Chinese medicine, the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Pharmaceutist was established as \"Chinese National Medical Festival\" on March 17, in order to celebrate this victory. This is a holiday related to Chinese medicine.\n\n\nChinese medicine Calligraphy is a method of writing text, a writing art. The calligraphy is longitudinally penetrating two levels: \"Use\" and \"Aesthetics\"; horizontal crossword two levels: \"text\", \"painting\". Calligraphy is a tool for studying writing writers in addition to the main performance and work of Calligraphy home, is also a tool for studying a mentality and character of writing. All local areas have their own calligraphy characteristics in terms of historical and cultural development, and calligraphy is still widely used in life and art culture.\n\nThe definition of contemporary calligraphy:\n\nThe typical concept of East Asian calligraphy is \"ink, holding a brush, writing Chinese characters, and the lines of the lines disclosed in the line. Calligraphy is considered an important art and the most elegant writing form of East Asia. Writing Chinese characters has always been a kind of literacy. It is derived from Chinese calligraphy, respectful by the East Asian civilization society and is widely practiced, including: China, Japan, Vietnam, North Korea.\nChinese characters calligraphy is the most typical representative in East Asian calligraphy. It is also the collective of East Asian calligraphy. Because most of the fonts are mostly Chinese characters, all East Asian calligraphy is also the earliest passed by China.\n\nIn addition to the traditional cultural four treasures, the rise of hard pen calligraphy is more hardware due to the innovation of writing tools.\n\nMongolian calligraphy is Mongolian calligraphy, similar to East Asian calligraphy, Mongolian calligraphy mainly writes into [4]. Mongolian calligraphy uses traditional Mongolian letters, in 2013, Mongolian calligraphy column named represented in the human non-material cultural heritage representative [5].\n\nNepalese calligraphy is mainly written by Lanzu, which is in Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, such as Lanydza Script, Phagpa Script or Kutila. , Listed, Mongolia, China coast, Japan and South Korea, using the Buddhist scriptures of six words or other derived from Sanskrit or Bali.\n\nThai calligraphy is mainly written in Sanskrit. In history, Thai calligraphy is restricted in the classic sacred text of Bli. The Thai Scriptures appear in the personal banner of Royal Thai members, and the first name will be expressed in Thai calligraphy. Some books have also been printed with a combination of Thai calligraphy.\n\nTibet is part of the Indian cultural circle. It has been a Buddhist heart zone for hundreds of years. Tibetan words originated from Indian text, and its text is very important in religious districts, and Tibetan calligraphy is an important culture. Tibet's aristocrats such as Lama and Pudla Palace are usually good at calligraphy. There are not many parts related to the classic calligraphy, but there is indeed (and some degree is also related to Tibetan Buddhism). Almost all of the documents written by all religious seniors are related to Tibetan calligraphy, including the letter sent by the Dalai Lama, as well as other religious circles and secular seniors. Tibetan calligraphy is particularly obvious on its transferred columns, but these texts are forged, not scratched. Tibetan calligraphy is the earliest use of reed pen, now it is also written in a pointer.\n\nWestern calligraphy is different from traditional East Asian calligraphy. Western calligraphy is rarely written by a brush, but written with a hard pen and paper, and the most famous pen is a goose brush. The early letters were invented about 3,000 years ago. From the Greek letters to Latin letters, the uppercase is developed first, and then the lowercase is developed.\n\nThe first batch of Romans appeared. This batch has only a few folds, and it is done with parchment, and the reed pen is replaced by the Goose Brush. Christian Beliefs will help Western calligraphy development at this time. Because this copy of the Bible and other holy books are very popular. In Ireland, the monks have used Anstale in the past. In Scotland and elsewhere, you will be called this writing method with the \"Island Style\", which is also a full day of mud gold decoration hand.\n\nCharlium then brings the drama to Western calligraphy. He appointed Alqi, the Dean of York Monastery, Alqin came to Charcheman's capital Aachen, and brought the responsibility of all textures. He then also developed new handwriters for Charman's Emperor and named Carlin Grass Book.\n\nGothic letters then appeared in the 11th century, although the letters were not popular, but the name similar to the names became the mainstream of the late Chinese calligraphy. It also has a Dafa Officer (English: CHANCERY HAND) (CHANCERY HAND) and Italian handwritten. At this time, mud gold decorative handwritten fonts have also been affected, so it is prevalent. However, after 15 centuries, John Gitanburg invented the orthodontics that made handwritten and hand-decorated books quickly, but Western calligraphy did not disappear.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, William Morris and other people of British art and craftsmanship were rediscovered and once again carried forward the beauty of Western calligraphy. There are many calligraphers such as Edward Head Oden (English: Edward Johnston), Eric Jose (English: Eric Gill), has been influenced.\n\nWestern important contemporary calligraphers are Arthur Baker (English: Arthur Baker) with Herman Cheap. As handwriting is increasingly seen in communication behavior, Western calligraphy is gradually seen in special circumstances and activities, most of them use the wedding invitation and notice.\n\nIslamic calligraphy is made with Islam and Arabic. Because of the Arabic letters, some people are also called \"Arabic Calligraphy\", but Islamic calligraphy is a more accurate noun, including a variety of Islamic calligraphy works, and the location from the southern Spain to China.\n\nIn Islamic countries, calligraphy and Western calligraphy are generally the same. Because Islam prohibits idol worship, there is no painting in a large number of religious themes like the Christian world, so use a calligraphy work of Arabic letters into the most important visual art. From Spain to India, calligraphy work written in arabic alphabet is everywhere.\n\nArab pattern like the mosque wall and the ceiling is Islamic calligraphy. The contemporary artists in the Muslim world also inherit the Islamic calligraphy, used on the inscription or abstract pattern.\n\nIslamic calligraphy is the highest realm in the Islamic world, and is also the art of its spiritual world. There is no controversial, and Islamic calligraphy has become the most revered form in Islamic art because it provides links between Islam and Muslims. The Quran has an important role in the development and evolution of Arabic, and also extends into Islamic calligraphy. Scriptures in the proverb and the Quran are still an important source of Islamic calligraphy.\n\nIt is generally considered that Islamic calligraphy performances in the Em Tuman Empire. Islamic calligraphy in Turkey has the most refined and most creative work. Istanbul is a variety of Islamic calligraphy and open exhibition halls in the mosque, fountains, schools and residential inscriptions of Islamic calligraphy.\n\nModern and contemporary Islamic calligraphy, it focuses on Turkey, Egypt and Iraq, represents people with Turkey Hamid Adidi, Egypt's Said Ibrahimi and Iraqi Hashim Muhammad [6 ]. In 1986, the First International Arabic Calligraphy Competition, in addition to Saudi Arabia and Syria, the rest of all medals were included in Turkish Calligraphychers [7].\n\nMaya calligraphy is in Mayan text, and the current Maya calligraphy is mainly used in the seal and monuments of Jukatan, Mexico. Mayan calligraphy is rarely used in the official agency, but in Campeche and Jinsanario, Mayan calligraphy is represented by Latin. Some South Mexico companies will use Mayan calligraphy in their business symbols. Some community and modern Mayan brothers will use Mayan calligraphy as the symbol of the organization.\n\nMost Mexican archaeological sites (like in Caibaya, Labaron (English: Labna), Usmar, Karack Moore, etc.) will have its Maya TX. The stone carving monument is often seen from the ancient Mayan calligraphy.\n\nModern calligraphy is widely used, from functional inscriptions and lettering, to exquisite art abstract handwritten markers, text may be easy to understand, or it may not consider its readability [8]. Classical calligraphy is different from font laying and non-classical handwriting, but calligraphers may be familiar with these parts [9] [10] [11] [12].\n\nCalligraphy is still often used in a wedding invitation, a word type design and font mint, original handwritten letters or word symbol design, religious art, announcement, pattern design and calligraphy art, stone carving inscription and commemorative document. Calligraphy is also commonly used in motors or moving images, recommendations, birth certificates, death certificates, maps and other occasions [13] [14].\n\nEman Empire in Arabic (Western Yuan 1791, Islarm 1206)\n\nShikasta Poscope\n\nNon-words writing (English: Asemic Writing) and abstract calligraphy\n\nCalligraphy display in Tallinn, Estonia Capital Tallinn\n\n[Edit in Wiki Data] Buddhism (English: buddhism) originated in the Gu Shiko Swiguo (now Nepal and Indian border), Daxie Qiao, was 35 years old. After the Sakyamuni Buddha, The teachings of \"bitterness, set, destroy, and road\" presenting the disciples have been transferred to religion in the modern world, and is one of the three religions of the modern world. For the world, especially in East Asia, Central South Peninsula has a profound impact, in addition, cultures in Central Asia, South Asia and Nanyang Islands have extensive influences, and is now developing to Europe, Africa, North America. Buddhism experienced the development of history, through the two spread routes in the south, and the modern existence of Buddhism in the middle of the South China, the two branches of the North Biography, the Mahayana Buddhism is divided into Xianzong (the main content of Han Chuan Buddhism) and Tibet (Tibet) The main content of Buddhism), so there is also a seat, Han Chuan Buddhism (big), Tibetan Buddhism (King Kong) three-point method [Note 1], there are many sects; Nanchuan is mainly Luo Han Guo is the highest breeze, and the north is pursuing in the future, it is called Nirvana.\n\nThe ciglers are Sakyamuni Buddha, which is generally called \"Buddha\", \"Buddha\" is a sense of consciousness, and it is impossible to include the Three Buddhas. Buddhism is the intention of Buddha, not the religion of God Buddha, which is more like a philosophy than other religious doctrines. This is because of the most primitive Buddhist concept, there is no clear point of definition, and even against superstition, Buddha It is considered that time thinking about the concept of hardships. \"Dharma\" is, \"the pain comes from the desire\", the Buddhist is \"the person who believes this law\", the Buddhist \"the highest principle\" is \"the pain does exist, how can I escape?\" The existing Buddhism The Buddha and Bodhisattva are also developed by the later sects [1].\n\nBuddhism has made an indelible contribution to world cultural dissemination in history. Buddhism attaches great importance to the progress and consciousness of human minds and morality. According to Buddhist opinions, people and other six sentient beings, indulge in bitterness, and constantly rotating life and death, but only unknown talents can be separated from the three worlds, no longer reincarnation. Buddhists practiced the purpose of Dharma, that is, follow and practice all the four-holy \u8c1b, seeing through life and the truth of the universe, breaking all troubles, and finally surpassing the old and sick and all suffering, ending the six reincarnation, getting the liberation, getting Nirvana's realm.\n\nIn 2010, the census showed about 500 million Buddhists in the world [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]. The population distribution of world Buddhists in the 21st century is: 67.3% (360 million people), 28% (150 million people), 3.4% (18 million people) in the Buddhist region of Tibetan Buddhism, 1.3 % (7 million people). [10]\n\nThe ancient Indian society before Buddhism, Brahmen's conviction is dedicated to God - the three major primary gods: Creating thousands of Brahm\u0101, protecting the gods, vi\u1e63h\u1e47u, and destroying, regeneration, and dance god wet wife (\u015biva), think He dominated everything. By praying for these gods, he can get the benefits of the world, so they gradually have a variety of sacrifices, as well as the praise of various gods, and write records into four \"Vedures\".\n\nBrahmin believes that all the surnames of the ancient Indian society are born by Brahma; Brahmen is generated by the head or mouth, the highest position is the highest; the brakes are generated by the arms, and the status is second to Brahmen; Due to the long-term huge differences between ethnicity, social division, cultural education, etc., the ancient Indian society gradually differentiates into four very unequal classes such as Brahmen, Bag Demuli, Lesha and State Luo, and actually a set of blood. On the social rating system, called a subscriber system. Among them, Brahmen mainly engaged in sacrifice, braked emperor's world, the handicraft industry, the singer, the maintenance of the country, and the maintenance of the poor, engaged in a more low profession. In addition, there is a \"spree\" class outside the four surnames, the status is lower, called \"in contactless\". [11] [12] According to the famous \"Datang Western Regions\" of the Tang Dynasty Xuanzang Master: \"His Brahman, Learn the Si Bun Tunatory. One Skull, It is said to be raised; the second is to enjoy the sacred pray;\u66f0 \u5e73, the etiquette, the military, the military, the four, the number of skills, the top of the curse doctor. \"\n\nThe many unfortunate thoughts brought about by the surname system, people are called \"Shamen New Thoughts\" (Sanskum: \u015brama\u1e47a), including the Buddhism of religious reform.\n\nIn the first sixth centuries in BC, India's social productivity has risen, enough to support a large number of prosperous production, thinking and pursuing the truth of the universe, these Shamen is supported by the customs of the people; at the same time India is in a tropical environment, more fruits and vegetables It is often available in the four seasons, and it also provides convenient and safeguards for the diet of Shamen. Under this condition, \"Shamen's new trend\" is rapidly developed, and all kinds of non-Poemun thinking, mainly include the following genres:\n\nSakyamuni Buddha (Buddha) was born in Nepal today, part of the Indian cultural circle, and other local, religious culture, which were affected by Indian civilization. Recently, the \"Buddha is Nepalese is not an Indian\", which is not accurate, because the concept of these two countries does not exist. [13] About the students who have learned a multi-proud prince have two, there are two different types of Buddhism, one is considered to be the month of the month of May 543 BC, and the other is the first 589 years. Or prior to 588.\n\nSiddharta Qiao Ma Mao is born, it will be seen by the Anti-Dai Shengxian and other gods and preprophydroids will become a generation of Run Run, or out of its own road as the most distinguished provenance. In order to avoid him in order to avoid him, I expel with the pain, ugly thing that can see, and leave a desire, good thing. However, it is so far to see the old man, the patient, the dead person, and the people who see the people are impermanent, and they see the Salou, which will be solemn, and determine the identity and distinguished life of the royal family, and the Zen princes. After experiencing the hardship failure, I realized that I couldn't liberate the bitterness and just relying on meditation. Therefore, I entered the four three-way, and after the disturbance of the Devil's Army, I finally was 35 years old. Luo Shu (after being honored by Bodhi as a Bodhi tree), there is no matter what is equal, and it is known as the Buddha, Sakyamuni. After that, he walked through the branches of the Ganges, gave people a very deep truth they found, and gradually attracted more and more people to listen to his teaching law, and accepted some people to follow him, which was built. Among them, the five ministers followed by the Siddhand practitioners who had just watched the home have accepted the teaching of the Siddhand to become the Buddha, becoming the first batch of Biqiu, which is the first batch of Shanha [14]. The Buddha believes that all beings are equally, against the surname system, unwilling to preach to the people from all walks of life and the people of each identity. He went around in the middle of the decades, recruiting many disciples, and the influence of Buddhism gradually expanded. The Buddha died during the 80-year-old (Buddhism said it was Yumiro).\n\nAfter the Buddha, after four assets - all sects were only recognized by the first twice. In addition, modernity has two assemblies, syndicated, six collection, but did not receive Northern Buddhist recognition - the classic basic formation of this Buddhism. The latter group split into multiple sects, each development, slowly fused, roughly there is a Nanchuan Buddhism that evolved from the Volkswagen, the evolution of the Shediarian evolved; from the Peacock Dynasty, Buddhism spread to the north and south direction. Nan Chuan Buddhism (now the surdo of Buddhism) spreads to Southeast Asia via Celan, mainly affects the Zhongnan Peninsula in Southeast Asia. Beichuan Buddhism (also known as the Mahayan Buddhism) was to arrive at Xinjiang in Kashmir. When the Buddhism in the Eastern Han of the 1st Century was introduced into China, it was passed into the Korean Peninsula, Japan; Bei Chuan Buddhism officially introduced into India north from the 8th century Tibet; hereinafter, Bei Chuan Buddhism is divided into two Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhism. Tibetan Buddhism has great influence on the living culture of Tibetan people, and later passed into Mongolia and Northeast China and other regions. By 16 or 17th century, Tibetan Buddhism has laid the foundation in the far East.\n\nDevelopment and communication schedule of Buddhist inheritance\n(450 years - Jet 1300)\n\n\nIndia\nInitial Buddhism\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSri Lanka and Southeast Asia\n\n\n\n\nCentral Asia (English: Buddhism in Central Asia)\n\nGreek Buddhism\n\n\nSilk Road Buddhism (English: Silk Road Transmission of Buddhism)\n\nEast Asia\n\nHan Chuan Buddhism believes that everything is unreasonable to live in Tianjie, humanity, Ashura, beast, hungry ghost and hell. The South is only five. Because greed is constant, there is no end, and it is considered that the endless trouble is suffering and incompatible.\n\nThe purpose of Buddhism is to liberate from the reincarnation. It means that life is able to get out of life and death reincarnation and its various bitterness. From 'Roundback', 'Nirvana' thus 'release' is Hinduism, Jain, etc. India The common concept of religion, but the specific connotation is different.\n\nBuddhist doctrines believe that Nirvana is a state in which all all the people in the world are all exhausted, so Nirvana will never have all kinds of troubles, pain, and the insights of the multiplication, the insights are no longer affected.\n\nSakyamuni Buddha's words: Although only Sakyami is a Buddha, but in his life, this world has had Buddha's birth, and there will be Buddha's birth in the future, and now there is a lot of Buddha. Therefore, Buddhism does not think the Buddha is unique. Buddhism admits that there are countless Buddhas in the past, now and the future, and believe that all people, all the lovers (mainly referred to animals), regardless of the Buddha or not, there will be a Buddha in the future. Buddhism believes that the Buddha is a realistic sentient beings, and all beings are the Buddha that has not been realized. At the realm, the mortal is different from the saints, but the Buddha is equally equal, so Buddhism does not worship the Buddha as the only God, and does not admit that there is another universe Creator. So the Buddha and Buddhists are atheist. [15]\n\nBuddhism's teaching, the teachings deep Hongbo, the words can only be metaphor, it is difficult to clarify that the experience people can self-understanding the trueity. The simplest summary of Buddhist doctrines is that the Buddha's educational point is only one - bitter stop, interest (tendon) to Nirvana. In terms, the basic doctrine of Buddhism is the basic doctrine of three legs (or three-phase), four, eight bitter, twelve factors, four survival, and \"seven Buddha\" - \"\u8bf8 \u83ab \u83ab \u83ab, The good deeds; self-cleaning, is a summary of Buddhism. [16]. In Mahayana Buddhism, there are four legal stations.\n\nThe so-called bitter is because everything is to die, all the existence is due to the performance of the edge, and the origin is survive. When the fate is done, it is temporary, it can be separated, no entity, ie The so-called cavity (not empty, but fancy, nature is empty), and once the persistence is considered to be forever, it is not separable, there is an entity, and it will feel pain when all things will be destroyed. All beings are unknown, persistent, and the heart is in good condition, so they can't stand in life and death. In order to destroy the bitterness, it is separated from the six reincarnation, and the Buddha said that the Buddha has. The effluent includes the sound of the ride, the fate, and believes that it is a sound of four fruit arrants and the fate to open the Buddha. If there is no longer Ignore, this is the main teaching of Nanchuan Buddhism. Bodhisattva is awarded to become a Buddha in the future. After three major Amuse, he has been constantly giving a six-degree Puji people, and eventually gains no bodhi, becoming the Buddha Zunzun like Sakyamuni. No Yixinji is liberation, this is the main teaching of Beichuan Buddhism and Han Chuan Buddhism; Bodhisattva has also inherited in Nanchuan, but the content is simpler than north, there are many statements. The Bodhisattva has another branch, and it is believed that there is no need to practice the three major Amusement, and it is the main teaching of Zen and Tibetan Buddhism, but it is generally considered to be \"\" \"Buddha\" is not a satisfactory Buddha.\n\nThere are many ways to practice the hard practice, which can be summarized as a quitter Hui three studies, eight holy roads and thirty-seventh products.\n\nThe three legal prints are: \"There is no normal print, the law is not in my print, Nirvana Static\".\nThe North Biography Buddhism is in compliance with this three principles. Nanchuan Buddhism said that there are three phases, which is impermanent, bitter, no, without saying three law, in fact, the concept is different. Nirvano is not a line, nirvan is not impermanent, but because \"the law is not me\", Nirvana is not me.\n\nAccording to Buddhist traditions, the four saints (bitter gathering deck) is the core of the Division of Buddhism. The meaning of the meaning here is true, true, truth.\n\nThe twelve won clearly tells the relationship between the three consequences.\nBuddhism believes that the world is still born, and there is an incident. There is no thing that does not rely on other things and independence, anything is due to the happens; there is nothing to be affected by other things, and there is nothing else to affect anything else; anything is before There are also consequences, and this causal relationship constitutes a neuroped chain. And according to one of the trends, as the phenomenon of life, the cause of the life of the life is not a constant life. Twelve factors specific content: \"None of the fate, the row, the knowledge color, the famous color edge is six, six into the edge of the contact, the fidelity, accepting love, love, taking, taking, there is a chance, Floral old disease is sad, \"among them:\n\nAfter repairing four clues, it will disconnect the twelve factor [20] and end the round.\n\nWhether it is to become a Buddha, a Buddha, the Archeon disciple of the Buddha must repair the four-story, such as the spirit of the five-year-in-law [21] and impermanence, bitter, no me [22], there is a way to prove four, four fruit , Nirvana, disconnect all troubles and leave the reincarnation, and you can't identify four, four fruit, nirvana, and disconnect all troubles [23].\n\nThe Bodhisattva of the Mahayana Buddhism is dominated by six degrees (North Chuan Liupo), with the three big arrival time to accumulate Ford, wisdom, and Rao Yisheng, and finally have a successful Buddha. For the high-end multiplier, it is necessary to encourage good law, and the Bodhi is not returned.\n\nThe Buddhist World Viewing is self-interest, the Buddha sees the world's past, now, the future appearance of the world, and presents people.\n\nAll beings have nothing to do, there is a result, good business must have a good news, and the evil must have a bad report, what is the power and causality. Because of the common business (common business), it has formed a world, because all sentients are different (individuals), and they are reported and felt.\n\nThe world is divided into love in the world, in which the environment and the mentality behavior characteristics are divided into three worlds - want the world (sex), color circles (no sexual desire but have a substance), colorless circle There is no consciousness existence). There is a six-way beings in love, and it is a living body, and it is here to see it. The world is ie, landscape, land and so on.\n\nThe so-called world (Sanskrit: lokadhatu) is in the world. There is a Mi Mi, a small world, and the world is surrounded by Missha, and there are four major departments and the nine sea. It is Msi Mingshan, hell is hell, and the upper and upper void is people. Room, desire sky, color world. One thousand small worlds are small in the world, a thousand thousands of worlds are thousands of worlds, a thousand thousands of worlds are the world. Xiaoqian World, the thousands of worlds, the world is known \"Three thousand thousand people\", not to say \"three thousand thousands of worlds\", and only one Buddha is born. Mahayana Buddhism believes that there are countless Buddhas in all worlds from their respective three thousand worlds.\n\nOur world is called the world, located in the southern part of the four continents (also translated into a Yanfuzhou), is the center of the three thousand thousand people, more specific, in the Buddha's Buddha, Nepal, India is a center of the world.\n\nThe origin of the world is described in \"The World\".\n\nThe origin of the world is not created by any Creeders, it is called by all beings. All things have four stages of a bad empty, also known as robbery, living, bad robbery, empty robbery, meaning to build, maintain, collapse, demise, and then reincarnation. The same is true for our husband and wife. There is no robbery, and the world is destroyed and reborn and destroyed. For the time, the past is called the solemn robbery, now is called Xiancheng, the future is a star robbery; the \u52ab \u5343 \u5343 \u5343 \u51fa, the Buddha before Sakyamuni is [[\u53f6 | | .mw-Parser-Output Ruby .zzy {text-align: Justify; Text-Justify: None} .mw-parser-output ruby.zy> rp {user-select: none} .mw-parser-output ruby.zy> RT {font-feature-settings : \"Ruby\" 1; Padding: 0 0.1em; user-select: none} (sh\u011b) Buddha]], before the past, the Buddha's name, after the Buddha is Maitreya - Malaysia Buddhism \"Think that Maitreya Bodhisattva is currently living in the pure land of the Tyuten, the pure land is waiting for the Buddha; each small robbery has a locked, the score of robbery, the so-called increase or decrease is the life expectancy of the person. At present, the burning robbery is in the stage of robbery.\n\nThe world is destroyed when the bad robbery is destroyed, and three disasters, water, and wind, three disasters. The seven rounds of the sun are empty, and the world is burn into ashes; when the floods, the rain, \"boiling ash\" (like sulfuric acid can be corroded), flooding, the two meditation is immersed; Spicy, the three Zen days are filled. The four Zen days are not affected, while the two-Zen sound of the sound is not affected by fire. When the fire started, the sentient beings saw the disaster. They were all sent to the past, began to repair ten good, because of the good industry, so they lived to the light sound. When the world is successful, the world is beginning to work, and the next generation is found in the world. It is until the real world set up the wind, water, golden three-element (round), and generates Mi Mi, Qijin Mountain, four major arches on the gold wheel. The sound of the sound is born in all walks of life, and finally in the world [30] [31].\n\nInitially, the heavens in the next life still have magic, which can be flying. Because of the development of the business, the ground naturally growing the taste of \"Flat\", there is a food, it is often seeding, so these people are gradually thick, no light, and the god disappeared, no longer as the day People with joy is food, but must eat with fertilizer, and have been ugly, and some of the sound is less than eating, still maintaining the appearance of the man. This has the score of beauty, and there is a heartless heart and arrogance [32]. Since then, the fat is gradually disappeared, and glutinous rice has a glutinous rice, and people have a glutinous rice. Time is long, some desires are heavier to be born for women, and there is a division of men and women in the world, and there is a lust between men and women [33]. I started to disgust the love, but I have a dedication, people have expelled, and they can return to the group after three months. Later, the desires are getting more, people build homes, not see, women at this time Start pregnancy, human born approach from naturalized students into pregnant birth. Humans have more birth, the glutinous rice is not enough to eat, people compete hoard, and the glutinous rice is less, and the ground is born on the ground. In order to eat rice for a long time, it is divided into planting. Some people have saved sales, some people have robbed, but they must be cut off, others see people to change the evil, and they will come to build meditation, and they don't sit in meditation, and they will previse the classics and sacrifice the heavens. So there is a businessman, farmer, elder, and priest, etc. (by using Indian prostitutes, as a metaphor), and then established a royal family and country. Also because human beings have repeated, there is a production of animals, hungry and ghosts, and hell roads. At this point, the world is final.\n\nBuddhist scriptures were originally from the assembly of Buddhist disciples. The \"Tibet\" integrated is also known as \"Sui Cable Tibet\". \"Law\" transliteration is \"Nini\", so \"Law\" can also be called \"Pini\"; \"the Tibetan\" transliteration is \"Abji Grinding\". The early Tibet of Buddhism, the contents of the law, the content of the law, and the difference is different.\n\nThe upper part of the Buddhist \"Bali Law\" records the Buddha to say that the Tibetan Tibetan [34], Bali Tibetan records the \"Abbid Dieni, An Nishi,\" [35], the small part of the biography \"Bodhisattva Once I followed Chen Ruver, Fasfon, Keri Buddha, the family studied the Tibetan Aji Dinda, the Bodhisattva was in the fourth seven days after the Buddha spent seven days in the northwest of the Bodhi Tree, the \"Baojia\" thinking about the content of Tibetan Aji Da mill [ 36]. Whether the academic community is related to the early assembly, it is unconventional. Most scholars believe that Abida mill is gradually developing, explaining, explaining, and further elaborated, organizational and systematic. \"Abji Dawe\" in the law often appears together with \"Aby Nijay\", but this term does not necessarily mean the current standardization. [37] The academic community generally believes that the procurement of Buddhism may contain the Buddha, and some scholars advocate that most of their content is the Buddha. [38]\n\nThe broad Buddhist script contains multifaceted content, Buddhist history, Buddhist directory, Buddhist works, China's summary of such Buddhism's generalized Buddhist classics into a \"big Tibet\", or everything. Tibetan Buddhism divides the classic into Ganzhuier, Danzhuier. South Chuan Buddhism uses the name of the three hidden. Because of the different places, there is a subtle difference, so in the translation of Chinese habits to use the \"Da Tibet\" translation of other systematic classics, such as the name of Nanchuan Buddhism is \"Bali Treasury\", and the European and American schools often Use the three-hidden name [39] (also using Japanese \"Treasure\", but relatively small). In the Buddha, it is clear that the Buddha allows disciples to use dialects to pass the Buddha and book a classic. The academic circles have focused on the changes in Buddhist scriptures, and the changes in the Buddha were circulated, and which were the teaching law of the Buddha's era, which is the later development.\n\nBuddhists can be divided into homes and in their families. The family is subdivaled out of the bikhi, Bhikcuni, Shami, Shaemi, TKATIN, saying the five people; in the family, according to gender, it can be divided into Youso, Men, Yousong Yi, Waiti, etc. The two are collectively referred to.\n\n\u8888\u88df (Sanskrit: K\u1e63\u1e63\u1e63ya; Balli: Kas\u0101va), it is known as the color, not color, because the Buddha stipulates that the name cannot be dyed as positive (bright color, solid color) is named; it is also known as Futian clothes, Tian Saixing, The split square is similar to the field, and Yu Zhong livelike seeing Futian Clothing is a family, happy, willing to support, cultivating Futian.\n\nThere are three small three pieces of large middle and small, and the names of the greece are also known as nine clothes, coats, and the Chinese famous princes are also known as seven clothes, the small name Avocad is also known as five clothes. In the case of different occasions, it is called three clothes, and there is a \"three clothes that do not leave\" in the commandments of family members. The traditional Buddhist monks have to carry three clothes with you.\n\n\u8888\u88df\u8888\u88df From India, inherit the style of Indian traditional costumes, is very obvious, and the Buddha said that the Three Buddhas are wearing the same style. [40]. Nowadays, South-Biography is still in daily wear, and the passage of different countries is slightly different. When Buddhism first entered the Han Di, the Han people cooperated with the traditional clothing Hanfu, and gradually became a form. Only the Fa Conference was still wearing; however, Xuanhua people also criticized the phenomenon of the family, but in his The Dao Wanfo City strictly promotes the ancestral system that does not leave. In Tibet, \u8888\u88df also varies depending on the local style, the different sects of the sect also have color differences; after the Han Chuanzheng to Japan, because of historical reasons, it also develops \"half-embarrassing\" such a pure table and ignore the clothes. Significance style.\n\nIn the Han Di, the seafood, three treasures, straightforward, etc. At the Fa Conference, Han Di also had a five Buddha crown, and thousands of Buddha clothes and other wear. There was also an emperor in history.\n\nThe Buddhist monks distinguish between people's image is the most easy to identify the bald head or short hair. When the Buddha was cut off with a knife, he was called \"Bald\" by his Brahmen to teach Saume. Later, he went out of the saints of the saints, and a small amount of hair is used to block. Meat.\n\nBuddhism believes that there will be too much hair to make life to the pain of the colors (you can understand as a passionate dress, forget the essential task), saying that the hair is \"troubles\", but can usually leave the length (about 3 cm). Therefore, the monks of the original Buddhist monks need to take the knife with you, used to cut the clothing, and cut hair. In Tibetan Buddhism, because the sun is extremely strong, there are generally two fingertips to block the ultraviolet. In the Han Di, due to the historical reasons of the Song Dynasty, there was a habit of hot crash, and modern has been abolished, only the characteristics of shaving heads.\n\nThe law name, the law is the religious title of Buddhists. The name is the name of the family, and is relatively similar. The title of the law is the title of the influence, and the monks are advisable and can be taken in the commonswo.\n\nIn the Mahayanian Buddhism, Buddhism's believers self-calling the disciple of Buddhism, and the disciple of Buddhism; where Buddha's family is also self-designed, the children of Buddha are also known as Buddha. Han Chuan Buddhism has established the tradition of the \"release\" word \"release\" in Dong Jin, Sakyamuni, and the monks are in front of \"Interpretation\", such as the printing of Indian, Vietnam, a row of Zen teachers, but there is no such region, but in the name. For example, the name of Damo Zu Master is the meaning of Sanskrit Dharma, \"Act\", \"Dharma\", is not called \"Sakyama Tam\".\n\nThere are a variety of styles for your head. Because Buddhism is born in \"Shamen Tide\", the Buddha is also known as Shamen (Sanskrit: \u015brama\u1e47a, Balli: Sama\u1e47a); because it is a home and seek, he is called family (Ballikaarika); One member, so I said, Sangha (Balli: Sa\u1e45gha, Sanskrit: Sa\u1e43gha), etc. Generally known as Mage (Sanskrit: Dharma-Bh\u1e47\u1e47aka, Ballma-kathika; original is a kind of monk, righteousness, teaching teacher, and becomes a monk's respect), elderly or upper seat (Sanskrit: Sthavira, Bali : Thera), Supreme or Saints (Sanskrit: \u0101rya, Yi Zun Sheng), Dad (Sanskrit: Bhadanta), which is common in all Buddhist definitions, especially in the south-transmissive upper seat.\n\nIn the Han Di, also known as monk (this is the meaning of professor, \"now has become a representation of the monks), Master (not master), go out, a family, a monks, monks, and a master (original refers to the Buddha, then refer to Gao Shuang, Modern is commonly known as Buddhism), sorghum, pedestrians (the practitioners, generally finger people, can self-proclaimed in common children), Taoist (Yi is a monk, people, etc.) In the middle, there are also monks who claim to be real people), etc .; Hostel, abbot, deacons, supervision halls, people, Taoist, and other faculty.\n\nIn Tibetan Buddhism, there is also a lama (Yi Yue), Kanbu (Tibetan translation of professor, is equivalent to the intention of Hani, generally for the monasterist), Rinpoche (Ningbo car, righteous treasure), Dalai, Ban Zen, living Buddha, yoga, yogi, etc.\n\nDivided into Youppye (Sanskrit: Up\u0101saka), both of the Po Yi (Sanskrit: Up\u0101sik\u0101), also known as the Han Dynasty (Sanskrit: g\u1e5bhapati), Chinese translation, at home.\n\nAs a hill, the Bhikkuni must be held in the foot, Shami, Shaemi must be rushed to Sand, and the trifut is Saff. The commandments of the family are more detailed than the family, and the Han Chuan Buddhism is 250, and 348 in Bhikuni; the Nanchuan Buddhism is full of 227. Shami, Shamini and the Forkama were much less than the stages of the formal Biqiu and the bikhi. According to the Buddha, Biqiu and Bhiges, in the month of the month, Bosa, studying the commandments, if there is a command, the remorse, the people repent.\n\nAfter the housekeepers and girls can follow the five rings after converting; the five rings are: (1) Do not kill, do not kill anything all animals or love. (2) Do not steal, do not steal, fraud or robbing others. (3) If you are not evil, the man is not with \"Women who guard others\" [41]. (4) I don't tell me, don't lie, not, don't say it. (5) Alcohol drinks do not drink non-medicine wine. It is not to cultivate the compassion of all beings, theft and evil spirits are the ban on the world. It is not to avoid alcohol's order, but because of alcoholic anesthesia to reduce wisdom. Guoshou is in order to get the merits and interests of the ring, even if you can't hold the ring, you can always believe in Buddha, first and wish, return to Dharma, depish.\n\nIn addition to the five quings, there are further ten good industries. In addition to the good words, there is no words, not bad, not bad. In addition to the five quings, the arms can be held in the family, there is also eight off. Southeast Asian countries also have a happiness at home (holding out the counseling) to gain a custom. [42]\n\nIn addition, the Hanfa Buddhism can hold the Bodhisattva in the family. Tibetan Buddhism has Tibetan Bodhisattva.\n\nHan Si is called Van Yin, Vatican, because Buddhism is born in the Indian civilized district, and the music form and instrument used is Indian, and they are spread with local music as Buddhism is in the world, and they are integrated with local music. Such as a blow musical instrument India (Shehnai, from ancient Persian) is incorporated into the Han Di, it has become a \u5522 \u5522 today, and so on. Tibetan Buddhist instruments fused in Indian, benzo, forming a unique copper.\n\nIn addition, India's Zhuzong is paying attention to singing, it is rich in rhythm, convenient memory, which is also brought into Buddhist traditions. Han Si said that it is Vatican, singing with wood fish, bell, and accompaniment, and all localities have all the places, such as Tianjin Vatican, Chongqing Shangjiang.\n\nThe modern Buddha also has a large development, and the new century style is integrated. If the Taiwan Buddha is Huang Yin, there are also some gentle and soothing light music to help yoga, meditation.\n\nThe original Buddhism does not have a habit of sculpting paintings, more Buddha's footprints, Falun as a worship target, meaning more.\n\nDuring the Angjan, Buddhist sculptures were more common, and it is also more common for plastic performance of various stories. The most prestigious representative is a Greek-style \u728d. With the global spread of Buddhism, statues sculpture all over the local style and develop their own unique aesthetics. For example, the Buddha statue of Myanmar is more jade carvings, the image is full; the Thai area likes to use gold, there is a lot of money, The buddhism of the Buddha is hidden; the image of the Tibetan image pays attention to the symbol of the soft and handheld, the Buddha statue is usually fine, and the Buddha statue is a Tangka; Han Di's sculpture painting is greatly improved by Buddhism And improved, from the transformation of the transformation to the realistic facts, and develop the art form of the transformation, the Buddha statue is full of rich state, the ear tone is long, and the pleats of the clothes are vivid.\n\nBuddhist literature is mainly reflected in the Buddhist scriptures. The Buddhist scriptures have a general structure, such as the beginning of \"such as I smell\", end with \"circulation points\"; Buddhist scriptures, simple, primitive Buddhism multi-use Bari Wen, etc., then use Indian Jaccent, Han Chuan The classics of Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhism are mainly from the Buddhist scriptures from the Vive lady (but Sanskrit is mostly lost), so existing three major inherits are also divided into Balli, the Chinese Department, Tibetan Tibetan system [43]. The most close to the folk customs in Buddhist literature is the fable story collection \"Bailian Jing\".\n\nIn the translation of Buddhism, the roughly context can also be separated, the Chinese Buddhist scriptures are the Eastern Han Dynasty, the Eastern Jin to the Northern Dynasty, the Sui Dynasty, the Tang Dynasty and the Song Dynasty, during this period, the Morosh, the true meaning, Xuanzang and not The four major translators \", making great contributions to the development of Buddhist translation and the development of Chinese language, especially Xuanzang Master,\" five kinds of non-turning \", becoming a standard.\n\nBuddhism's folk literature mainly focused on Buddha's past life (such as \"Buddha praise\") and Buddhist disciples, this is quite popular in Southeast Asia [44]. Some Buddha's Buddhism has become a major source of folk literature, many local stories have the tendency of the Buddhist story, such as the tendency to absorb each other in India, Buddhist stories and Hindu, such as \"Braho Capricorn \"In Tibet, Han Di is also more obvious, such as Mongolian, Tibetan national epic\" Gesal King \"has many Buddhism, benzene, and the story of Han Dynasty is Taoism, Confucianism. The Buddhist scriptures.\n\nIn the Chinese cultural circle, Buddhist culture has already penetrated into the Chinese culture and Chinese culture, not only many Buddhist words become Chinese common words, and in Japan, the Korean Peninsula, Vietnam and other places are widely circulated, but also promotes the development of folk culture. Tang Poetry, the prosperity of Song Words is also aware of Buddhist culture, such as poetry of poetry, many pictures come from Buddhism, Taoism; Many words are directly from Buddhist terminology, such as Buddha. On the basis of changing, the monks develop common words, change, they play the purpose of the Buddhist story and doctrine to the people who do not know; on the basis of its basis, continue to develop (speak), Baoli and other folk literature More than talk about Buddhist stories, but put the field of view in historical allusions and legend. The \"Yi Yi\" in the Tang Dynasty was the deformation of Buddha [45], Wu Zetian wrote a famous \"open\" \u8d5e \u8d5e [46]. The drama literature in the Yuan Dynasty was rapidly developed, and Buddhist stories also showed in the opera. Scholars believe that this phenomenon is \"Buddhist literature\" and \"literary Buddhism\" [47] [48].\n\nIn modern times, Buddhist literature has more popular development trend. Due to the influence of \"human Buddhism\" thought, Buddhism reveals the characteristics of chemicalization [49].\n\nThe Buddhist early monks live in the woods, called Aranya, is abbreviated as Lan Ruo, which is the woods, which are distant, away from the secular place. The first room for the group is bamboo forest, the second is a tree that is located on the tree. Early known as hooks (ViH\u0101ra), the exquisite house; \"Sakney\" is originally the title of Confucianism, Buddhism is brought into the Chinese translation of Sanskrit Vih\u0101ra; (Ji\u0101) Samgh\u0101r\u0101ma, the garden of Sangha, is a temple, referred to as gamwide.\n\nThe earliest record of Buddhism is in the Han Dynasty, and the court will build a Baima Temple for aunt. The temple is a political affairs department of the court, a total of nine, called Jiu Temple; after Buddhism, it gradually as a synonym of Buddha Temple, also known as monasteries. China traditionally welcomed Buddha and Bodhisattva, the religious place of God, the ancestors, called the temple, and even the title of \"temple\" in dialects, in fact, Buddhist temple should not be called the temple, because the temple is specialized in Buddhist temples, while temples Originally, it is the \"temple\", such as the ancestral temple, Temple, Confucius, these temples should not be called \"temple\".\n\nIn the southern part of Yunnan, China (North Thai Yi, ACA, Deru, etc.), the Buddhist temple of the surcharge, the Buddhist temple is also known as the housing, and the Burma Temple.\n\nStroke, originally an Indian earth grave, also used to put the Buddha reserves, classics, etc.\n\nIn China referred to as the tower, or called the floating tower (Buddha), the Buddha, is a deformerus generated after combining the Chinese style building.\n\nThere are two algors of the Buddha, one is generally popular in the Buddha and the discipline in the southern biography area, that is, in the first year of Sakyamuni, it is the first year; one is the Buddha's birthday, that is, Sakyamun Birthday (birth) is the first year.\n\nNanchuan, Beichuan is born in the Buddha, from home, Chengdao, Nirvana records, in fact, the most conservative estimates of the specific years on the Buddha deeds around the country, the Millennium [50]. At the 1950th World Buddhist Friendship Association, the World Buddhist Friendship Hall held by Sri Lalan (Celan), the world's Buddhist community has made a joint provision: the Buddha is born in the first 623th day of the day; the Buddha is 29 Years, Chengdao is 35 years old; that is, the first 588th months to witness the star enlightenment; the Buddha said 45 years, 80 years old, Nugan, 543 BC, the day and night in the month, the Buddha is from the Buddha I started.\n\nThe moon of the Buddhist calendar, there is a set of jurisdictions, and Han Di is accurate with the lunar calendar, that is, a yin and medium calendar.\n\nIn the Han Di, the Buddha is usually marked with the sky, such as the Tibetan, Guanyin, Ten Dahai. Some of the influence of the three shots, some will also mark some gods (ghost gods), the birthday and avoidance of the monks.\n\nThe Buddhist ceremony is called the Fatisculation, Fa Conference, etc. The rail specification is called the instrument. Different sects have a conference ceremony that combines monks and believers, as well as the rituals of three transactions, and the ring, and the traditional rituals such as homage, Bussa.\n\nThe religious ritual of Nanchuan Buddhism is relatively north to pass. For example, there are rituals who have invited the monks to hit the blessings in the Thai area.\n\nThe north biography Buddhism is more focused on the ritual, the localization characteristics are obvious. For example, Han Chuan Buddhism absorbs a large number of Taoist rituals, ceremonial order and ceremonial etiquette, local creation of the laws and land faith, etc., and some of India's ceremony such as Japan Tzan Popular care; Tibetan Buddhism absorbed Benzo ceremony, such as the customs such as \u6851 (\u796d).\n\nBuddhist common instruments have rosary (Beads), Monitan, Falun, Cooky, Cum, King Kong, Ring, etc., Falun is more like a symbol, mascot, is one of the symbols of Buddhism.\n\nHan Chuan Buddhism, other wooden fish, counting, curse wheel, mantry pendant; Tibetan Buddhism has a bone (human bone device), leg drum, \u560e (like pendant, can be installed, spell, spell).\n\nWinning a solemn Buddha, you can use fragrance, flowers, water, light candles, diet, buildings, \u5e62, etc.\n\nThere are many Buddhist holy land, mainly:\n\nBuddhism believes that the world has always been born in the future, and the Mahayan Buddhism also believes that he has a unity of the world's endless Buddha, and there is an endless sacred sacred bodhisattva under the Buddha's education, so he can't be all available here. Enumeral, just some famous Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and some are from the ancients.\n\nBuddhism believes that the world has all the days, hell, and the \"species\" of the animals, people, and the people. There are ghosts living in the sky, the world, the ocean, and the void. As a guardian of all beings, protecting the law and ghosts of the Buddhism, it is generally believed that there are eight people, called Tianlong Babu. In the later development, Buddhism will also absorb the gods of the outer road into the law-making law system.\n\nBuddhism has the deepest influence in Asian countries, and Buddhist thinking has integrated into the lives of people who believe in Buddhist countries. Although India has been a prosperous land of Buddhism, but today, it has been in the border of China, and Buddhist beliefs are only strong.\n\nAt present, Buddhism is mainly distributed in mainland China, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Mongolia, Vietnam, Singapore, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, Singapore, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, Brunei and Australian Christmas Island, and also India, Bangladesh, Philippines, Indonesia, Russia and Kazakh, etc. have sporadic distribution, and North Korea is crushed because of the local North Korean government, and the number of people who believe in Buddhism is very rare. 99% of Buddhist live in Asia. Among them, Buddhism is a national education in Thailand, Cambodia and Bhutan. In recent years, Buddhism has also developed in Western countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia. 72% of Buddhists are religious minorities in their residential countries, 28% belong to most groups, live in 7 countries (Mongolia, Bhutan, Myanmar, Thailand, Liao, Cambodia, Sri Lanka). [2]\n\nIn recent years, the spread of Buddhist beliefs is closely integrated with charities. It is like Taiwan Buddhist group actively spreads Buddhism and developing charity in the world, making Buddhist beliefs no longer limit Asian regions, such as: well-known Ciqi Gong Dehui Province funded the Caribbean Haiti, the Buddha Mountain group established a Buddhist temple in Brazil, Argentina. In addition, the ACC organization (Amitabha Care Center) established the first Buddhist Temple in Malaway, South Africa, gradually expanding to Swashi Lan and Xinbawei, opening Buddhist beliefs and charity in Africa.\n\nGlobal Buddhists reach 500 million, the number of Buddhists is far less than Christianity (about 2.4 billion letter) and Islam (about 1.5 billion letter) [2] [5] [9]\n[59] [4] [7] [60] [61], but it is still still considered Christianity, Islam and Buddhism are the world's three major religions [62] [63] [64]. This is because although Hindu's social demographics reached 1 billion people [60] is much higher than Buddhism, but Hindu teaches national restrictions, centralized countries (such as India or Nepal), and Judaism also has national restrictions (for example: congregation leads to Gentiles It is not easy to advice), compared to Buddhism advocates equality, peace and fraternity, and there is no national restriction, so Buddhism is generally believed to be more suitable for Christianity and Islam and call three major religions in the world.\n\nAlthough Buddhism has experienced unparalleled glory in Gu Indu, its influence is also spread to all parts of Asia, but in India's local decay.\n\nBuddhism has established the first-class academic centers in Gu Indu, such as the Nago Temple and other universities are the highest academics of Dharma and the science and philosophy. However, due to the educational education of the ancient Indian Buddhism to deal with the upper aristocrats and keen on high-profile academic thinking, it is incompletely neglected to the communication education of the middle and lower class, and the group is gradually become the upper aristocrat. Believe in close relationships, alienating the elite group of the middle and lower class people.\n\nTherefore, Buddhism has not been able to establish a family tradition of the upper middle and lower class public as other religions such as Boiren (the current Hindu), so that Buddhism gradually lost the public foundation in ancient India. Once the support of the king and the aristocrats has accelerated Buddhism in the decline of the ancient India.\n\nSince Ayongwang, Buddhism Sama is forbearing, and in the late 12th century, the Turkic people who believe in Islam invaded India, they were not friendly. The Buddhist temple such as the Tharaoh Temple was flattering by the Muslim army. In particular, the Library of the Tharaoa is paid, causing a large number of books in Buddhism and ancient Indian civilization disappeared. The articles of the ancient Indian Buddhism in this period were almost lost. However, a number of secret monks fled to the Bangladeshi area to be scared, from this batch of monks changed their faces, usually the same as civilians, and married the wife and children, abandon the arms to avoid the persecution of the Muslo, only in the believers, wedding and funeral Practice. India's residual Buddhism will reserve this, and in the last century, Burmese Wang Lai Banglan, the Karama, all of the Karama, all the Buddhism of the upper part.\n\nThe Buddhist scholars after robbery multi-pace is far away from Tibet. Buddhist holy land, such as Lantan, which is born in the Buddha, is also ruins. By the 13th century, Buddhism has almost disappeared in His birthplace India. Until the end of the 19th century, a revival movement appeared in a 400-year-old Buddhism in India. In 1957, the Indian Buddhists organized Buddhist Party India Republican Republicans (English: Republican Party Of India). Later, some of the people were still trapped by the political route of the DSH. The party has a certain impact on Mumbai and other places. According to statistics from 1980, India has 5,554,000 Buddhists, accounting for about 0.8% of the total population. India's Buddhists have little proportion of people accounting for rare, but in India's ideological and cultural community.\n\nIn 1956, BR Abeada (Am Bagl / Br Ambedkar) launched Dalt Buddhist campaign and believed in Buddhism in 1956 with approximately 1 million, and BR Ambedkar launched. Rit Buddhist movement and followed by about 1 million followers Buddhism. Ambedkar has revived Buddhism in India, and he is called Bodhisattva. In 1951, India's Buddhists were only 181,000. After this shift, Buddhists increased from 1600% to 3.2 million in 1961. [65] In 2011, India had 8,500,000 Buddhists, of which 7,300,000 (87%) were Ambedkar supporters. [66] [67] In the total number of Buddhists in India, the Maharashtra is 6.5 million Buddhists (77%). Ambedkar is the founder of India's greatest leaders, human rights activists, the author of the Indian Constitution, and the founder of the India Republic. Ambedkar has revived Buddhism in India, and he is called Bodhisattva. In 1951, India's Buddhists were only 181,000. After this shift, Buddhists increased from 1600% to 3.2 million in 1961. [65] In 2011, India had 8,500,000 Buddhists, of which 7,300,000 (87%) were Ambedkar supporters. [68] Maladian Buddhist community is the largest Buddhist community in India. In 2011, Maladian Buddhists exceeded 6.5 million, they lived in Maharashtra. [68]\n\nIt is generally believed that Buddhism is incorporated by the Western Field of India in the end of the Western Han Dynasty, and the Eastern Han Dynasty. According to the record, the Han Mei Diyuan Yuanshu (the first 2 years) Dr. Jing Lu (Qin Jingxian) broke the Dali, the Dali King, the Dali, the Buddhist classics, the history book called \"Floating String\", but not Strong from royal family. In the Eastern Han Dynasty, Ten Years (67 years), Hamming Emperor saw Jin people flying in the main hall, the Minister Fu Yi told him that \"Buddha\", so he sent Cai Wei and others to Tianzhu, ushered in Gaya Mori and Falun two Gao Yan, and brought many Buddha statues and Buddhist scriptures, with a white horse camel back to Luoyang, the emperor's deceived people changed their summer palace to the home to let the monks stay [69], translate \"forty-two chapters\". That is, now the white horse temple. Therefore, in the history of Chinese Buddhism, more than ten years of Hamming Emperor as a Buddhist introduction. Baima Temple became the first Buddhist temple in China. \"Forty-two chapter\". Later, Chu Wang Liu Ying used Huang Lao (early Taoism) and the new Duo (Buddha) to make a confidential rebellion, Chu Wang smoke, the emperor ordered Huang Laogao and Buddhism, but Huang Lao Road and Buddhism were in private secrets spread. Han Di, the Han Lingdi period, a lot of the Huang Emperor, Buddha's ancestral hall. Many Western Western monks in the Han Dynasty, such as An Shi higher Buddhist translatters have begun to introduce China to introduce Zen and the Buddhist classics into China. An Shigao has passed the most prestige translator in the early days of Buddhism. Its translated media is more sound, including \"people's own wisdom\", \"unusual and secrecy\", \"Yin Hold\", \"Decuting the Second Site\", \"Aiji Five Five Four Four Edition\", \"Twelve Breatus\", \"Eight Words\", \"Zen Method wants\", etc.\n\nThe Wei Jin Dynasty, Buddhism has a deeper popularity in the folk, \"Sui Shu. Economic Zhi Four\" records: \"Wei Huang Xiaoxiao, the Chinese Started by Buddha, shaving\" [70]. During the Nort-North Dynasties, Buddhism translators such as Morosh, Buddha Luo Luo came to China to make Buddhism greatly promoted. After the Xianbei Tuoba is in the main Central Plains, it will accept Buddhist thoughts, and use it to teach folk customs. Therefore, from Wei Taizu Tuo, the Wei Dynasty rulers have salute Buddha Shamen, Tuoba The same is true at the beginning of the place, and each trister is talking about.\n\nDuring the position of Northern Wei Temple, he was in place, and the north of the Yangtze River was unified. He first Chong Buddhism, after the influence of Taoism, he took the teachings, and privately, in the 440th, the year was Taiping Zhenjun. It is believed that the Buddhist system \"Xiqi is average\", \"for the world is full\" [71].\n\nTaiping Zhenjun five years, \u7981 \u738b\u516c \u4ee5\u4e0b \u4ee5\u4e0b \u81f3 \u79c1 \u4eba \u4eba \u4eba \u4eba \u4eba \u4eba \u79c1 \u9ad8In the seven years, Taiwu Diji arrived in Chang'an, and he saw that there was a weapon in the Buddha Temple, and it was also found that the wine, the treasure treasure, found that the monks and rooms were private, that is, the ban. [72]\n\nSitu Tri Hao was so extracted to the sky, destroying the temple (71). In March, the Emperor Xiaoman Shamen, and left the prince who left the flat city or waited to abolish the national Buddhism [73]. The Prince respects Buddhism, slowing the script, making it far away. [74] Therefore, the Quartet Shamen has escaping, the gold and silver Buddha statue and the script are secretly collected, only some of the monks are killed, and the Wei's temple building is more destroyed [75].\u5ba6 \u5ba6 \u5b97 \u7231 \u592a \u6b66 \u5e1d, Li Nan An Wang Tuo Kebo Zhen is an emperor, but also kills Bo Zhen, the minister Liu Ni, Yuancome, etc., the Emperor Omi, Taishu, and the Emperor, Qi Fu Dharma. Buddhism is still recovered.\n\nLater, Northern Wei split into North Qi and North Zhou, and the Gao Ye had ordered the deck. Beginning in Northern Monday, I also respect the Buddhism to Zhou Wu Emperor's swelling, so I have to explore the Buddha to the Buddha in the world, and the monk Taoist eliminated the civilians or arms, the Buddha statue camped money caused weapons. Later, after the death of Wu Emperor, Sui Wen Di Yang Jian resued Buddhism.\n\nThe Nanliang Dynasty Liang Wu Emperor Xiao Yan advocated the Buddhism and went home many times. In addition to their own Buddha, Liang Wu Emperor also vigorously supported the development of Buddhist career. In Liang Wu Emperor, \"Break Meat\" before the Buddhism, \"There is no broken meat method\" [76], Liang Wu Emperor believes that all Buddhist monks should comply with the Mahayan \"Dawei Nirvana\" does not eat meat [77], so The promulgation of \"breaking meat\" is prohibited from eating meat, and I also eat, I have done it, open the tradition of Han Chuan Buddhist vegetarian food. After the Han Bi Buddhism group began to comply with Van.com [78].\n\nSouthern Dynasties Since the Jin Dynasty clothes, the large number of monks are also transferred, and the Dharma is prosperous, and the most famous is the net Tuzong. Tiantai Zong is also developed in the South Dynasty. The emperor has built a Buddhist temple, supporting monks.\n\nZen Legend Generation Bodhi Mapoa Southern Song Dynasty, the Bank of Commerce Arrival arrived in Guangzhou, from learning to find the Hall, and then taught the disciples of \"Sangha Jing\", which is one of the Sangan. After the Liang Wu Emperor believes in Buddhism, so he is to Jiankang (now Nanjing, Jiangsu Province) and its discussion. At that time, Liang Wu Emperor won the Buddha law. Whether it is a temple, causing, the sorrow, it will not have a lot of effort, so it is only a good job, and I don't know that this is just a cumulative blessing, not the inner consciousness. Dharma was broken, told Liang Wu Emperor without merit, both parties.\n\nDamo knows that Liang Wu Emperor can't accept such advanced thoughts, so I will leave the south, \"a reed River\", in the mountainous wall of Shaolin Temple in Henan, waiting for the pass. After the pass of the second ancestors (487 - 593), Sanzu Yuliu (? - 606), Siupu Daoxin (580 - 651), Wuzu Hongle (602 - 675), Liuzu Hui Hui Can (638 - 713). He spread Sangagong to northern China, landing roots, becoming a unique martial art. But Zen is still not popular, and it has been in accordance with the Lifen, and the Tang Dynasty has a formal Chan Temple.\n\nTang Jianjun, the problem has been turned out one by one, but the Fu Yu, who is Tai Shi, believes that Buddhism and Taoism are violating the way Kong Meng's way, but the country is not good, so there is a order: \"Pseudoh, is a non-unknown, state Don't have a temple, stay thirty, all the people. Sino-Wude Nine years, Gaozu has promulgated the priest: \"The three of the Beijing Temple, the second place. The rest of the world will stay, Yu Si,\" Taizong led the soldiers to the Sui Yidu Life: \"Waste Road, Chengzheng Ni is a famous German hundreds, and the rest of the festival.\" Taizong successively after another three sessions. According to \"Continued Higher Biography \u00b7 Ming Gu Chuan\" record: Yuguan, Ming Gu, in Chenzhou, judge, and only thirty. According to \"Zhi Zheng Chuan\" record: the first year of the nuts, the sentiment of the book, the Royal Shi Du Yun, the Dharma, the Qing Dynasty. \"Fa Chong Biography\" records: \"The first year of Zhun, there is a private person to the criminal. When there is more than a fugitive, the capital is poised.\" \"French transmission\" also records: \"Tuanji three years, The world is binding to the privateness, no out of the person, smelling this.

From the front of the Buddha, there is a problem today, and today is all true.\n\nAfter the popularity of Buddhism, the impact of China's social, economic, cultural, and political all aspects made Han Yu feel the impact of severe drugs. He did not first solve the ideological problems from Buddhism. The external problem is solved. The book \"The Buddha Bone Table\" (\"Welcoming Buddha Summing Table\"), the Buddhist doctrine is unseaful, but the difference in the form of religious forms and the diligence of the life and death, it is indeed pair of agriculturalism and diligence. Nationality brings great impact and temptation. \"Customs Tong Jian\" Volume 24 \u3007 Remember: \"In the middle of the bones, the bones are allowed to stay in the third day, and they will send the temples, Wang Gong people's volunteers, fear, and dedicated festivals There is a burning arms to the servers. The Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Criminal Department Han Yu is cut, ... go to the table to be angry, show the prime minister, will add a little punishment. \"Although this case, although Han Yu is taught, it is temporarily calm. However, through his student Li Wei, standing in the Confucian position, retrieved the essence of Buddhism, rationalization and Confucianism, \"Since the Confucianism, on the one hand, Han Yu's turtlerance, on the one hand, in the new year of Li Wei Road, living in the realm of \"Jing Zen, Movement Confucian\", and they will be relieved and social events, and become the Journal of Song Ming. \"[79] [80]\n\nDuring the Song Dynasty, because many of the Dynasties of Wuzong Diwande, the Buddhism was disappeared. He went to the five generations of the north of China Zhou Shizong, and the world is united. The Buddha, and the Buddha is still casting money, and the monk Taoist is still ferrous or degrading. For civilians, the Buddhism is more snowing. In the Song Dynasty Buddhism, there was only the Zen and the pure land, and there was a slight Tiantai Zong, and a large number of Buddhism was lost, and they had to re-translate from India and the re-transportation of Korean Japan. The three have been favored by Zen, and the net Tuzong is in depth, Tiantai Zong is only attached to Zen. Although the Emperor Song Dynasty is good about Buddhism, when they are mainly tutorial; and Buddhism has been attacked by Confucian and Taoism, and Buddhism's Zen advocates clear-hearted perspective to oppose the monk believers to study the Buddhist scriptures, and the net Tuzong is in depth for many classics. It is also universal. The inheritance of Tiantai has long been broken. The scholar is only relying on their own understanding. In the face of Confucian and Taoist attacks can only be worthy of three homes to reduce conflicts. At Song Huizong, because the emperor Chongxin Taoist Lin Lingsin, Lin Lingsi originally Shami because of the teachings of the sneak drink, the arrogance to do the Taoist is said to repair the Rage faction, in order to retaliate Buddhism, Huizong ordered to change to Derse, Buddhism Tianzun, Bodhisattva, Rohan, Remitted. The monk dress should be the same as the Taoist; this order is some monk to commit suicide or is exiled. It is also the prince of the Prince's Qinzong invited the Western Regions to repair the tribute to Lin Linger. It is conquest that if Hu is won, the Buddhism will return Buddhism into the original look and remove Taoism. However, the Hu Yin of the Trichor was defeated by the Lake of Linger. I have been going to the floods, Lin Lingshen can't be saved, and the prince landed in the city to worship the four square water, Huizong ordered Buddhism to restore the original face, and do not have to be jurisded by Duo.\n\nIn the Southern Song Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty, the Japanese Golden Monks were actively studying Zen, but Buddhism passed Lin Lingsu's Taoism, and the two teaching in the folk misunderstandings were originally a family; the monks had only meditation, one in-depth Calling Buddha, no matter what these. However, Zen and the netizen, Zen can't afford to clean Tuzong, Zen \u50e7 believe that there is no need to go to the world, the heart is clean, so don't go to other worlds. The netizen of Zen Zen is unable to take off three, and repel the Zen unhappy Buddha statue, Zen is not a classic; and after the Zen gods, they are the mainstay of the Temple, such as Wuzu Temple, turned into Su Dongpo, Yandang The Shan Yan has turned into a story of Qin Yu and so on. The net Tang Zong and Zen have been the Ming Po Master of the Ming Dynasty, and the two arguments ended.\n\nThe rise of the Ming Dynasty and the Yuan Dynasty letter from the Demolition, and the red towel army was related to the white lotus, and Zhu Yuanzhang was born. Therefore, Ming Taizu established the Ming Dynasty to inhibit and utilize the mergers of religion, in addition to change the exam. Eightened the essay and revised the Taoist Taoist Taoist Method. And each of the emperor has to shave a monks; confirming the status of the three education, mainly hope to take this to compress the Monasi-Teaching and Malaysia and other religious organizations have changed again into the Anti-Dang, and I hope to use Buddhism. The power of religion and other religions to maintain social order, but strictly forbidden to participate in politics and the development of the \"Royal Food\", which has become the lack of spiritual innovation, and seeks from the general beliefs. As a comfort, the Northern Zhili soldiers rushed to use Zen thought and have created a well-known Luo Gu, and the non-born parents of Luo, which affected all folk sects.\n\nAfter the mid-Dynasty, the Buddhism was strengthened by the royal religious activities and the Confucian contradictions. This contradiction has prompted some of the people to strongly oppose the construction of the temple and publish the Buddha's speech. It is still the effort of Confucian political social philosophy and relying on the group of Si Dafu [81]. The change factors and contradictory sources, in the penetration of the public to the national regime, the royal specialization behavior, the people of the people, and some people's three-school cross-belief integrated, some officials believe that Catholicism is looking for new ideas . The public (sentient beings) asked God to worship the behavior of the Buddha, essentially the misunderstanding of Buddhism. [82]\n\nThe Ming Dynasty has the same difference between Tibetan Buddhism policy and the Buddhist policy of Han. One of its important differences is that the Ming Dynasty is closely related to Tibetan Buddhism policies and the Western Border Policy, and the Chinese Buddhist Policy is basically unrelated to the peripheral relationship policy. In addition, some Shi Dafu's \"Fan\", \"Tibetan\", and the degree of identity is inferior to Buddhism in the Mainland. Ming Dynasty, some emperors were \"spells\" because of the lama of Tibetan Buddhism, and they have special interest and thus causing criticism of Scholars to relevant policies. [81]\n\nPart of Chinese Buddhism and the branch, the Taiwan Buddhist system was passed down by the China Minnan area, and the secular belief system (which represents the rock and sorghum beliefs) for its major characteristics, with the jungle system mainly owned by the people (with four Dafa veins are representatives. During the war of Taiwan, the Chinese Buddhism Buddhism in China was introduced into the Jiangsu Zhejiang system, covering the original native Buddhist power, making the original local Buddhist system often misunderstand. Japanese Buddhism came from Japanese Buddhism, and a total of eight 14th Japanese Buddhist Party came to Taiwan. After the war, he withdrew from Taiwan due to political factors. After lifting the martial law, he returned to Taiwan to Hongfa. In addition, there is still a Tibetan Buddhism and the inner Buddhism. About 35% of Taiwan is a Buddhist, but its beliefs may be with other Taiwan folk beliefs such as Taoism, Confucianism or consistent road, and even have overlap with other emerging religions.\n\nFrom the Korean Peninsula, it has been rejected by the local gods, and the Suhe has played up for more than a decade of war with the Buddhist Buddhism. The leader of the final material was shot, Buddhism was only spread. In the safe era of Japan, the two sorghum, the sea and the most clear to China to learn Tutan and Tiantai Zong. Back to the Japanese Air Sea to create a true freewor to establish Gaoani as the fundamental road, and the most clearly established Tiantai Tianda Triao, which is still until Japanese Buddhism. Two businesses. Modern Meiji-dimensional emerging, disrupting Buddha, ordered the new Taogong Officer to restore Buddhism, and allows monks to be eating meat to eat meat, forming today's Japanese Buddhism. But Japanese Buddhism still has a monk who strictly presses the commandments. It is about 70% to 80% of the people in Japan. When the Japanese die, it usually holds a Buddhist burial instrument, so many Japanese Buddhists today are just in the form of Buddhists, only participate in the funeral and the ancestral ceremony.\n\nAfter China's introduction, the Buddhism in the Three Kingdoms and the Korean period, when Li Chenggui established North Korea, because Zhu Yuanzhao looked over the Gaoli Dynasty (Li Chenggui adopted Chongruo policies, causing Buddhism to fight, even sometimes It is considered illegal, and if there is no holiday, the monks must not enter Beijing, and the status of monks is at the bottom of the society. When I arrived in the North Korean, I would like to organize three thousand monks to resist three thousand monks, and I have a breath of the court. After entering the Seafood Retrocession, the Korean Governor's government lifted all kinds of prohibitions in Buddhism, Buddhism, and the Governor's government allowed monks to eat and marriage. At present, there are more than 20% of the Buddhists in Korea, compared with Christians [83], now \"Cao Xi Zong\" belongs to the Zen Gate, is the largest, most authoritative in Korea, the most authoritative, all walks of life. A relative. \"Cao Xongzong\" is extremely influential in Korea, which is considered to have the power of the South Korean election. Whether the President's candidate will be willing to go to the \"Cao Xi\" temple will be willing to visit the temple of Cao Xionzong after the new Korean president. In North Korea, due to the official relationship between the official Buddhism is limited.\n\nThe United States \"Christian Science Monitor\" Points on September 14, 2006, Buddhism pointed out that Buddhism has developed rapidly in the United States. It has believers 1.5 million. It is the fourth largest religion in the United States. One third of them is later to change Buddhism. And pointed out that one of the most attractive Westerners in Buddhism lies in that people think that the outstanding Buddhist masters like the Dalai Lama and a line of Zen are to contribute wisdom to the society, not what others believe in. \"[84] According to Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies In 2010, most American Buddhism lived on both sides of the country, about 75% of Buddhists lived in a population of more than one million, and California San Jose is the highest in the proportion of Buddhists. Zone, accounting for 1.25%. Many Buddhists are Jews. [85]\n\nEuropean intellectuals have been interested in Buddhism since the 1870s, such as Artist Arthur, Uncle, Nietzsche, and mystic, such as Helena Bravitzky, is affected by Buddhism. The European Buddhist Alliance is the largest Buddhist organization in Europe, which is estimated to have more than 1-4 million European Buddhists. The conservative estimation of the academia is more than 100 million. [86] [87] [88] [89]\n\nIn the early days, Buddhism is a period of the historical staging of Buddhism in the academic circles, refers to the period before the foundation of Buddhism to Buddhism to Buddhism.\n\nLegend has it for three months after Nirvana, five hundred Arun Have the first settlement, from Excellent wave to the law, A is difficult to come out, and spread in the way. The mainstream academic point of view believes that the title is gradually improved after the division is divided. However, the Buddha's era may already have an argument in the Ajima maicu (M\u0101t\u0157k\u0101).\n\nThe Buddhist Teacher has a fundamental split by two hundred years. Due to the difference between the commandments, the disorder is different, resulting in the era of the top part and the public. After that, it was divided again, and finally the 20 (or 18) part of the part.\n\nThe traditional Buddhist doctrine of Mahayana will be regarded as a small Buddhist Buddhism that onlys seeks their own salvation. However, there is no Buddhist teaching group that claims to be \"small\", \"small multiplication\" is the title of the big Buddhism to the ethics of other Buddhist paradis, and the objects of the beings are especially the pets, and they are said that everything is [90]. (At that time, the Buddhist sects had the use of the sect of the sect of the best, such as that all have parties, said that the department is unknown, it is a dark fruit, the \"Island History\" of the South Passage, said that the parties are thorns)\n\nSince the word \"small\" contains the meaning of derogation or secting, the academic community has gradually not used this word. [91]\n\nThe upper part of the Buddhism, Buddhist Zone, today popular in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Lauga, China Yunnan Yi people, etc., and some ancient India has existed in Bangladaji Dagang Mountains (and Moram, Nuram, India). State, Arunachal, Aunlona, \u200b\u200bis listed as the most basic bobics of existing Buddhist Buddhism.\n\nBecause of its Zi San Tibet, Bali is the Holy Deminger, so it is also known as the Balli Buddhism, Bali Buddhism. Because of its southern Southern Ceylon and Southeast Asia, it also called Nanchuan Buddhism; and the North Pass to Central Asia, China and Northeast Asia's North Biography is relative. Nowadays, the top department is Buddhism, from the Sri Lanka's surveillance, respectively, said that the temple is inherited. Nowadays, the top, Buddhism, from the Sri Lanka's surrounded, said the Basih Temple (Mah\u0101vih\u0101ra-Nik\u0101ya).\n\nMahayana Buddhism, Buddhist Zongpai. At the beginning, the mid-term Buddhism was circulated in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Japan, North Korea Peninsula, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, etc., became a Buddhism in Han Chuan. In the late, the Mahayana Buddhism was introduced into the area of \u200b\u200bTibet, Mongolia and Russia, became Tibetan Buddhism and visited parallelism.\n\nThe Mahayana Buddhism complies with the A Hanjing and Dajing Jing, and the teaching is self-rolland, which is divided into Buddha and is divided into Chinese view and the privilege (or think there is such as Tibetan School). The teachings are based on the three-lying and five rings, the four sacred, and the twelve causes, and I have a six-degree polish to practice Bodhisattva with a Buddha as the ultimate goal.\n\nFor one of the Chinese pass Buddhist Zongmen, it is passed on China, which is introduced to China since India. It is the same as the imperial man of Maitreya Bodhisattva, and the world is in turn, the world, Chen Na, the protection method, the sages, Xuanzang, peek, Hui Mark , Zhou. Zu Ting is the Shaanxi Dawen Temple, so Ci Enzong is also known.\n\nThe basic education of French is \"French Items\", which proposes \"three people\" based on this view.\n\nLegend has it in the way of the Buddha's heart in the Lingshan Fa, and the Buddha's heart was posted to Zen ancestors. After the Capricorn, Zenmen sent from the Capricorn, until the 28th generation of Zen Zongshi Bodhidda Mozhong sent to China. Its Acting is located in Wuzu Temple in Wuzu Town, Huangmei County, Hubei Province.\n\nDuring the North and South Dynasties, India's monks came to China to create China's Zen, advocate \"not standing in writing, teaching; directly refers to people, seeing sex into a Buddha\" method, has become the basic education of Zen. Zen believes that liberation is not outside, and there is no need to use classic guidance. The way is to be in the hearts of the human, as long as it can put down the persistence, let go of yourself, it is free.\n\nZen will use the \"Diamond Sutra\", \"Liuzu\", \"Yuanjue Jing\", \"Vivo\".\n\nIts practice method is mainly four Zen, including\n\nNine times the second four Zen four no-color set (4 Zen eight) is not a Buddhist unique, and there is a practice in the ancient Indian. However, the death of the Buddhism is alone, and Buddhism believes that nine times are unworthy, but they only have the Buddhist saints of Ana or Arrahan to enter, and the fourth Zen is the most suitable meditation for the practice of wisdom.\n\n\"Dazi Nirvana\" describes the Buddha in the arrest of the Galone Rooseo, first entered the nine times, and finally entered.\n\nAccording to Zen Legend, Bodhi Mo Mo is Zen ancestors (China), the second ancestors, the three ancestors, the four ancestors, the five ancestors, Lu Hong, there are two disciples of the show, Huilong, two According to one party, the Zen Master was honored as the six ancestors, changing the courtesy, and there were Northern Xiu Southern energy, and these two inherits were called Bei Zongchan and South Zong Zen. After experiencing a series of debates, I finally debated the victory in the slide conference in the slide conference. It became the mainstream of China Zen, \"Six Ancestors\" The word is scheduled to be. Huiliang no longer passes the clothes, so that all disciples are free to play, their sects have developed to the size of the five seven pieces, and it is great. Five seven schools, mainly in the stone, Hongzhou. In the case of the Hongzhou Road, Cao Cong, Yunmen, and the Human Dynasty are under the door of Shizhou Road:\n\nSince the Tang Dynasty, Zen is very prosperous in China. Zen thought itself has experienced a lot of development, and has produced a lot of influence on China's literature, art, and ideological culture, and passed into Japan, Korean Peninsula. Chinese character cultural circles such as Vietnam.\n\nThe broad pure land beliefs mainly include the Western Pure Land, Maitreya Pure Land Belief, the Pure Land Faith, Pharmacist Pure Land Faith, etc. The common point is that I hope to pass the Buddhas and Bodhisattva, from this world (turbidity), can enter The pure land where the Buddha is located. Therefore, the pure land belief is the form of beliefs that are particularly advocated in Buddhism. In the faith in many pure land, the Western Pure Land Faith is most prosperous in China, and has developed a \"net Tuzong\" in one of China Buddhism. The net land will be named after advocating the pure land method. The net geothepan is mainly belief in Amitabha and Western bliss world, and his ancestors are considered to be in the East Jin Huiyuan or \u6619\u9e3e, and the ancestor is awarded, good guidance, etc., and becoming an important force. . Its Australia is located in the Xiangji Temple of Shenheyuan, Guo Du Street, Chang'an District, Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, China.\n\nAlthough the source of the pure land thought is in India, it has become a sect in China. Its main content is to rely on forty-eight great willing, through the \"Buddha\", and become a genus of Amitabha by \"Buddha\". About the Buddha, including the \"God of Buddha\", \"Treat Buddha\" (\u5373 \u5373 \u4f5b \"(\u5373 \u5373 \u540d \u53f7), the academic community generally believes that the way to read Buddha is the early net Tuzong practice, and the Buddha is popular After the road.\n\nThe net Tuzong has a major impact on Japanese Buddhism, which not only passed the net Tuzong, but also derived an important sect called the Zhenzhou Zhenzong. There is also an influence on the thoughts of Japanese Lianzong and the true words.\n\nThe net Zongyi can be summarized as: \"Let's believe in Amitabha to save,\" I hope that the Nighta Buddha is known; \"I hope that the Navita is pure land, and the Guangsheng is all sentient.\" It means \"letter\", \"wish\", \"line\". I believe there is Amitabha, and I believe that he has sent forty-eight great wishes and has been successful, this is a letter. Then, according to the \"no amount of life\", it is willing to born to the Western pure land. Because there is a thirteen, including \"Live\", \"Separation\" and \"Run\", in order to ensure that it is born, it will be unbelievable, which is not chaotic, and this is \"line\".\n\nThe net Tuzong will also be dedicated to the pure land five passage: \"Amitabha\", \"Viewless Strong Strike\", \"Quasi-Quality\", \"Hua Yan Jing\" \"Pu Xian Bodhisattva\" \" \"Great to Bodhisattva Buddha Round Times\", \"Bring theory\" as a syllabus.\n\nThe net Tuzong can be divided into top, middle and lower three products in the middle, middle and lower three products in all generations.\nAnd the clearance Master also proposed that the net Tuzong practice needs to be based on the net industry, including: filial parents, feature teachers, child is not killing, repairing ten good industries; two are hosted three returned, unfair The triple bodhi heart, convinced that causal, read a big multiplier, persuaded.\n\nModern scholars believe that approximately 6, 7th centuries, secret education. Some people think that taught is a major Buddhist absorption of some ideological theories and practice methods of primary Poemon and sexuality. [92] The teachings and the larger Buddhism are also based on the three law printers. In order to hopes to become a Buddha, it is in the practice of the common way, in the centrifuge, Bodhi, \"Concerns\" Waiting for the practice of stopping, thus rapid accumulation of Ford and Wisdom.\n\nAt present, the Trin Buddhism of Han Chuan Buddhism is only retained in Japan, and local has been lost. Tibetan Buddhism is mainly mainstream.\n\n[Edit in Wiki Data] Traditional religious ritual:\n\nGod\n\nSecret society:\n\nTaoism is the local religion of Huaxia. Taoism thinking is from the Yellow Emperor (Huangdi School \". The earliest founders of the Taoist system is the Zhang Daolu of Five-Buchen (Tianshi). Worship Taoist Laozi is azu, which is the earliest to the primitive social period. The sacrifice, the ancestors and other worship activities, until the Spring and Autumn Warring States Period Absorption fairy, the \"five elements\", \"Yinyang\", etc., the \"five elements\", \"Yinyang\", etc., the \"five elements\", \"Yin Yang\", etc., after the Han Dynasty To the north and south director, through religious reform, gradually evolve into the current Taoist education.\n\nTaoism is a multi-god education that worships many gods. The main purpose is to pursue the longevity of life, and they have to be a fairy, and they will save people. It plays an important role in the traditional Chinese culture in the ancient Chinese, and it is actively developed in the modern world [1]. For the Taoist of the Battle of Warring States, the Taoist theory is just a philosophical theory. Taoism has absorbed its theoretical system with \"moral\" as the core concept, and the philosophers will be deactivated; but until the Han Dynasty is neutralized. Zhang Daoling was in Yizhou (in Today, Sichuan Province), Zhang Dao Ming Mountain was founded to create Tianshi Road, believe in Laozi as Tai Shang Lao, establish twenty-four treatment as a missionary area. The provinces of the north and south dynasties have gradually improved [2]. The Tang Dynasty Taizong Emperor was the same as Li, with the same name as the country, so he was the ancestors of Tang Rong.\n\nTaoism is \"Tao\" as the highest belief, and believes that \"Tao\" is the original Chinese in the Central Plains [3]. Taoism (including Taoist, Warlock, etc.) and Confucianism and Buddhism, \"Three Education\", for the main components of Chinese traditional culture, is to occupy the theoretical learning of the dominant position and seek ways to practice practicing to work [4] .\n\nNow, the Taoism, which is said, is based on the ancient Chinese religious beliefs, and inheritably attacked most of the religious concepts and repair methods such as Fangxiandao, Huang Laodao and folk God, gradually formed to \"Tao\" as the highest belief. [5]. It is mainly the main classics of the Taoist \"Morality\", and the main methods of cultivating the immortality, and the main methods of cultivating the immortals, the main methods of cultivating the immortals, the main methods of cultivating the immortals, and the pursuit of cultivation of the cultivation of the immortals. For the five kinds of food, the fairy medicine, the exemption, etc., refining and guidance, Naddan cultivation, and by the Taoistological instrument and its own law repair, etc., the common gods, the common gods are mostly Netan cultivation and merits into the trainer of the Taoism [6].\n\nTaoism is the religion of China's local soil. Its department and sacrifices can be traced back to the worship of the world, natural and ghosts, from the earliest and ghosts communication, the original religion gradually evolved the sacrifice of the merchant week.\n\nDuring the Spring and Autumn Warring States Period, the original religion has experienced significant evolution and divided into social and cultural knowledge. The hundreds of phones are especially, Confucianism, and the ink is \"the ink\"; the earliest and ghost gods communicate with the \u7b6e \u7b6e and the original period of worship, the yin and yang of the ghosts, the fairy home, the same time, all kinds of findings and \" The activities of Changsheng Not Old Drugs are commonly seen in history books. During this period, I gradually produced the initial Taoism Thought in Fangxiandao, Huang Lao Road.\n\nAt the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty, Zhang Daoling called the Southeast of the Southern Yizhou (in today Chengdu), \"I was a three-day Zhengfa, and I was a teacher\", thus created a positive or one (also known as Tianshi Road, Wu) ). In the Central Plains, there is also a Zhangjiao Road, which claims to \"the sky is dead, Huang Tian is standing\", and the people will fight against the Eastern Han Dynasty (the historical name of the yellow towel or yellow towel uprising). The appearance of Zheng and Taiping Road, marking Taoism begins to become a teachings with a strict ideological system and organization system. In this social context, the main founding character of the taught scriptures Zhang Daolu comprehensive traditional ghost ghost worship, the fairy thought, yin and yang surgery, and the witchcraft, and the Han Dynasty was gradually integrated. The Taoist Division has also formed at this time, and the Taoist religious form begins. [7].\n\nTaoism teaches mainly integrates from Daojiaology. Taoism and Taoist are different, because the Taoist is learning, no religious form; Taoism is religion, although the old man is the teacher, the Zhuangzi is the ancestral teacher, but his advocacy is not exactly the same, but more thanks to Han The early prevailing of Huang Lao, who is in the name of the Yellow Emperor, Laozi. The other origin of Taoism is to start in the Warring States, the Fangxiandao, which is surrounded by Qin and Han. Fang Xian Dao Branch (including guidance), bait, housing three factions. The airpage is Zun Pengzu, Wang Que, and Zausang is the beginning of the ancestors; the bait is born, and the security is born; the house is to be accomplished, and Zucheng is a representative. In addition, it can also worship the ghosts of Yin Shang.\n\nSome scholars pointed out that there have been many sects before the Eastern Han Dynasty, with the history of the history, the things of Zhang Ling, Zhang Lu, come on the road to teach the three father and son [Note 1], and \"Han Han\" The text is under: \"Zhang Luyi Flag. At the beginning of the grandfather, the passengers were in the middle of the city, and the Hemou Mountain was learned to make the characters to confuse the people. Since the jurisprudence, it is a rice flour, the thief. Mausoleum Heng, Heng Zi Zi, Lu Yuxi, the teacher. It came to the scholar, was named ghosts, the late sacrifice. Savings, the people, the famous people, the name of the people, do not listen Bullying. If there is a disease, but it is the first. All the insults of the sake of wine are passed on the road, the same pavilion, county rice meat to give travel. The amount of the vessel is abdominal, and the ghost can be sick. Crown First add three originals, then execute, do not set up the long, to make a sake of wine, the people's letter. The imperial court can't be discussed, I will lead Hang Ning Taizhong, lead [8]. \"\n\n\"Three Kingdoms \u00b7 Zhang Lu Chuan\" Liu Song, Yan Song's payment \"\u7565\" [9]: \"\u5e73 \u4e2d (\u5e73 is the Han Lian Nian, 172-77), the demon thief, three auxiliary Wei [9]. \"Guanghe Zhong (light and is the Chinese Emperor of the Han Di), there is Zhang Xiu in the East, there is Zhang Xiu, Hanzhong, and the corner of the people, the corner is the Taiping Road, which is cultivated as the five-buffalo [9]. , The teacher is a nine sticks, which is a congregation (curse) [9]. Teach the patient to smash, because the disease is drinking, the disease or daily heaner, then clouds this person; it or not, then In noticed, the repair is slightly related to the corner, and the calm room is added, so that the patient is thinking [9]; it makes people an argument, sacrifice the wine. Savings, the wine, the Lord, I have learned, the number is Regulatory, for the ghost, the Lord please pray for the patient. Please pray the law, the name of the book, the meaning of the sin, the thirteen, the day, the sky, the mountains; Water; the three official books. Make the patient's home rice five buckets to do, the singles, five bucquettes. It is not good for treating disease, but for the suspension, the little man is fainting, and [9]. The corner was scored, and the Ru is in the Hanzhong, because of its civil service, it is added. Teaching the bureaucrat, with rice is used to stop, and teach yourself, have a small person When the road is a hundred steps, then the sin is sin. It is also \"monthly order\", spring and summer ban, and forbidden wine. The flow moved in the land, did not dare to [10]. \"In\" derived \" In the record, the mist of Zeong Song thought Zhang Xiu was Zhang Heng. No matter whether the name is incorrect; but you can clearly see that the sects at the time is quite a lot; Wuli is the same as Taiping Road. It is only a fault to tributary; at the time of Taoism, not just Zhang Ling Zhang Lu family [10 ]. And said Zhang Ling, or say Zhang Lu, often in the \"Pseudo\" word [11], to attract other sects, it can be seen that it is not only a lot of faction, but also attacks each other. [10]. It also passed the passage of Zhang Daoling, called \"Yunxiao Seven Signs. Volume six fourth \":\" \"Zhengtang\", true one, big big name [10]. \"Zhengyi\", Tianshi is self-transportation: \"I am from too old, teach to be a new The law. The new person, the old, the new, the new, the name is truthful, learn from the evil, still use the old text, undertake the teaching, and there is no transformation. \"Also teach people to learn the fairy, all use the ancient The law. \"Wang Dynasty, after reimcoming the teacher, since the editor, the name\" Zheng a new exuberant \".\" From Zhang Ling's advertised \"new\", it is known that the old Sutra is more solid. Usually the religion is developing to a certain stage, it will be divided into a variety of sects; thereby confirming that Taoism is not invasive from Zhang Ling. Therefore, if the Taoism is not intended to be hitting [10]. Therefore, other Taoist branches are no longer claimed to be \"Taoism\" in order to distinguish it.\n\nTo the north and south dynasties, the Taoist fair has many, and the dismisions of the dismisions are still different. At this time, Daoguan and Buddhist Temple have developed a lot, and Taoism is extremely deeply affected, absorbs a large number of Buddhist astronomical, calculations, medicine, etc., and began to reform. Northern Wei Dao Shiqian absorbs Buddhist wheel back, and the concept of business causality, Zhu Tianshi, etc., and imperatives the Buddhist discipline and the Fa Conference, Trusteo, Tai Shang, the old monarch, has set the Taoist commandment and the smashing of obsessed with the obstacle, abolished \"Collective Yellow Chi\", \"paying five buckets into the road\", \"The surgery of men and women\" [12]. At this point, Taoism has established a more complete teaching group system and the fairy system, and the religious form has matured; Northern Wei Dao said as a national education, marking the state acknowledged that Taoism is a legal religion, and even to the Tang Dynasty Too Taizong Emperor Chongsiao (Liur) is The ancestors of the Tang Dynasty royal family (Li surname).\n\nHowever, the Taoist faction is discrete and has the case of mutuality. According to Wang Changyue, the Qing Dynasty, Wang Changyue said that the Taoist Queen Taoist Taoist Taoist Taoism has another religious reform, which impens a Buddhist five ring, eight rings, and Sham, the Biqiu, Bodhisattva Santan Rings, formulated five rings, eight rings, and the first real ring , The middle rings, Tianxian rande Santan quit, and the clerk must be subjected to the ring, and a Taoist is awarded to be awarded. The whole truth has become a deepest Taoist faction of Buddhism. Its Shenyi system also absorbed Buddhist Bodhisattva. These commandments are also generally complied with the whole Taoist.\n\nFrom the beginning of the Chuangzong, Tian Dynasty, Zhang Daolu, the \"Moral Scriptures\" of Lao Dynasty, will \"Tao\" and \"German\" as the basic belief [1]. Taoism believes that \"Tao\" is the original and master of the universe. It is omnipure. It is not enough, all things come from \"Tao\". And \"German\" is the embodiment of \"Tao\". The three clear gods is \"Tao\" initial personality, which also represents the three important processes of the cosmosphere, that is, the so-called \"Tao life, a life of the second, two students, three, three thousand things\" [13], three cleaning Birth of the world's universe and natural gods, these are called Congenital Respect (Tianzun), which is evolved in the road, which is both in the same day. Humans can achieve and have a realm of moving through certain cultivation methods. These people are called the next day, the highest scrap can also reach Tianzun [1].\n\nIn addition, Taoist Supreme God has other statements in different sectors in history, but the highest belief is still in \"Tao\". \"Tao\" in different ages, the highest god of Taoism. First, the Tianzheng is the highest God with Yu Qingyuan, and the other is the highest God of Qingling Bao Tianzun. The third is to the highest height of the Taiqing morality is the highest God. Finally, it evolved into theology theory of \"a three-clear\" in three integration. According to \"Nine Days God Chapter\", Taoism's theology theory believes that the three clear is \"Xuan, Yuan, start\" three gas.\n\nTaoist the teacher of Taoism, Zun, Lao Jun. Some people are ours in historical facts, and the teacher is called Zhang Daoling [10]. However, the mainstream of the Taoism believes that the teacher has always been a Too Shang Laojun, Yu Qingyuan Shi Tianzun Teacher, Shangqing Lingbao Tianzun representative, Taiqing Morality Tianzun delegation, Taoist teacher is Taoism Samuo, anti-Taoism classics, Yu Qing and Qing has always been the concept of martialization, and has not been entered. Only too clear into the world. In this regard, the teacher is naturally a Taiqing morality - Tai Shang Laojun.\n\nIn terms of self-cultivation, Taoism pays attention to \"People's Day\", \"People's Day\", \"Touching the Treatment, Don't Teach\", pay attention to \"inexhaustible\", \"return to the root\", \"deep root\", \" Long-lived, \"Ideck, I can not humiliate, I can have a long time\", \"\" Take the heave of the earth, and the argument of the hexagle, \"is infinite\", etc.\n\nTaoism is dead to die, and Taoism is reborn, and the pursuit of longevity is not old. It is considered that people's lives can be the Lord themselves, and they don't listen to the sky. As long as people are good at being good at practicing health, they can be long-lived, they have to be immortal. Therefore, many cultural methods are also produced: alchemy, taking, Turning, fetal interest, massage, guidance, room, grain, observoir, service, and chanting [14].\n\nMing Dynasty Taoist Zhang Sanfeng believes that the function of the Tao is \"Slim Person\", Confucian \"Walking Road\", the Buddha's \"Wu Dao\", Taoist \"Tibetan\". Taoist lectures refining fairy road, Zhang Sanfeng is based on the foundation of cultivating immortals, emphasizing only the essentials of Yin and Germany, kindness, and loyalty, Sin, all in humane, and naturally not far from Xian Dao. \"People can fix their body and mind, then really essential God gathered, Daddy's big virtue.\"\n\nTaoist theology can be said to be a mysterious religious student of Taoist ideas. It does not necessarily engage each other, and it is different, and it is quite a taste. However, the ancestors said that the ancestors called old, Zhuang, respect \"Morality\" (ie \"Laozi\"), \"Nanhua\" (ie \"Zhuangzi\") and many other Taoist classics, after all, absorbed the large amount of content of Taoist thought and play. In addition, it also photographed \"Easy\" and Yin and Yam, Confucianism, and the content of the ancient fairy, with the primer.\n\n\nTaoism and \"Taoism\" are often used in use. From a history, these two words have alleged a lot of different content, and they have been mixed into a talk; they still still have two people. However, if the Taoist understanding is created by Laozi, Zhuangzi, and the philosophical ideological geography of the Wei Jin was reinvenited, and the teachings were understood as the gradual formation of the two Chinese, and there were several developmental religions, then, although Taoism is theoretically The large number of elements of Taoist thought, even in the old man as the teacher, but the two still can't be mixed, and the theory of Taoism is the ideology. As a religion, Taoism has its gods and beliefs, there are people and organizations, have a series of religious rituals and activities, and its main faith is roughly clear. Taoism as a philosophical ideology, its thoughts and representative characters should be the most important content it is explained; after the Wei Jin, the inheritance of the Taoist thought, now it seems to be blurred, it is difficult to say, but it's a scholar literati The influence is still fraudless; from this perspective, the narrow \"Taoist\" refers to the pre-Qin period with Laozi, Zhuangzi's philosophical thoughts of the main representatives.\n\nSome scholars believe that Taoist thinking and religion may have a great connection. In the article \"Taoism's spirit\", I pointed out: \"I often have a doctor, the philosophical or metaphysics must have a predecessor, and this predecessor is likely to be a mysterious thoughts, or more specific points. Speaking, a witch. This religion is probably not very different from the later Taoism. Although the form is as completely unimpedied. This unknown ancient religion, we can temporarily call the ancient Tao [15].\n\nIn addition, the so-called long-lived, the Taoist people are not old, pursue into immortals, and they are in the like, and Laozi has not yet. The ideological ideological inside the Taoism is very complicated. There is also a situation in each faction, nor all the pursuit of longevity, pursuing a fairy, and the like.\n\nSee the Taoist character list.\n\nTaoism is a multi-god teacher, the highest god is the three definitions of Daozara (\"a three-clear three clear\"), that is, Yuan Shi Zun, Lingbao Tianzun and moral Tianzun, the moral Tianzun is too old, the old man [16] .\n\nTaoist ancestors believe that the Tianda has the concept of Jade Emperor, Hell and the world has its own concept, the land hall and the ocean as a heaven, and the main god of the three regions of the sky, the land, the sea is the three officials. Taoism has also developed a series of fairy officials in the Queen Government and Longwang Crystal Palace. Local gods series such as four-value Gong Cao, mountain god, city, land god, stove monarch, etc. [16], and absorbed the Xi Wang mother in ancient China ancient Chinese mythology, nine days. The fairy spectrum of Chinese Taoism believes is extremely compacted.\n\n\"Taiping Jing\" is divided into sixth class, Zhang Junfang, \"Yunxiao Qi\" Due, \"Shenxian\" is divided into ten levels, with the book, Taoism's Shenxian spectrum, the highest \"three clear\" \"Four Royal\", the lowest is \"Chenghuang\", \"land\". This is gradually set after long-term evolution [16]. Such as Mazu, Guan Emperor, Yue Wang, Shuangzhong, etc., this is the people of the folk, because the folk beliefs are included in the Taoist gods. Although Taoism is not for gods, but in order to spread the convenience, it will begin to shape the gods to be dedicated. In the large Taoist palace, there must be \"Tianzun Temple\" (or \"Sanqing Pavilion\") and \"Four Royal Temple\", as for other gods, According to the history of the road, the geography is not the same, and the \"three clear\" statues [16]. In addition, Taoist ancestors believe that people are also a small world, so various organs, such as hair, facial features, etc., and there are corresponding mechanisms, such as three corpse and Geng Shen.\n\nMany people in today's \"Feng Shen Bang\", this kind of gods belong to the wild history of novel, with a big difference with Taoism records, so most of them are Lingshan School, all are not orthodox Taoism.\n\nThere are many Taoist internal martial arts, and the names are different due to the dispatch standards.\n\nThere is a positive (Zhu Lingling), the full truth (Wang Chongyang, the ancestral teacher), the whole Southern Nanzong (Zhang Bo, Zeng, Zeng, Zhang Qingzhi), Taiyi (Zu Mo Cave 1) Five major parties, and Tianshi, Queen, Lingbao Road, Qing Tao four schools. There is also morality, congenital, Lingbao, Zhengyi, clear, patent, Yutang, Tianxin Baxi said.\n\nThe most influential in modern times is that the people and Dan Dingpai are divided into pure religions, mainly divided into five factions [17]:\n\nThe official assignment of Taoism is generally considered to be started in Song, Yuan. There is more than 7 big schools in Taoism history [18]:\n\nAfter the Ming Dynasty, Taoism was mainly divided into two orders of the whole truth and the whole truth. All other sects were summarized under these two sects. Now Beijing's Baiyun's view has the \"Trual Party Total Book\", and the listed school is eight7th. In fact, some are only the renewal of the spectrum, not independent. In addition, according to the tutorial, it should be a 36-day education and 72 to teach, with a total of 108 sects.\n\nTaoism, the \"Moral Scriptures\", Zhuangzi's \"South China\" as an important classic, the Taoist Taoist \"Three-hole Scriptures\" in the South-North Dynasties, collecting the books of the past, not only including philosophy and Taoist theory, but also Including works in alchemy, health, treatment, and Qigong. Describe Taoist Records, Zhai.Mw-Parser-Output Ruby.zy {Text-Align: Justify; Text-Justify: None} .mw-parser-output ruby.zy> rp {user-select: none} .mw-parser -Output Ruby.zy> RT {Font-Feature-Settings: \"Ruby\" 1; Padding: 0 0.1em; User-select: None} \u91ae (ji\u00e0o), the classics of the technology, the classics of the practice, \"orthodox Tree\", \"Tang Zang wants\", \"Wanli Continued Tang Tibet\", etc., these places have an impact on the political, economic, cultural and technologies of ancient China. At present, it is mainly widely circulated in the \"Orthodox Tang Tang\" in the Ming Dynasty, and the classics of the past Division is included here. The number of Taoist scriptures is very large, and the main classics of all sent are different [19].\n\n\"Zhou Yi ginseng\" is the earliest Danjing, called the ancestors of Dans, and \"Bao Pu Zi\" is also the basic classic of Taoist Dandi. \"Taiping Jing\" and \"Laozi\" are also the main classic in the early days of Taoism. The \"Huang Tingjing\" and \"Shangqing Dalong True Scriptures\" are the main classics of the Shangqing, and Mao Mountainpa is also very heavy. \"Scriptures\" and \"three emperories\" are the main classics of Lingbao and the Sanhuang. \"Yinjing\" and \"Changqing Stilery\" are also very important scribes in Taoism. It is the script of Taoist who must hunt. In addition, \"Yuhuang\" and \"heart screening\" are also one of the daily homework of Taoists [20]. After the Northern Song Dynasty, there was a classic such as \"Wu Zhen\" and \"Jin Dan four hundred words\".\n\nAlthough the Taoist Nanzong is a part, although the Taoist, the nation, the department is mainly, but the Northern Song Dynasty will also advocate the three education and one reason, cultivate NORD.\n\nTaoism Beizong's fullness is more advocating three education, refining the whole god, mindful, combined with the rules, and \"moral scriptures\", \"filial piety\" and \"all kinds of\" \"three classics, advocate\" Filial piety and pure.\n\nTibetan is the total collection of Taoist boutiques. It is a must-have, collects, and organizational structures, and multi-channel books that have arranging many classics. Including the \"San Cave Directory\" in the Nankai, \"Kaiyuan Tang Tibet\" in the Tang Dynasty, \"Da Song Tiangong Treasure Treasure\" in the Song Dynasty (\"Yunxiao Seven Signs\" is the fine version of the \"Wanshou Road\", Jin Dynasty \"Xuan \"\" Xuandu treasure \"in the Yuan Dynasty, the\" orthodox Tang Tibet \"and\" Wanli Continued Treasures \"and\" Wanli Continued Treasures \"and\" Wanli Continued Tibet \".\n\nTibetan classics are divided into three-hole four-proclaimed twelve. The three holes are \"Cave Real Ministry\", \"The Ministry of Cave\", \"Dong Xuan\", all classic internal accommodation is the three categories.\n\nThe earliest, Taoism originally did not have much clearance and discipline, did not ask for vegetarian food, can not help but drink alcohol, you can get married. For example, the Yellow Emperor of Chengxian is drinking alcohol, marry his wife. In ancient times, the sky is used with cattle, sheep, \u8c55, and drinking, so early Taoism is clearly not banned.\n\nLater, due to the introduction of foreign Buddhism, the Taoism changed, which made some scriptics in Buddhism. Taoist discipline is some guidelines for some binding Taoist ideology. It was founded by North Wei Wei, because the road to Zhang Daoling was not strict. In the Northern Wei Dynasty, the Taoity of the Northern Wei Dynasty was all integrated, and the faculty was mostly the father. In the Royal DPRK, I will abolish the collective yellow red and pay the five bucket. Taoist the commandments have different content in accordance with different sects. Generally speaking, the alliance of the whole faction is strict. The content of the commandment is not to kill, you must not drink alcohol, you must not steal, you must not be evil. The commanders must be observed, and the Queen Sanyi Rings is in the Qing Dynasty Baiyun Guan Gaoxao Wang Changyue in the middle of the \"\u9274\", the Qiu Mi's new road taught traditional commandments, which imitation Buddhism Shami, Biqiu, Bodhisattva, the development of the truth, the middle , Tianxian ring. Moreover, there must be a trip to a rings to count the public. According to the ruling, the commandments can be divided into tops, China, the next product. According to the number of \"three rings\", \"five rings\", \"eight rings\", \"ten rings\", \"10th rings\", etc. [1].\n\nIn addition to the quotation, there are also Taoism rules, which is the punishment after the Taoist criticism. The specific regulations are different, and the provisions are different.\n\nTaoism religious activities are very intense, often affecting each other with folk beliefs, so it is also known as \"speaking\" as \"Tao\".\nMainly divided into two major categories [21], Taoist's own practice and Taoist ceremony, including Taoism,,, \u91ae, \u7b26, \u7b26, \u7981, \u9690,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, , Pray, housing, gods, grave, feng shui, divination, etc.\nIn addition, there are many tangues. For example, in the past, defending a one, some thinking, the valley, etc., and the effect of health is also classified as Qigong.\n\nIt is generally believed that the mountain (fairy), medical, life, Phase five categories, and the post-three articles are also classified in surgery. The basic composition of the five, it is from the easy to classify, and it is easy to cover the time and space. The universe is all-in-one and the mutual opposition, such as winter to spring, summer to fall, old life, old life and many more.\n\nThe Taoist's own practice became a Taoist, including Netan, Dan Dan, taking food, and room.\n\nNetan refers to the use of gas, guiding, breathing, and refining Dan in the body to achieve long-lived purposes. Old Dan and Naddan have the same language, but the meaning of the referring is completely different, such as a furnace that compares the human body as burning refining Dan Pills, but theory still has communication. In ancient times, Most of the teachers and apprentices, how to be in the mouth, and outsiders are difficult to understand. The Sandanian field of the human body is called \"three yuan\" is the statement of Taoistin's internal Dans. [19]. \"After the chaotic, there is a three-yuan gas of the heavens and the earth, generate people, grow thousands of things. People are also the three focal, San Dian, with health shaped, with god of life [20].\" Yuan \"refers to the fusion, the vitality, and Yuan god.\n\nOld Dan refers to a mineral and drug such as burning alchemy sand, mercury, and the production of people who can make people grow old. Modern science believes that these Dan medicine are mostly poisonous. The ancients also have many examples who take improper death, and the ex-Dan is also considered a pioneer of modern chemistry [1]. In addition, exemptions can also refer to alfine or Taoist spells, Ray, etc.\n\nThe Taoist ceremony is collectively referred to as \"Ramada Ke\", and Zhai is a clean meaning, and it means praying, also known as the road. Taoism sacrifices the gods, because they think that God is clear, there is a bathing dress before the sacrifice, no room, do not drink, do not eat meat, and make fast. The sacrificial activity is called \"\u91ae\", and the Taoist ceremony has learned many Buddhism in the development process (China Buddhist ceremony has also learned many Taoist content in the development process). Taoism believes that through these rituals can go to the disaster. Divination is also part of the ceremony, including filters, lottery, measure word, etc.\n\nAfter the foundation of the northern part of the Jin Dynasty, he went to the current system. The university system is preceded by the whole truth, and there are many highways for their representatives, the most famous people are the Saffie of the Tianshi.\n\nTaoist believers called the CHR (unreasonable), Qingxin, good man's letter, etc., is known as the Sanheng Five Rings, the customs disciples are respectful to each other, the brothers, teachers, Taoists, a couple, the same, the same party, etc. Due to the long-term mutual impact with the Chinese biography, the two teachings are similar or identical.\n\nIf you have more, you will be called more, and you will be honored, the long, Taoist, Taoist (female), Taoist, Daoye, the real person (the Lai Xian class, the immortal, the immortal, the cactus), highway, etc. High, high-spirited, Gao Shi, Dade, Bier, Feather, Feather, Yutu, Huang Crown (Men), Female Crown (or Female Huang, Women), Dry Road (Men), Kun Dao (Women) and Dao Xiao (the young man who has just watched). According to the true truth, the correct Taoist, the whole trao, the height of all sings; the whole Zhai Taoist said the Master, Zhengyi's sideline said it is called the Taoist; some Taoist is married to the wife, and also known as the fire Taoist, commonly known as Lianjiandao; engaged in funeral instruments, said Wu Tao Taoist; all true refining teachers, \u5e08 (unrivated), Master (have been rescued), lawyers (Abba), master (Division).\n\nTaoism hosts the actions to call [22] or abbot, is a meeting with the party (office) as a member of the party; the following general management is the supervisor; the reception believer, the guests call the guests.\n\nZhang Ling and later said that the Tianshi, the whole school also said that he claimed to be a teacher.\n\nTaoism Music is one of the important components of Taoist culture. Daole is not only a long time and secret, but its melody is ancient style, combined with the mutual combination of religion and art [23]. Duo is common in the temple, the day and night class, sing, all kinds of race, Zhongyuan Puru, large legal conference, etc., or believers play on various funeral, worship and daily gods, but also Taoist, Master must have a health, often played in temples, vegetarian shops, tea art hostess, religious art stores daily, and monodies are often used in meditation, practice Qigong Road, improve the realm of the soul [23].\n\nTaoism activities are mainly in the uterus [24].\n\nTaoist religious buildings are known as the uterine, which is relatively late, and it is not too early to come to Tang. Taking the history of forming and evolving, they can see them to adapt to the needs of Taoist organizations and development, and development. It is generally believed that early Taoism religious buildings are mainly Jing (quiet, quiet room) and treatment, and some have a famous room, and it can also be called a museum. The so-called Jingjing or Quiet, the static chamber set up by the home is intended to isolate others in home. \"The home of the house, the Jing room is the reason. It is not even the house. It is clear, no remaining object. Open the door, do not touch. Sprinkle the exquisite, often Fragrance burners, incense lamps, chapters, books. \"It can be seen that it is to distinguish between sacred and general residents, and the boundaries of the priests and customs [24].\n\nIn short, the uterus is an embodiment of Taoist concept and is a symbol of Taoism. It has strong iconic, so that people can know that it is a tributical religious place, with other religions such as Buddhism, Christianity is different [24].\n\nIt can be divided into two kinds: temple refers to the believous of folk beliefs, dedication and ascending place; Taoism is concerned about the contest, offering a variety of religious rituals and living locations, near Mountain Dachuan, and big cities in.\n\nThe three yuan festival is the Daqing Day of Taoism. The three yuan festival is the birthday of the \"Three Emperor\", and the Tianshi Birthday is the Employment Festival. It is a blessing day of the Tianshi. It is necessary to hold a blessing to the forefront; the official birthday is the Sino-Yuanyuan Festival, for the official sin On the day, I want to Pufu Sony; the water official birthday is the next yuan festival, and the day of the water officials, please disaster disaster disaster in the fortune. The Tang Dynasty Three Yuan Festival was banned by the emperor. In the first month of the first month of the first month of the top 10, July 15 is the Sino-Everbright Festival, October 15 is the next yuan.\n\nTaiwan is a Taoist festival with the new year of the lunar calendar. Singapore and other places are Taoist festivals in February 15 (the birthday of Daozu).\n\nTaoism's political, economic, philosophy, literature, art, music, painting, architecture, medicine, pharmaceutical, health, and geography of the Taoist cultural circle have different degrees of impact. In addition, it also has deep impact on the thinking, ethics, ethics, folk, national relationships, cultural characteristics of East Asia.\n\nTaoism has a different degree of impact on all aspects of Chinese culture.\n\nSome sectors in Taoism have passed some martial arts and Qigong, such as the famous Wudangpai in martial arts. It is said that martial arts inherited in Most Taoist mons on Wudang Mountain. Taoist martial arts is different from many martial arts, paying attention to being successful, and the latter manager fully reflects the Taoist Treatment. Among them, martial arts rows like Tai Chi, have gradually become a daily fitness activity. Taoist enthusiasm is also a big genre in China. Many of the cultivation methods of all truths are Qigong, the exploration and development of Qigong, which contributes great.\n\nTaoist health also inherited and developed the content of Chinese traditional medicine \"Yellow Emperor's Internal Classics\". In addition, many people have worked for medical skills, which contributes to traditional Chinese medicine, such as Ge Hong, Tao Hongjing, Sun Si, etc., there is a tree in Chinese medicine.\n\nTaoist alchemy has an important impact on the invention of gunpowder.\n\nMany important cultural characters in history are Taoist. One of the Shengwang Yizhi of the Jin Dynasty is a trust. The big poet Li Bai in the Tang Dynasty was also a devout Taoist, once traveling all over the country, seeking Xian Dynasty, and even refining Dan, and he was accepted. This experience gives him a very important impact on the individuality of poetry creation and even a lifetime. Li Bai has been in Chang'an, and is recommended by the Taoist and beliefs of Tang Xuanzong. In the process of finding the fairy, he swims all over the five mountains and brought him a lot. Material. The idea of \u200b\u200b\"immortal\" and \"feather\" in his poems are often appeared. Tang Taizong built a \"Tai Shang Laojun Temple\" in Laozi's hometown; Tang Gaozong's respect for the old man is \"the Emperor of Too Tung Xuanyuan\", and believes that Laozi is the ancestor of Li Tangzong. The Tang Dynasty monarch has claimed to be the descendants of Laozi, and also follow the old people as the ancestor, and the sacrifice is a sacrifice, and also to the Emperor of the Tzu. At the same time, the court officials must practice \"morality\", and the \"moral scripture\" Scope of the imperial examination [25].\n\nAlthough the \"Journey to the West\" in the four major classical literature and literature is the story of Tang Yan and other four people to go through the scriptures, but the book uses a lot of Taoist proprietary concepts such as the heart, Itali, the gods, and Yuan god. Wait, I also constructed a Taoist god of the Emperor as the core, an official system.\n\nThe most famous novels, which are completely tongue-based, have to be \"sealed the gods\". The Shang Zhou War I told in the book, which refers to the two religious intercourse and interlimases of Taoism. All roads and magic weapons, which appeared in the book, belong to the intermediary and teachings system.\n\n\"The Emperor\" in China is the god of the Arctic Star. During the Tang Dynasty, Tang Gaozong used the Tiam Emperor's title, and he called two holy days from the heavens. Gao Zong decided to build a montage and sent his daughter into the Taoist Taoist. In other words, Taoism is in the strong implementation of Tang Taizong and Tang Gaozong, it can be said that it has become a national education in Tang Dynasty [25].\n\n\n\nHong Kong Taoism inherited the basic tradition of China's Taoism, and developed some features different from China's Taoism. [26] Compared with the long development history of Taoism in mainland China, the history of Hong Kong Taoism is no longer. Due to the territory of the territory, there are many Luzu Dao Tang in Hong Kong, and the Zhengzi Tao Hall and congenital road hall are incorporated from Guangdong to the Republic of China, and its incoming and development is only more than 100 years.\n\nTaoism has passed to Hong Kong at the Southern Song Dynasty, but the main source of modern Hong Kong Taoism is the folk emerging religion introduced in the late Qing Dynasty. Hong Kong Taoism has risen in the second half of the 20th century, which is the result of jointly organizing the original civil emerging religion. [27]\n\nDue to several transactions of the Chinese mainland regime since the late Qing Dynasty, as well as the cause of war, civil chaos and economic damage, Hong Kong under colonial rule became the harbor of Guangdong people's refuge, and also gave a Taoist group in Guangdong, helping the belief. A rare opportunity for the preservation and development of the scriptures and the CDM. Not only that, the Hong Kong Taoist group not only enters the form of organizational form in Guangdong to Hong Kong, but also develops to become a Taoist organization with modern urban characteristics. [28]\n\nUnder the efforts of more than 30 households, in 1961, the Hong Kong Taoist Federation was allowed to register the community. In 1967, it was allowed to register as a limited company (Responsibility Mission), exemption from profit tax and interest tax, and specialized for \"limited\" \"Word. The establishment of the Hong Kong Towards, improved the status of Taoism in Hong Kong, and aggravated the components of Taoism in Hong Kong society, Hong Kong Taoist entered a new development period.\n\nUnder the efforts of the Hong Kong Road, the Hong Kong Taoist Teggress was held in 2001 to 2010. Most of Hong Kong Daozang is the main Run Zu, followed by the main Guanyin. However, Huang Daxian is the most familiar Taoist god of Hong Kong people. Hong Kong Daochang Lin stands, among the meta colleges, the Punta Xianpu, Qingxiao and the names of the mortar garden are high, and there are four major palays in Hong Kong [26].\n\nHong Kong's Taoist group has spared no effort to contribute to the development of cultural education, social welfare charity, and build a number of schools, clinics, and nursing homes. [29]\n\nJapan is neighboring countries in China, and its ancient civilization starts late, but due to the influence of continental culture represented by China, it is very fast. In ancient China-Japanese exchanges and cultural exchanges, Taoism has also played an important role. Taoism also passed the series of Taoist culture such as Geng Shenxiao to Japan, making the belief system of the Emperor and the establishment of many Taoist elements [30].\n\nWhether Chinese Taoism is incompatient in Japan, there are two opposite opinions in the Japanese academic circles. One is to believe that the Japanese ancient government refuses to teach Taoism, the \"Tang Dahe Shangdong Junchi\" and \"Tang Datong\" and \"Group Book\" in the \"Tang Dynasty\" and \"Group Books\" are clear [Note 2]. Another opinion, \"Taoism as the organization of religion, its academic, Taoist, Taoism, etc., did not come from Japan, about this, currently no history, but Taoism acts as a thought to Japan, you can It is already a fact that it is difficult to negate. \"[32]. Taoism spreads in Japan, there is no teaching group to teach in the form of establishment of Taoism and Taoism. However, in the past 2 century BC, Taoist thought spread from the Korean peninsula from the Chinese character culture circle to Japan.\n\nIn the past 5th century, there were a large number of people in Ren De Tianshi, and there were a large number of people from the centrally located in the peninsula and the Yangtze River Delta region of China, they brought continental culture [33]. In Nara, Ping An Era, Japan uses a \"tray\" similar to folk custom from the Korean Peninsula or the Chinese mainland, and the Tang Dynasty, the Tang Dynasty, the ethics classics that returned to China and study abroad, accepted it. Chinese character idiom or knowledge, in part, in the Tang Song Dynasty, the Taoist beliefs, forming a Taoist form, and the Taoist form of the Yangtze Times has different, to the Yangtze Times, Japan accepts Zen monks, The \"good book\" in the Ming Dynasty and other people are teaching. These \"good books\" are beginning to accept the \"tray\" of Japanese people's national moral awareness, which also have a bumper and a big name support. Due to the development of typography, these \"good books\" continue to publish, and the general public is easy to see. Therefore, the impact on Japanese general society is also different from the past [34].\n\nIt was approximately in the seven century, Taoist Shenxian Changsheng Thought and Square have passed the Japanese. Japanese students have studied Taoism in China and bring Taoist classics to Japan. From the peace era, Taoism defending believes in Japan is quite popular in Japan [35]. \"Ancient Missions\", \"Japanese Book Ji\" also recorded ancient Taoist thought, Japan's earliest history book mainly explains the \"View\" and \"Emperor\" several terms. The Tianwu Emperor of the Flying Bird Age uses the emperor as the monarch as the monarch. The real words of Japan's awareness of the mountains to practice (the BRO fighters are arrested) and the fourth paragraph 4 of the Bao Puzi (the Lin Bing \"is almost the same [36].\n\nNorth Korea teaches in the 7th century in the Korean peninsula. In 624 (Tang Dynasty, the Seven Years of Tang Dynasty), Gao Rong Rong, who was invited to teach Tang Gaozu hoping. Tang Gausu Li Yuan is in the seven years of Wu De, the criminal department Shangshu Shen Shu An Changjun is Wang Gauli Wang, the Liaodong County, and will still talk about the Tianzun and the Taoist. Thousands of people [Note 3]. In the following year, Gao Ji Rong Li Wang also sent people to the Law of Tang Xuehua [38].\n\nHowever, the Taoism in the Korean Peninsula has not yet formed a teaching group [Note 4], the royal family is mainly regarded as the religion of the country, and the civilian people will be combined with folk beliefs, which is integrated into folk beliefs or others. Religion [Note 5] gradually did not know anything, and people did not think that the Taoism of folk faith was a foreign religion [39]. Before the introduction of China, Taoism has existed the fairy thoughts, the mountains believe, the spirit, the local custom folk beliefs, the spell, astronomy, astrology, the squid predicts, etc., it is believed that these religious cultural forms and China's Taoism has the same Sex or similarity [Note 6]; North Korea does not have a complete Taoist shape like Chinese Taoism; can not regard Korean cultural mid-education cultural elements as a foreign culture, emphasize the research from the main position to study the Korean culture Taoist nature. But no matter what, the historical material can prove Taoism in the spread of ancient North Korea and its impact [40].\n\nAfter the 1990s, South Korea began to organize [Note 7] and established contact with the Chinese Taoist Association [40].\n\nTaiwan Taoism has basically coming to Taiwan with early Han people to immigrate [41], from the Qing Dynasty, which has been enjoying the civil society with high religious freedom, and it is still booming during the period of time. In the early days of the Japanese government, the Japanese government implemented the \"Old Temperature\" policy, that is, respect the old habits of Taiwan and not interfere with traditional religion. In the late birth, due to the mining civilian policy, attempted to change the Taiwanese people's thoughts, Taiwan, Temple, Temple, and the private education group in guardianship and safeguarding people's safety [42], the people in the Temple Will boycott the Japanese government, so the emperor civil policy vigorously enforce the Taoism to change the Buddhist beliefs, which leads to the current Buddhism in Taiwan, but Taoism still has a warm flourishing style. After the war, the era of martial law, the national government banned the gathering parade, so the people can only apply to the government agency with the name of \"Celebrate National Day\", \"Celebration President, Vice President,\". In the Taoist Master, Taiwan's early mountain line is a red head. The sea line is the Taoist, and the Qing Dynasty in the Qing Dynasty in Taiwan has also established the Southern Lingbao School and the Zhengshi, and the Republic of China established the Chinese Republic of China Road Church and Taoism Too many, Taiwan Taoism has changed, but the people don't know how to teach system, the people 's heart has always been the main Taoist, Master and Jianyi and other concepts and customs are more depressed. Although the department is not the same as other places in China, the inheritance of Taoism has been developing in Taiwan.\n\nAfter the Republic of China, the Taoist the leaders advocated the establishment of the Taoist church. Due to the domestic warlords, they did not make substantive altitude, and the Republic of China was in the second year of the Taoism, and the Qing Dynasty, and the Qing Dynasty, the church, the anti-war military And the sleep, the Republic of China, the Sixty-three generations of the Han Dynasty, the sixty-three generations of teachers Zhang Enzhen restructured, and ZHANGANY Tianshi combined in Taiwan for forty years in the Republic of China, Zhao Jiayu, Xiao Tianshi, Ma Wei, Gao Yue, Jiang Zhou, Li Yun step and others set up a Taiwan provincial church, the foreign representative of the church, and after the introduction of Taoist affairs, it was established a national sexy church in Taipei in February 13, May 13, and the name is a church of the Chinese Republic of China. Publicly sixty-three generations of Tianshi Zhang Enzhen is the first chairman, so far to the eleventh. Taoism is now a major religion in Taiwan. On January 28, 2000, the Interior of the Republic of China announced the first day of January 1 to Taoism Festival. It is the only religion in many religions in Taiwan and is also the only religion in the history of the modern Taoist. Big things [41].\n\nTaoism was earlier in the end of the Eastern Jin Dynasty, and the five bucket Sunne had failed in the Jiangnan launched the uprising. And Vietnamese Li Lin helped Lu Tun to attack the city, and went to the water after failure. After Wu Chao, Vietnam has established Ding Dynasty, forever, Li Dynasty, Chen Dynasty, Hu Dynasty, and afterwards. During this time, China and Vietnam's relationships have been closely related, and Taoism is incorporated with immigrants [43].\n\nDing Chaowang is in the second year of China (China Northern Song Dynasty Kaibao for four years, 1997) once gave the leader of Buddhist Second Education, \"Taoist Deng Xuanguang\" [44]. When I arrived at Ding Xian, when I took a troops, I also went to the \"Tianzun Cave\" in Ningping, and the gods of God. Afterwards, the world, change \"Tianzun Cave\" is \"Anguo\". The Emperor of Li Dynasty was in the fourth year of the year (China Northern Song Dynasty, 992), once \"Xuan Huishan Taoist Chen Ms.\" [44]. Mr. Chen means Chen Wei. But according to China's history book, Chen Yu seems to have not arrived in Vietnam. At least the record of the History of Vietnam, Chen Yusheng is spread through the world, and the emperor of Li Dynasty is not called. Li Dynasty Chongxin San Education, Li Taizu is in place, and the Taoism will be honest to the palace, and the priest has a Taoist. When Li Taizong, Li Taizong, Taoist Chen Huilong also made a \"heaven\", got a pet, and gave the Royal clothes. Li Shenzong Tianzhangbao three years (China South Song Shaoxing five years, 1135), Shen Zong once went to Wu Yue Guan, \"Qingcheng Jin Yin Sanzhao\", allegedly recorded the first record of Vietnamese history on Vietnamese Road [43].\n\nVietnam is widely circulating the belief of true Wu Emperor. True Wu Emperor, ie Xuantian God [Note 8]. Xuan Tian God, is sealed by Song, Yuan, Ming and other generations. There are many uterus and gods of the north and central Vietnam. West Lake Scenic Area in Northern Hanoi City has true martial arts. True martial arts, also known as the town of martial arts, also known as the turtle [43].\n\nAfter the 16th century, the south of Vietnam gradually developed. After the Rubrise of Riche, Li Shi's regime fully utilizes the pre-masters of officials and the people who arrived at the evading rule, and rewarded the cultivation. In the future, there will be an overseas Chinese from Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi and other places to move in Vietnam. In the main city of Chinese gathered in the southwestern part of Ho Chi Minh City, some Chinese grooming halls and Taoist utershings are still continuing. The Suicheng Hall, which was built by the Chinese in Guangzhou, Guangdong, was created in the eight years (1828). There is a main hall for the Hall of Wall, the Dragon Mother, the Golden Flower Niang, the Demoni Dynasty. Since the Sixin Hall is mainly the goddess, it is called \"female temple\" by Vietnamese people [43].\n\nThe Yan'an Hall built by the Chinese in Chaozhou, Guangdong, founded in 1902 (Guangxu 28). The hall has a main hall to serve the Shengdijun, and the Ford's master, Wenchang Emperor, the wealth star, and the Virgin of the World. Since the privacy of the Yi'an Hall is the main male god, it is called \"Men Temple\" by Vietnamese people [43].\n\nTaoism also affects local native religions - Mother Taoism and Gao Taoguan [43].\n\nThe culture of Ryuques is greater by China and Japan. From religion, there are both believers of Buddhism and Ryukyu, and there are many believers of Taoism [45]. Many people teach the gods such as Mazu, Guan Gong, etc. have many believers in Ryukyu, and they are absorbed by Ryukyu.\n\nShuntiang, founded in 1821 (1, 1796) is the earliest Taoist temple in Singapore, located in the buds. Since 1920, China's southern provinces, a Taoist Taoist Taoist Taoist Taoist Taoist Taoist Taoists, and set up aunt and engaged in department. After decades of development, now Singapore's Zhengdui Taoist has Fujian to help (Minnan Help), Fuzhou Help, Xinghua, Guangdong Help, Hakka Help Hainan, which is the most in the number of people in Minnan. It has the greatest impact. Singapore's Zhengdui Taoist has also established a \"three clear church\" in 1979.\nIn March 1990, the Sanqing Road Church jointly formed the \"Singapore Taoism Tourism\" jointly formed with the other 27 Tuancong Temples. Invited Huang Xinyang, deputy president of the China Taoist Association, etc., the whole tribute, many times to travel to Singapore to open the Taoist training class, hosting the Fadie. At the same time, there is a wide range of contacts with the Zhengduo Taoist of China and the Taoist Group of Hong Kong and Taiwan. Singapore Taoist Association was established in 1996, the Taoist festival held on February 15th, the annual lunar calendar. Beginning in 1996, the Taoist actively participated in the blessings and prayers and other activities of the Singapore Religious Friendship Council consisting of nine religions of the Republic of Singapore. At the beginning of the 21st century, the three-Qing Dynasty, the main hall, the main hall for the ancestors, the true Wu Dynasty, Zheng a teacher, Zuo Hall to serve the whole truth Lu Dongbin, Wang Chongyang, Qiu Dongchang three ancestors, the right hall for the sacred people, Reflect the aim of \"three teaching one\". Singapore Road Teaching Institute, and Sanqing Taoism Library, in 2008 at the Sanyue Palace. The Teaching School has cultivated young and has a taught for Singapore. Operation, cultural conservation, can implement the Taoist staff of the Taoistological instrument.\n[46]\n[47]\n\nAuthentic Malaysian roads are still in development. In 2006, they joined the religious advisory Council to become a religion of the officially recognized, [48] [49] [50] The general Chinese people may not be able to distinguish the authentic education, the people's faith, Fortifications and feng shui are different. [51] In order to promote authentic Taoist beliefs, Malaysian Daojiao will order the \"Taoist Festival\" in the Lunar New Year's Eve (Too Old Jun), helping the believers to go to the Chinese Dragon and Tiger Mountain, and the trisum And hold a lecture, exchange meeting, Taoist cultural training class, return to the Zong Dynasties, a chanting class, National Day Prayer Conference, etc. [50] The main national Taoist organizations include the Malaysian Docao Class, the Malaysian Docao Association, Taoist Youth League, Malaysia Sanqing Road Church.\n\nAs early as the Tang Dynasty, Xuanzang Master will translate \"morality\" into Sanskrit spread to Tianzhu (India).\n\nIn the 16th century, \"Morality\" was translated into Western text by Europeans. After the 17th century, with the Western merchant shipped and trip, the \"Morality\" was gradually introduced into Europe, and Westerners took \"Morality\". \"Translated into Latin, French, German, English and other languages, and Laozi 's thought will gradually spread throughout the European continent. It is said that German philosopher Leibniz is originally based on Fuxi, Huang Lao's yin and Yang's yin and Yang, and gave a western name \"Dialectic\" for Taiji Yanyang, of course, this statement did not have effectively confirmed. Over the past few hundred years, the total number of Western translations in \"Tao Te\" has been nearly 500 species, involving 17 European texts, and the \"Bible\", \"The Bible\" is the first, \"Morality\" is located in the world cultural master of foreign languages. Second [52].\n\nTaoism has developed in many parts of Western. [53] [Need better source] As in December 1995, the British Daojiao Association was officially established in London. This is the earliest intersection of Europe. Since 1999, Taoist Tamada Chengyang Road, should be invited by the Madrid University of Spain and the Barcelona Taiji Center, approved by the National Religious Bureau and the Chinese Taoist Association, and went to Spain to lecture, professor local believers. In May 2001, joint local disciples founded the Taoist Association, the winter solstice in the same year, the first road to Europe was completed, and the Spanish government was officially confirmed, and the legal status of the Catholic equality in Spain. This is a milestone in Taoism into the European continent. Current Taoist believers in Europe are increasing. [54]\n\nIn the United States, there is a Mobil Road, New York, has a Tianhou Palace in New York, and San Francisco has a purple root, Hawaii has Taixuan Taoist view. In 2007, under the leadership of Mr. Zeng Yongxiang, a group of Mr. Zeng Yongxiang, president of the Sino-US Cultural Promotion Association, visited the Holy Land, and visited. The American Taoist Association plays $ 20 million in the US Rocky Mountains, the proportion of Wudang Mountain is built in the proportion of Wudang Mountain.\n\nTaoism and Buddhism acts as the main religion of China, both of them absorb each other in mutual competition, making them more applicable to the needs of China's local culture. After Buddhism introduced to China, check the ideology, rituals, sacrifices, etc. of the Ruogao Taoism, so that the small part of China's Religious Buddhism, today, the small department of China's Mahayana, can be said to be a Taoist version of Taoism. Moreover, many of Taoist's texts are referred to in the writing of Buddhist scriptures, and many rituals also refer to Buddhism such as morning and evening, feeding vegetarian. Although Chinese ancient people also have vegetarian people, but they have not strongly advised, but they have passed the country when they arrived. The study of Buddhism is the most obvious thing about the full truth and the whole three altar. If the Sazu flame mouth is written in the Miki Miyou Lama in the Ming and Qing Dynasties, it can also be said to teach the flames of Buddhism. Otherwise, the folks will not say flames, and the Buddha is not fighting.\n\nHan Di Yan Yan nine years (166), there is a statement of \"or the old man who has turned into the Si Di\" of the Di Di \". When I arrived in the West Jin Dynasty, the Buddhist Dao is very big. Tianshi Dao Sacrifice is a challenge to Buddhism. Later, Shamen was killed in time, and I raised Laozi Hu, Buddha, and Different Conversely debate. When the Tang Dynasty, the contradiction between Buddhism is most intense. And the Yuan Dynasty, all the truths and the old things will attack Buddhism, and the monk debate with the Western Region.\n\n\"Taiping Jing\" mentioned \"Laozi to the West 80 years\". \"Three Kingdoms \u00b7 Wei Shu\" mentioned \"Duo Tu\", with Chinese Laozi, cover the Laozi West, cross the Western Region, to Tiansheng Hu, and the floating disciple, twenty, nine. \"The most famous in history is I firmly believe that Laozi Huang and the representative of the promotion of the sects of the Tang Dynasty to watch the Tang Dynasty.\n\nThe most important point to Taoism is that the most important point of the god is in the \"Note 9]. I believe that everything is spiritual, even the various organs of the human body have the gods; and the road is the world's own source, but not recognized the only one of the world.\n\nThe ideal world of Taoism is different from the heroes of Abraham [Note 10] [55]. There are two ideal worlds in Taoism, one is a secular, one is religion.\n\nThe ideal world of Taoism is to hopes that the world has become a fair, peaceful world, no disaster, no war; Christianity believes that life will gene in the initial original sin, life will slowly try and experience good and bad, and think \"life Full of richness, through gods to transform life, thus affect life with life, let more people return to create the master \"; Taoism does not agree with the original sin, think that people's fate can grasp, life can change , Extended, \"Xi Ri\" cloud \"I am in me is not in the sky\", or \"life can't change, but can be changed\", and it is also a bitter thing that lives in the world, death is also painful. Therefore, it is improving to the world, and the transfers will be transferred to the world. It is the blessings of Yanshou. It is a feathering to the immortality. The pursuit of \"long-lived longitude\" [56], the longevity is not dead, and there are many health methods, such as Qigong. Waiting for the Taoism to be carried forward. [57] Religious ideal world is \"Wonderland\" [58], Taoism pursues to be a fairy, so you can get back to life and death, and live in the fairy. Unlike other religions, Taoism does not think that people can reach Wonderland after death, but believe that people's body can be long-lived in some forms, and they can live in ordinary people in the world of ordinary people. \"I can live in the fairyland. However, because the realm of achieving the immortal is very difficult, then \"corpse solution\" is then appeared [59]. Some scenic places are known as human faiigines because they are suitable for cultivation, such as so-called \"Dong Tianfu\" is some representative places.\n\nThe ideal world of Taoism does not have all the buddhism. Buddhism believes that life is suffering; Taoism is through practice to reach unsatisfactory, and the longevity is not afraid to death. The most important difference between Taoism and Buddhism and the Buddhism is to treat life and death attitude. Taoism conveys the believers, what should people go on the road to life; reaching it is not dead by practicing, and the longevity is not old. The goal of Buddhism is \"Nirvana\" to leave the life and death.\n\nThe same name has a combination of \"Tao\" and the teachings of procurement of Confucianism, Release, Dao, Ye, and return. The central idea has replaced the \"\u6c14 \u5929 \u6cd5\" of Taoism in \"Ruiming Law\", and it is no longer alchemy, fully trending Confucianism [60]. The main god of the concerted centrality is clear God, the missionary venue is called \"Buddhist Hall\", so it is very different from orthodox Taoism [61]. It is still legal religion in Taiwan, but it has been banned in mainland China.\n\n[Edit in Wiki Data] Humanities (English: humanities), and translators literature is to explore human emotions, morality and rational criticism (literature, philosophy, religion, art, historiography, anthropology, linguistics, etc. with observation, analysis and rational criticism. ) And the general name of knowledge.\n\nThe Chinese words of humanities, the earliest appearance in the \"Yi Jing\", the words: \"Just soft, astronomy. Civilization, humanities also. Waiting for astronomy to change the time; watching humanities into the world. \"There are a lot of annotations about this word. The explanation of\" Yichuan Yi Chuan \"in the Song Dynasty is:\" Astronomy, the heavens are also; humanities, people also. Astronomy, the sun and moon, the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun, Yin Yang The generation change, observed the operation, to check the speed change of the four time. Humanities, the nervies, the concept of humanities, the world, the world has become a customs, and the saints are also useful. \"(See\" Yichuan Yi Chuan \" Volume 2) Generally speaking, Chinese traditional human concept refers to various properties of people.\n\nIn modern times, the word \"humanism\" is used to translate \"humanism\", which is humanism. This word is some intellectuals in European literary revival. In the process of surpassing and opposing the traditional European religious tradition, the ancient Greece, Roman culture is learning. Model, return to the secular. These people are known as \"human Chinese scholars\". In 19th century Europe, there is a so-called humanistic discipline, and there are also humanities in the 20th Century Best University. The meaning of humanities is not to speak humanistic things with a scientific theory, but a kind of knowledge of people's knowledge is discussed for people's knowledge.\n\nUnder the influence of Chinese modern intellectuals, under the influence of traditional and Western countries, the understanding of the close-related vocabulary connotations of humanities, humanism and humanities have experienced a lot of changes.\n\nThe history of the Western Research Humanities can be traced to ancient Greece, and the humanities discipline is the foundation of citizen education. In the ancient Roman period, the concept of three schools is beginning to form. [1] These subjects became the Middle Ages' educational subject, emphasizing humanistic disciplines like technology or doing things.\n\nAnd China's research on humanities is very early, such as \"poetry\" compiled by Philosophers, a philosopher in Spring and Autumn, is the side reflection of civilians and basic morality of civilians, including love. Or the universal nature of Westerners' minds and the values \u200b\u200bof the humanities, and thus the research of humanities disciplines is proposed, mainly in the form of drama, legend, novels, etc., and \"Dou Yu\" as an example, will The value comment of the humanistic orientation system, and ignored the \"critical feudal system to cruel compression and underlying women\", just a ring of humanism, not enough to represent universal humanistic thoughts. Furthermore: \"The rulers in China's different feudal periods have conducted different levels of humanities, so that the development of humanities in China has been slow, and there is no system science, and even participants itself also receives a cruel persecution. Just To the \"May 4th\" period, humanities learned really started to go to mainstream culture. Although the initial Humanism has appeared in different forms of literature, the humanities discipline contains all kinds of facies, generally believes that \"Wen, History, Zhe\" is the basic field of humanities, is the understanding of the essence of humanities. . It is a kind of \"White Horse is a horse, white horse\", and the white horse is a horse, but this term is not enough to represent all horses. Furthermore, when attacking the feudal system, it cannot be simply \"symbolized\" feudal system, regardless of the essence, should first clarify the characteristics of the feudal system, so as to avoid the phenomenon of attacking the old feudal system. Xia, Shang, Zhou 's \"Sealing Building\" political system, that is, the stage of the old class form, the class becomes the value of the value of a person, and the people are different from the family of birth, and there is a discerning, this kind of bloodline is feudal Institutional granary.\n\nDuring the Renaissance During the Renaissance, the humanities were identified as a discipline that only studied and un practical, and suddenly detached from traditional areas such as literature and history. In the twentieth century, this view was challenged by the modern movement, which was to seek an equal definition in the democratic society. [2]\n\nClassical, sometimes known as ancient research or classical civilization research, is an important branch of humanities.\n\nThe word anthropology (English: Anthropology) originated from Greek \"\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 (Anthr\u014dpos, people)\" and \"\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 (-logia, discipline)\", meaning the research person's discipline. This discipline name has appeared in German philosopher Hend (English: Magnus Hundt) in 1501 \"anthropology - about people's advantages, essence and characteristics, and human ingredients, parts and elements\" (ANTROPOLOGIUM De Hominis Dignitate Natura et Proprietatibus, de Elementis, Partibus et membracris humani corporis, at that time, the word of humanology referred to a human body structure. [3] [4] The contemporary anthropology has the source of natural science, humanities and social science. [5]\n\nReligion is a cultural system of contacts and supernatural gods or transandalism. It can be divided into multiple styles, pan the god, and the aid and unsyardial [6], including personal behavior, traditional ritual, value concept, world concept, Classic works, pilgrimage, moral norms, or social groups [7]. Religion is a consensus and reverence of a certain system. The humanologist Clevrew Germ is claimed to complement with myths and philosophy, and religion is equivalent to a \"survival of survival\" in a human social sector. [8]\n\nDifferent religions may contain different elements, including but not limited to sexy, sacraging, beliefs, supernatural existence (one or more), the ultimate or superior life experience of believers or strength. The form of religion includes ceremonies, preaching, commemorative or worshiping god, sacrifice, holiday, festival, funeral service, marriage service, prayer, music, art, dance, public service or other cultural form. Religion may record the origin of life, universe or other things through the sacred history, the symbolic meaning and holy land, and to express the meaning of life. In the traditional sense, faith is considered a source of religious beliefs. About 10,000 different religions around the world are affiliated with 5 largest religions, Christian, Islam, Hindu, Buddhism or different forms of folk religion [10].\n\nPhilosophy can be divided into many different branches, mainly including forms, enhancement, ethics, logic and aesthetics.\n\nIn order to study, it refers to the study of the existence and the essence of things. Ideal school is a scope in philosophical research, which is considered \"First Philosophy\" and \"The Basic Problem of Philosophy\". It refers to a problem that the rational reasoning and logic can not be directly perceived, which is a discipline of human rationality for the most common cause of the most common face and the ultimate cause of things.\n\nThe main problems of my own upper school include: What existence is there? (What is ultimately there?) What is it? (What is it like?)\n\nMasterpiece tried to clarify that people are used to understand the basic concepts of the world (categories), such as existence, objects, and their nature, space and time, causality, and possibilities. One of the main branch disciplines of the MPRO is this vocabulary, that is, the basic category and its interrelated research. The main branch of another form of school is the cosmology, that is, the source of the source (if any), basic structure, nature, and universe dynamics.\n\nCosmology (English: COSMOLOGY) or the universe, this word originates from Greek \u03ba\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3 (Cosmologia, ORDER + \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 (Logia) discourse). Cosmology is a study of the overall of the universe and extends to the status of humans in the universe. Although the word cosmology is only recently, people have a long history of research on the universe, involving science, philosophy, mysterious learning, and religion.\n\nThere is currently different views on the relationship between \"knowledge\" and \"epistemology\". Some scholars believe that although the knowledge and understanding of understanding is closely related, there are some important differences. They believe that knowledge is about the content of thinking activities, and understanding is the possibility of knowledge. However, there are also scholars to put forward different statements, and believe that territory and understanding are the same, including a holistic concept including the above.\n\nLogic (English: logic), also known as the philosophical study of effective inference, theories, theories, and inference. [11] Logic is used in most intelligent activities, but mainly in the philosophy, psychology, learning, inference statistics, brain science, mathematics, semantics, law and computer science, etc. are considered a discipline. The logical discussion of the general form of logical demonstrations, which form is effective, as well as the paradox.\n\nLogic can usually be divided into three parts: summarizing reasoning, with reasoning and interpretation of reasoning.\n\nIn philosophy, logic is applied in most main areas: - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nIn mathematics, logic refers to formal logic and progenyl logic, and form logic is a valid inference of a formal language [12]. It is mainly to interpret the results. Logic will also be learned in dialectics [13]. Mathematical logic is to study abstract logical relationships and mathematical problems.\n\nIn psychology, brain science, semantics, law, is the treatment of human thought reasoning.\n\nIn the study, inference statistics, it is the best possible conclusion. Mainly induced by reasoning, traceability.\n\nIn computer science, it is to study the nature, possibilities, and implementation of various methods. It is mainly summarizing reasoning, and it is also in the study of reasoning.\n\nStarting from ancient civilization (such as India [14], China [15] and Greece) have a logic. In the West, Aristotle establishes logic into a formal discipline and gives it a basic location in philosophy.\n\nTraditional linguistics are called language to study ancient literature and written languages. In China, there has been a part of the e-learning, training, and literature. Modern language is dominated by contemporary language and speaking. Generalized linguistics include language.\n\nThese disciplines have also affected the study of linguistics. For example, symbolics is a related area that involves research on both general tags and symbols in language and language. The Studies of Literary Theory Studies in Language in Literary Art. In addition, linguistics are also known from different fields, like psychology, speech-language pathology, information learning, computer science, biology, human anatomy, neurology, sociology, humanology, and acoustic.\n\nHistorical Linguistics, also known as the Diachronic Linguistics, is a discipline of studying language changes. Historical linguistics is an important branch of linguistics.\n\n\n\nVoice is the language branch of speech (ie, speech). Narrow phonology corresponds to the word Phonetics (pronunciation) in English, focusing on specific voice nature and method of generating speech, relative to sound rhyme (or said), study the sound or speech difference character Abstract rules and voice systems operated in a language. Generalized phoneticity refers to the total research of these two major aspects. This article describes a narrow voice. Voice is the object of phonetics, refers to the specific sound of human speaking, that is, the sound of words. The international audio symbols set by the International Learning Society are widely used in the language community to mark the phonetic scheme of the voice.\n\nAvailability (English: Phonology or Phonemics), also known as the Department of Juvenile (China), Yun Yun (Japan), Vocalicology, Templer (Taiwan) [16] [17], for the language branch discipline, is a study A Learning of a Language Touch.\n\nStylistic, also known as morphology, is a branch of linguistics, studying the internal structure of the word and its formation. If English's Dog, Dogs, and Dog-Catcher have considerable relationships, English users can use their background knowledge to judge this relationship, for them, Dog and Dogs relationships are like CAT and CATS, DOG and DOG-CATCHER. Just as Dish and Dishwasher. Structured is a relationship to studying this single interval, and tries to organize the rules of its composition.\n\nResearch on the discipline of a language evolution from the development of syntax structure in history.\n\nHistoric law is also from historical linguistics and is a cross discipline.\n\nStudy the relationship between the relationship between the relative language syntax structure, mutual influence, and the discipline of the relative relationship between each language.\n\nComparing laws and laws are also from comparative linguistics.\n\nTo study a language, in a particular period, its detailed syntax structure discipline.\n\nIt is a cross-discipline that describes speaking language.\n\nDialect: dialect geography\n\nSecond language teaching: English teaching\n\nLiterature (English: LITERATURE), in the broadest sense, is any single written work. More stringent, literary writing is considered to be an artistic form, or any single work that is considered to have art or intellectual value, usually due to deploying languages \u200b\u200bin a different way different from ordinary use. Its latin root Literatura / Litteratura (itself originated from Littera: Letter or Handwriting) is used to refer to all written records, although contemporary definitions extend the terminology to text (oral literature) including oral or singing. Literature can be classified according to the fictional work or non-fictitious works, or it can be classified according to the rhyme or the prose; can be further distinguished according to the main forms of long novels, the novels, short novels; works often according to historical periods or to certain aesthetics Features or expectations (art types) are classified. Reflections with language text to reflect the art, including rhyme, prose, scripts, novels, etc., is an important manifestation of culture, with different genres in the inner emotions and reproduction of life and a certain period of life.\n\nThis concept changed its significance over time: Now it can expand the verbal art form of non-book, can cooperate with the language or text itself, so it is difficult to agree on its origin. The development of printing technologies makes the distribution and spread of written works, and ultimately leads to online literature.\n\nLiterature is not necessarily objective, a successful writer can show his own subjective views, express their emotions and feelings, but by trying to build a \"objective standard\", When you can help writers to learn about \"readers' feelings\" to seek emotions and art The performance is completely reflected in the reader. Sometimes it can also borrow the idea of \u200b\u200bthinking about the society, such as the rise of women's literature.\n\nOral literature is a literary work that is passing in the mouth. It is the main flow of folk literature. Its content can include poetry, story, etc. In folk oral literature, oiling poems, yellow stories and ghost stories are three types. For example, China's four folk legends are slowly formed by oral literature.\n\nArt refers to the integration and balance of integrated techniques, will, imagination, experience, etc., to create implicit aesthetic utensils, environment, images, action or sound expression patterns, to point to others, or have deep meaning Emotional and conscious humans are used to express existing perceived and personal or group experiences in the process [18].\n\nSince the 20th century, it has been constantly emerged in conventional forms of elements other than traditional definition art, such as common \"Technical Art),\" Digital Art \",\" Installation Art \"(Installation ART) , \"Conceptual ART\", \"Behavioral Art\", \"Biological Art\", etc. Such a variety of art forms continue to challenge the limit of the artistic theory. Regarding how art is recognized, it has become an open problem, and it is currently based on the current recognition of art world.\n\nThere are many different functions in history, so it is difficult to abstract the purpose of art into a single concept. This does not mean that the purpose of art is to vague, but there are many different art creations, unique reasons. The purpose of an art will be listed below, which is divided into two types (Motivated).\n\nHistory, referred to as historiography, is a discipline with history as a research object. Although in a broad history can include things other than humans, but as a literature, history is mainly based on human society as research objects.\n\nArchaeological (English: Archaeology or Archeology, from the ancient Greek: \u1f00\u1f00\u03c7\u03b1\u03b9;; \u1f00\u1f00\u03c7 \u1fd6\u1fd6\u1fd6\u03c2, arkha\u012bos, \"ancient\"; and -\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3, -logi\u0101, \"learning\"), for the past human society, mainly through reconstruction Analyze the material culture and environmental materials of the ancient people, including equipment, buildings, and biology (English: Biofact (Archaeology) and cultural landscape (English: Cultural Landscapes). Due to many different research procedures, it can be identified as a science and one-person literature, [29] and in the United States, it is a branch of anthropology, [30] is an independent discipline in Europe.\n\nArchaeological study human history, from the world's earliest stone buffer's development from the past, until modern times. [31] This discipline is the most important historic research discipline. There is no text data available in the prehistoric age for historians, and this era accounts for more than 99% of human overall history, from the old stone age until the writing text appears. [29] Archeology has a variety of different goals, scope from the study of human evolution to cultural evolution and understanding of cultural history. [32]\n\nArcheology includes a site survey (English: Archaeology Field Survey), discovers (English: Excavation (Archaeology)) and final analysis of the collection of information in order to know more human. As far as the macro vision, archaeological remarging interdisciplinary analysis, disciplined assistance from anthropology, historical, art history, classic, nationalology, geography, [33] geology, [34] [35] [ Linguistics, Physics, Information Science, Chemistry, Statistics, Guqi, Ancient Zoology, Ancient Biology, Ancient Ethnic Botany (English: Paleoethnobotany) and Ancient Fluenics.\n\nArchaeological was developed by European Collection (English: Antiquarianism) in the 19th century. From then on, it becomes a discipline throughout the world. From the beginning, the archeology of various specialty has developed, including the ocean archaeological (English: Maritime Archaeology) and archaeological astrictions, and diverse science and technology to assist archaeological investigations. However, the archaeologist today faces many questions, including facing fake archaeological (English: Pseudoarchaeolog), stiishing plunder, and discovered against human beings.\n\nIf China's history, there is approximately 3,300 years from China's first system Oracle or Tao Wen's text (the first 1300 years); from the first dynasty of the archaeological, there are about 3,700 Year; from the legendary Xia Dynasty in the Xi Zhou literature, about 4,100 years (the first 2070 counted); from Confucius, there is about 4,700 years (counting the top 2698); From the uncertain myths such as Pangu, God, Women, there is about 5,000 years (this is also the length of traditional folk cognition); there is approximately 10,000 magnetic mountain culture marking the nemesis era of civilized sprout. Year; from human beings start from the original life of the old stone, Santian culture, a history of more than 800,000 years. [37]\n\nThe history of population refers to the history of population development and its situation.\n\nAbout China's population growth history.\n\nStudies and record the origins of a family and their relatives. Social science is a scientific method to study various phenomena of human society. Narrow \"Social Science\" is an empirical scientist study, interpretation and prediction of human social organization, structure and activities, such as sociology research contemporary human society, political research politics, policies and related activities, economics research resources distribution. Generalized \"Social Science\", as a corresponding object of natural science (in nature research object), is a collective discipline and humanistic disciplines of all human research objects. The concept of \"Social Science\" originated in the \"Encyclopaedia of the Social Science\" published in 1930, which includes psychology, linguistics, criminal, education, legal, political, economics. And a discipline related to business, sociology and social work, geography, management, etc. related to social sciences.\n\nSocial science is a discipline after the enlightenment of the Eighth Century. Over time, it has also established which scope of research objects, and the concept of social science has broad and narrow. In 1968, Taiwan published \"Cloud Five Social Sciences\" has identified the following 12 social science research objects, including: psychology, education, statistics, legal, political, administrative, International relations, economics, sociology, anthropology, historical, geography.\n\nSocial science includes:\n\nPolitical, economics, and sociology are typical narrow social sciences. Some disciplines, such as historics, is a narrow sense of social science and human discipline, but it is usually understood as the humanities. The broad \"Social Science\" includes humanities disciplines, such as the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences with two types of social sciences and humanities. Legal or legal research is less research methods, and therefore do not belong to the social science disciplines in the narrow sense, and law research is not in traditional humanities, but the law study is sometimes Subject to a broad social science discipline.\n\nSome disciplines, such as psychology, anthropology, archeology, geography, intersection of social sciences and natural sciences, which is different from research direction, policy orientation. For example, psychology, China's mainland education institutions will psychology in accordance with Natural Science and Technology College, such as participating in the establishment of the Psychology Department of Nanjing University, in 1956 (including the Republic of China) in 1956 (including the Republic of China) Next; and Hong Kong educational institutions are attributed to social sciences.\n\nNorth American education institutions advocate \"unsolicientation\" (immediate social sciences and natural sciences as the same big category), with more social science disciplines into the \"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences\", will social science, nature Scientific and other subjects are called \"Sciences\".\n\nIn mainland China, in Maxie thinking, marxist philosophy as the guiding ideology of Chinese social sciences, one degree of humanities discipline and social science in philosophy, and collect humanities and social sciences as \"philosophy and social sciences\". With the diversified transformation of society, academic freedom explores spaces will become increasingly large, and the definition and classification of social science will begin to change. Philosophy (English: philosophy) is a discipline, basic issues, including existence, knowledge, value, sensibility, mind, language and other fields [1] [2]. The difference between philosophy and other disciplines is that philosophy has a unique thinking method, such as criticism, usually a systematic approach, and is based on rational argument [3]. In daily terms, philosophy can be attached to the most basic beliefs, concepts or attitudes of individual or groups [4], but this is not here.\n\nEnglish Word Philosophy (Latin: Philosophia) Since the ancient Greek \u03b9\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1, meaning \"Love Wisdom\", sometimes translated as \"Wisdom of Friends\" [5] [6], this word is \u03c6\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 (Philos, Love) The derived word \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6\u1fd6 (Philein, I Love) and \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 (Sophia, Wisdom) are combined. It is generally believed that the ancient Greek thinker Pythagora 200 introduces two terms \"philosophers\" and \"philosophy\" in the work [7].\n\nThe word \"philosophy\" refers to the ancient Chinese refers to those who are good at thinking, learn to be young, such as \"Confucius Ten Zhe\", \"Guosheng Pen\", etc. thinker\". In 1874, Japan's enlightenment family, first translation of philosophy in \"Hundreds of Philosophy\" in \"One New On\" [8] [9]. The Chinese name of the philosophy and the Chinese name of the English: Metaphysics is taken from \"Yi Jing \u00b7 Zhou Zhu\", \"shape is said to be said,\" the person is said to be said \"[10].\n\nBritish philosopher Russell's definition of philosophy is:\n\nHu Shi said in the \"Chinese Philosophical Sylla\". \"Any question of studying life, fundamentally thinks, to find an fundamental solution: this kind of learning is philosophical\" [12].\n\nAlthough philosophy is from the traditional Western tradition, many civilizations have some similar topics in history [13]. East Asia and South Asia philosophy are called Oriental philosophy, while North Africa and the Middle East are often considered part of Western philosophy because they are closely interacted with Europe.\n\nThere are many views on philosophy. Some people think that philosophy is a review of the process of the problem itself; others believe that there is a philosophical proposition that must be answered in philosophy. [14]\n\nAncient Greek philosophers often ask questions. The issues they have proposed can probably be classified as three categories. These three types of issues have formed philosophical basic disciplines, respectively, to go to school, ethics, knowledge [15] [C 1] [a 1] [16].\n\nThe philosophical theory of \"not required to accurate reason\" in modern philosophy, such as \"essential skills\" (identified inherently unknown), this phenomenon will not be known (the existence of someone else can not understand).\n\nSince the Aristotle Era, logic usually plays an important role in classical or modern philosophy. In particular, the three paragraphs proposed have a far-reaching impact on Western philosophy. [17]\n\nPhilosophy can be divided into many different branches, mainly including forms, enhancement, ethics, logic and aesthetics [18] [19].\n\nThese branches are philosophical research applications in other disciplines, or cross disciplines.\n\nMany human communities think about philosophical problems and learn to establish a variety of philosophical genres.\n\nOriental philosophy is organized through historical periods in each region. Western philosophy can generally be divided into three or more, the most important thing is classical philosophy, medieval philosophy and modern philosophy [20].\n\nThe historical source of Indian philosophy is long. As early as the period of the Veda, it has begun to the 6th century BC. At that time, the ancient Indian thought circles were released. The most famous of the famous Buddhist founder Sakyamuni Buddha, Jain founder, Zhamo, Aprendo, Wings, Po, Pu Fu, Franka, Frana \u00b7 Gay, the number of theories, etc.\n\nThe main part of Chinese philosophy originated in the East Week, when the ambiguism is widely known [21], with Confucian Confucianism, Laozi's Taoist, Mozi's ink home and late Fa, and some geography, such as farms, yin and yang The name is not shown in and the name of the name. In addition to the French, Confucianism, other genres outside the Qin Dynasty were no longer active. In contemporary, Chinese philosophy is still playing in Asian culture, but the physiology is still arguing whether Chinese philosophy should be sure to philosophy.\n\nFor example, Mou Zong San has defined philosophy: \"Anything to the humanity activities and reflection, it is philosophy.\" Milong 3 believes that China has thousands of years of cultural history, there is a philosophy. It is just Chinese philosophy to attach importance to the subjectivity, and the West attaches importance to the objectivity. Therefore, if the philosophy is defined in philosophy, China does not have this. However, if the primary direction is defined under philosophy, Chinese culture has philosophy. The vice versa of the Western philosophy is mostly in literature, art, music, etc. Just in the history of Western philosophy, there is no chapter to talk about Jesus. [twenty two]\n\nAncient Greek-Roman philosophy is a period of Western philosophy, time for the 6th century BC [about 585] to the 6th century. It is generally divided into three periods: former Socrates period, Plato and Aristotle Classical Greek period, and then Aristotle (or Greek) period: sometimes will put new Bora chart and Christianity The advanced era of philosophers is added as the fourth period.\n\nIn the 6th century BC, Western philosophy has begun to stand out from ancient mythology and poetry, and gradually began to develop independently on the composition of the universe and the thinking of the source. Former natural philosophers in the former Socrate period pay more attention to nature, it is considered to be the earliest philosopher in the West [23], whether they understand and explain whether the world is correct, but their ideas are reasons for superstition In yosing, these philosophers have summarized the phenomenon of nature in a rational counseling. Such as:\n\nThe priority of the research in the mid-5th century BC has formed the focus of the study to the human itself. It is believed that \"the talent is the foundation of all things\". They don't believe in real existence and truth. Protegola believes that it is non-good and evil that is relative to people, and Golgia believes that all the same fake, this is the narrowed shape. [A 2] [B 1] [D 1] [C 2]\n\nAt the end of the 6th century BC, the philosophy of Pythaglas-based Pythaglas School, the philosophy, and the aforementioned views of the foregoing. The history of Rome records the first name of Pythagora, saying that he is a philosopher, or is love wisdom [24]. He believes that \"everything is a number.\" It means that the essence and structure of all things are determined by the digital relationships they contain. He claims that the average, order and harmony is the three major tones of the universe, and the hint of the universe is tiered by music. His school will summarize the universe as a combination of ten nature: limited and unlimited, odd and even, less and more, left and right, male and female, static and moving, straight with song, bright and darkness, goodness Evil, party and circle. At this time, the essence of mathematics and its status has always been one of the main problems of philosophy. Mathematics is not affected by the uncertainty of observation and experimentation, and it is understood by pure thinking. [A 2] [B 2] [D 2] [C 3] [24]\n\nAmong them, the relationship between change and constant, the difference between the real world and the intuition world, the contradiction between truth and opinion, leads to a problem of collapse.\n\nThe key characteristics of Western philosophical methods in the classical Greek period are established: relying on resort to rationality and argumentation, through a critical approach to accept or establish a view. This includes the dialectics of Socrates known as the Socate anti-law or \"refutorial\" approach, and he mainly uses its key moral concepts such as kind and fairness and justice. This approach decomposes a question into a series of questions, gradually extracts the answer you want to find in question, which can be seen from the scientific methods used in the current use of the scientific method. stage.\n\nSocrates did not teach people directly, but the Berracha is deeply affected. The entire philosophical idea comes from two theories: one, never do bad things; second, one inner is really kind and just people will never do the opposite. He believes that the truth has its objectiveness, trying to overthrow the wise people 's ideas for the truth with individual subjective feelings. Then put forward the concept of Germany, as as a direction of life. What is the problem of morality, Socrate's reply is \"knowledge is moral.\" What is the problem of knowledge, he replied that knowledge is the concept of rationality. Socrates pioneered epistemology and ethics, so that he laid his philosophical status [a 3] [B 3] [D 3] [C 4].\n\nThe philosophers in the classical Greek period Zhongba Lave and Aristotle have the greatest influence on the later generations [25], especially Plato is considered to be the founder of Western philosophy. Philosopher Alfred Nos White Black Evaluation Plato: \"European philosophy tradition is most commonly recognized, that is, it contains a series of pins to Plato. I mean is not a suspected scholar system system. Extract the work from the Archa. I hinted the wealth of the general thoughts they scattered. \"[26] Even for thousands of years, people still tried to answer the questions he raised, which also represents these problems. Or more problems extending in these issues are confused.\n\nPythagoras' thoughts have a significant impact on Plato and affect the entire Western philosophy through Plato. Plato and Aristotle have critored other \"wise people\" as the earliest classical Greek philosophers, and these people were called \"defense\" in Greece and quite common before Pythagora. From their criticism, in their classical era, a purely \"love wisdom\" (real philosophers) and those earlier travel teachers - often through their own skills - - was established after the watershed.\n\nAfter Aristotle died, the entire philosophical circle was in the independent period, called the Greek philosophical period. Because the entire society and politics are fascinated. During this period, Stumen Geraiso and Yilu Lu Ruchi were produced, as well as skepticism, New Bra Titi and New Pichatoporism. The common feature of these schools is ethical. Stumen is mainly to comply with nature and homemade. The Eli Lu Luxue is the standard of happiness as the nature and goodness of life. The Newbora Titi and New Pythagoras are philosophies with religiousism and gradually produce melted theory of Christianity and Greek philosophy, which is the later Christian philosophy.\n\nUntil 529 BD, Rome Chairman Chaser Dingniyi Command Close Athens Plato College [A 4] [B 4] [D 4] [C 5]. J.B. Bury said some of the remaining college members escaped into the Sasan Dynasty, Thai Sea [27].\n\nIndian philosophy refers to the philosophical ideology originated in the Indian sub-continent, including Hindu Teaching Philosophy (English: Hindu Philosophy), Buddhist philosophy, Jain Philosophy (English: Jainism Philosophy), these Indian philosophy have some common and complex origins. There are themes related to Dharma and industry, and all hope to reach individual liberation. These philosophy of philosophy is in the previous century to the West New Year's time.\n\nThe medieval philosophy refers to the philosophical system of Western Europe and the Middle East in the Middle Ages, and its time range has not contained, which is roughly from Christian Roman Empire to the Renaissance [28]. The medieval philosophy is partially defined as a re-discovery and further development of classical Greece and Greece philosophy, and the other is to solve theological problems and interact with the world of Bellahan Education (Islam, Jewish and Christian).\n\nRenaissance people exclude a \"transition\" barbarous period between the classical era of Rome, Greece and classical culture. However, in the Middle Ages, this is still growing in Europe in Europe. Netherlands Glacia (English: Jorge Gracia) believes that \"in strength, complexity also has achievements, it is convinced that philosophy in the thirteenth century can be comparable to the golden period of the ancient Greek philosophy of BC.\" [ 29]\n\nThe problems discussed in this era have the relationship between beliefs and reason, the existence of God, the unity, theological topics and shapes, and the problem of knowledge, universe and individuals.\n\nMedieval philosophers include Christian scholar Hippo's Augustine, Bo Yuxus, Aselon, Pavijie's Gilport (English: Gilbert of Poitiers), Pierre Abra, Roill Bacon, Saint Wende, Thomas Aqua, Dun Si Divired, Okam's William and Bridam, etc .; Jewish philosophers Monnid and Gilans Nid (English: Gersonides); Muslim philosophers KFI, Faraby, Heshwood, Iben West, Ansauri, Iben Bazhe, Iben Tufili (English: IBN Tufail), Iben Helestown and Ira Ben Lu Shid et al. The medieval philosophy tradition is still active until the 17th century, such as Francisco Suarez and John Budo Tot (English: John Of St. Thomas). Among them, the parent of Thomas is greatly affected the entire Catholic Europe. He is particularly emphasized in rational and argumentation, one of the new translations of the works of Aristotle and enrichment. His work is obviously away from the idea of \u200b\u200bthe new Bora chart and Augustine, most of the early early quarterly philosophy.\n\nStarting from the Renaissance, people's thoughts begin to go out from the clean paradise and come to the world. Thus developing nature, it also develops humans themselves. Thus, two people who have both humanism and natural philosophy have both links and differences.\n\n\"Renaissance\" is a general term for the transition between the Middle Ages to modern times. [30] The re-learning of the classical literature is transferred from the interesteness of the philosophy, metaphysics and theology of the school. Educate and mysterious research. [31] [32] Research on classic and humanistic art, such as historical and literary, enjoy unprecedented interest in the Christian world academic community, this trend is called humanism [33] [34], it is suspected of Plato, Greece suspected The influence of mismatics and Roman Dora. Humanist's philosophy interest is transferred to the Creator and its virtue, replacing the intention of the medieval and logic [35] [36].\n\nAt that time, there were two new ways to study classical philosophy. On the one hand, the study of Aristotle has changed due to the influence of Aloloism (English: Averroism). The Avilo Yarosian and the more all-handed Catholic Aristotle, such as the difference between Elbot McNus and Thomas Aquari, eventually developed in the revival of literature and art. A \"Humanistic Aristotle Philosophy\", such as Boto, Pomponazzi (English: Pietro Pomponazzi) and Jakomo Sabarrira (English: Giacomo Z Thought of Abarella. On the other hand, with the help of the discovery of the works known to Western Europe, the study of Plato and New Brabi as another choice will become general. The famous Renaissance of the famous Renaissance, including Nikola, Kuca, and after Malcissilio Fechino and John Pedic Dram Milan Dora [36].\n\nRenaissance has also resended the interest of anti-Aristotle as an organic, living whole, not dependent on the theory of theology, such as Nikola, Nikola, Nikola, Nikola. Ni, Jaerno Bruno, Bernardino Telesio (English: Bernardino Telesio) also has the work of Tomaso Cantaina [37]. Such sports in natural philosophy and interested in mysterious, magic, and Hermensian also have interest, which are considered to hide the gates of harvesting knowledge and controlling natural methods. [38]\n\nThese new philosophical movements accompanied by the consensus of European religious and political dramatic: religious reform and feudal decline. Although theologists involved in religious reforms have no direct interest in philosophy, they break the traditional basis of theology and knowledge authority. Also accompanied by the rejuvenation of beliefism and skepticism, reflecting the thinkers such as Irasum, Montene and Sanchez (English: Francisco Sanches) [39] [40] [41]. At the same time, the process of politically gradually centralized centralized centralized centralized centralized political philosophy, such as Nico Makiaville (often described as the first modern political thinker, or the key to modern political thinking Point [42]), Thomas Moore, Irasum, Yustz Leps, letting Bodan and Hu Gui Ge, etc. [43] [44] [A 5 ] [B 5] [D 5].\n\nAfter the first Qin Zhu Si's two-haired, Wei Jin Xi Xue is a part of Chinese philosophy. Since the Tang Dynasty Buddhism has also begun to have an important impact on philosophy; however, the most important part of the Chinese philosophy is the development of Song Ming.\n\nSong Mingzuo has been against the Han Dynasty began to affect Confucianism and the superstition and mysterious elements in Buddhism. It is a philosophical movement advocacy and secularize Confucianism [45]. Although the students were criticized by Taoism and Buddhists, [46] Science still borrowed two of the terms and concepts. However, with Buddhism and Taoism, I met my shape as the spiritual development, the catalyst of religion and the immortal, and the Song Mingzhi has formed a guidance of establishing a rational ethical system [47]. The origin of Song Mingzukes can be traced back to Tang Dynasty: Han Yu and Li Wei are regarded as the pioneer of Song Agency [46]. Song Dynasty, Zhou Dunyi, the teaching of the school, established his ethical philosophical system as a framework, and he was seen as the founder of Song Mingzhi [47].\n\nOther places in East Asia, Japanese philosophy is formed in the local gods and Buddhism, Confucianism, Confucianism, and other Chinese philosophy and Indian philosophical school mixing. Similar to Japan, the emotional content of witch in North Korea (English: Korean Philosophy) was mixed into the acousticization of China.\n\nMain entry: modern philosophy\n\nThe modern early general refers to the 19th century and 18th centuries in the history of Western philosophy, including the enlightenment era [48]. Modern philosophy is different from its predecessor, and its relationship with traditional authorities such as churches, colleges, and Aristotle is more independent [49] [50], there have been new interests in the construction of knowledge and shapes and the above-in-law [51] [52] And get rid of the emergence of modern physics of natural philosophy [53]. Since the 17th century, modern philosophy will learn the focus of study. Due to the controversy of experience (empirical) and the theory (rationalism), the relationship between material and spirit is highlighted as the primary problem of collaborativeism.\n\nAt that time, other philosophical focus included spiritual nature and their relationship with the body. The new natural science impact on the topic of liberty will and God belongs to the theology of theology, and the secular basis of ethics and political philosophy.\n[54]. This trend was first distinctly reflected in the new, empirical procedures for the expansion of knowledge in Francis Bacon, and quickly academic and rationalism in Cartesian mechanism physics and rationalism. The form of huge influence is established [55]. Bacon uses the induction method, the first principal \"person\" proposed to \"people\" should actively interfere with the service [A 5] [B 5] [D 6].\n\nNasmus Hobus, ancestor of modern political philosophy, to apply this methodological system in political philosophy, including the modern theory of \"social contract\" [56] [57]. Early modern philosophy academic classics generally include Descartes, Sinoa, Leibnitz, Locke, Beckle, Hume and Kant [58] [59] [60]. At the same time, other ideas have also contributed to philosophy, such as Galileo, Pierre Galazi, Blazis Pasca, Mararord, Aisak Newton, Christian Wolf, Meng Derset, Pierre Bell, Thomas Rude, Let Le Lang Daren Bell and Adam Smith, let - Jacques Roussea is the groundbreaking character of anti-opening movement. The rough end of early modern philosophy is usually determined to be an attempt to define a definition of Imanur Kant, which proves scientific knowledge and use morality and freedom to adjust the system [61] [62] [63].\n\nThe rationalist Zhongli Cartesia believes that the material world is a single system consisting of mathematical relationships, and he attempts to translate physics into mathematics. In his work, he satirized the Chinese philosophy and the philosophical system in his era. It believes that \"I think so I am\" is an unsubstable starting point. Descartes is a binary attraction of the spirit and substance. In order to clarify the relationship, he firmly believes that in God, the spirit and substance are unified. Its theory is called Cartesian\n[a 6] [B 6] [D 7]. Sinoa is after Cartesale, another famous aurator. His epistemology, geometry and mechanical view come from Cartesi. But he does not agree with the binaryism of Cartes, believes that spirit and substances are only the only entity.\n[a 7] [B 5] [D 8]. Libniz as the only theory firmly maintains Cartesar's theory and refutes John Rock's theory. Unlike Cartes, he thinks the entity of all things is \"single child\", and there is no relationship with each other, but because \"pre-hypodal\" can coexist, that is, in God. \"Anti-harmony\" is adjusted to the duality of Dublin's dual balances and Sinoa entities. [b 5] [A 8] [D 9]\n\nLocke has developed experience. He does not agree with Cartesol's \"Talent Concept\", which presents whiteboard that he emphasizes people from feeling abstract universal concepts, thinking that individual things in the feeling are the first. However, he basically agreed with Cartesar's binaryism. Becklai has developed Locke's philosophical theory and put forward \"existence is perceived.\" He believes that there is no more than a perceptual theme and perceived perception. He very disagree with the abstract concept of the material, thinking that it is not objective, and it can't exist in people's hearts. David Hume's theory is further more than Becklai, but he is not only the substance entity does not exist, but it is more considered that the spiritual entity does not exist. Only recognize the existence of perception. He also believes that there is no uniformity and universality of its own unknown, and the universality is the highest principle. [a 9] [B 7] [D 10]\n\nThe debate of experience and the only theory also contains materialism and idealism. In the 18th century, France's Latini-Television public announced that materialism is the only thing, and the editorial of the encyclopedia Deddo also refused to recognize the existence of God.\n\nIn addition, Voltaire, Monndes and other encyclopedic scholars have involved in political and ethical areas. They all believe that mechanism is the final form - the substance is the only one and the eternal movement, the spirit is just the properties of the human brain. So they think that inorganic matter and organic matter cannot be subject to people, people's thinking is the result of human sense. However, they are still empiric, in causality, they think that only inevitably is the only thing, this is the idea of \u200b\u200bidealism [D 11] [A 5] [B 5].\n\nSince the middle of the 18th century, until the early 19th century, philosophy entered the summary of modern philosophy, this is the German classical philosophical period. There are two clues to mark the arrival of turning: 1. The relationship between thinking and existence is more clear; Second, the system dialectics are generated. Its represents the characters have I. Kant, J.G. F. W.W. Xie Lin, g.w.f. Hegel et al. [A 5] [B 5] [D 12]\n\nKant has brought three iconic creations to philosophy:\n\nHe is affected by Hume and has brought a revolution for Western philosophy. He believes that the study of philosophy is the rules of rational tasks.\n\nKant agreed to Hume's theory and believed that there were some principles that allowed the soul to organize experience and understanding, and evidence can be found in mathematics. That is, it is much more than the definition of the concept that is included in the proposition. He is called the priori method of critical philosophy, and some of the scientific and forms of experience will inevitably be pre-existing in everything.\n\nWith his three \"critical\" work, the corresponding structure is made for the priori method:\n\nHe also laid a new foundation for moral philosophy, and he gave the new meaning of freedom concept. Because of its influence, it is still in modern times, and its theory is called Kantism. [A 10] [B 8] [D 13] [b 9]\n\nFishert was originally acknowledged the cause of the mechanical decision of Sbinosha, but later was influenced by Kant, began to believe that the cause of the causal decision is only the surface, and it is the main body of independence of the inevitable slave. In this end, he has established subjective thinking and objective existence.\n\nXie Lin is from Fishert theory, but the influence of Subinosa and literary romanticism has created their own way. That is, he thinks that nature and spirit, existence and thinking, object and subject, the opposite surface, the unity of the same \"absolute\", this \"absolute\" is the root cause of all things. He believes that art is the most intuitive rationality. [D 14] [A 5] [B 5]\n\nHegel and its theory have pushed a new height of Western philosophy, and he founded the largest objective idealist system in Western philosophy, and systematically expounded the dialectics. His theory and learning have had a far-reaching impact on modern philosophy and is called Hegelism.\n\nA variety of philosophical movements developed from Hegel's ideological system. Its focus is the historical and logic as the master, history, it understands \"all reasonable is reality\" from different perspectives; logic, it has found the \"truth is the whole\".\n\nHegel believes that the focus of philosophy is to give up division and reach unity. He said the previous era is thinking and existence, ideal and realistic split, freedom and inevitable, personal and social, unlimited and limited, unity and diversity split.\n\nHe started from Kant's \"rationality of the mind and the active role of experience\", but opposed to Kant's \"World of Experience World and the world\" world \"and considered the same base rational structure as the soul. The universality he believes is not from special abstraction, but includes special inside, which is specific; the unified unity is also non-detached, and the aligned unity is included, but the unity of them. Alternatively unified. The above integration is his theory: the most authentic unparalleled overall \"absolute spirit\" is also the unity of opposition.\n\nHe believes that in order to achieve this \"absolute spirit\", it takes three phases, from logic, natural to the spirit, that is, from thinking to the existence, and then to the unity of the unity, thereby completing his unity.\n\nIn this regard, social and historical phenomena have been given a new and new dominant position in philosophy. He also returned ethics to this area, thus making important routes in ethics theory and the understanding of ideas. [a 11] [B 9] [D 15] [B 10]\n\nFrom the middle of the 19th century, Western philosophy entered the modern philosophy. Because in the mid-19th century, Europe's industrial revolution was completed.\n\nModern philosophy, especially in the middle and late philosophy of the 19th century, there is a paragraph of uncle, Xin Kantism, New Hegelism, Marxism. However, at this time, the philosophy and the later existence, phenomenon, etc. in contemporary generally be \"continental philosophy\", and \"Analysis philosophy\" developed by rigorous logic and preliminary analysis after the twentieth century has become two major weeks with different styles. Philosophical model.\n\nThere are two mainstreams in Western philosophy in the 20th century:\n\nModern philosophy mainly includes the following trends. [A 12] [B 11] [D 16] [B 12] [D 12] [C 6]\n\nHistory philosophy:\n\nMainstream Marxism:\n\n\"Philosophy is only continuously explaining the world, and it is related to the present.\"\n\nWestern Marxism:\n\nHegelism:\n\nStructuralism:\n\nAnalysis philosophy:\n\nTentative:\n\nNew Kantism:\n\nLogic motivism:\n\nLanguage philosophy:\n\nPhenomenology:\n\nmaterialism:\n\nNew Thomasism:\n\nScience philosophy:\n\nWillism:\n\npragmatism:\n\nExistentialism:\n\nExplanation:\n\nVarious variants of idealism are quite popular in the 18th century to the early 20th century philosophical circles. The prior artist of Kant's claim is that people's understanding of things is bounded because many things are not available in objective judgment. His work issued in 1781, \"purely critical criticism\" tried to adjust the two major philosophical factions in the 18th century: empirical and rationalism, and establish a new foundation for studying. [64]\n\nGermany's idealistism is the \"spiritual phenomenology\" published in Hegel in 1807. Hegel admits that his own philosophy is not new, but his goal is to complete the incomplete system of previous philosophers. Hegel believes that the focus of philosophy is to give up division and reach unity. He said the previous era is thinking and existence, ideal and realistic split, freedom and inevitable, personal and social, unlimited and limited, unity and diversity split. He started from Kant's \"rationality of the mind and the active role of experience\", but opposed to Kant's \"World of Experience World and the world\" world \"and considered the same base rational structure as the soul. The universality he believes is not from special abstraction, but includes special inside, which is specific; the unified unity is also non-detached, and the aligned unity is included, but the unity of them. Alternatively unified. The above integration is his theory: the most authentic unparalleled overall \"absolute spirit\" is also the unity of opposition. Hegel believes that there are three phases to achieve this \"absolute spirit\", from logic, natural to spirit, that is, from thinking to the existence, then to the uniform process, from Complete his unity. He also returned ethics to this area, thus making important routes in ethics theory and the understanding of ideas. [a 11] [B 14] [D 15] [B 10]\n\nMarxist philosophy is a philosophical system established by Marx and Engels. It believes that practice is the only standard for the truth of philosophy. Philosophy should be accompanied by the development of society, science and technology and culture [65] [66]. Its main ideological system was founded in 1970s, and the establishment of Engels in the 1970s. In the 1920s, a complete system was formed in the Soviet Union - dialectical materialism and historical materialism. This system has developed under later socialist countries. [66] Marxist philosophy declared that his theoretical system was scientific, and it was considered that philosophy can become part of science [65]. At the same time, Marxist philosophy believes that philosophy also has ideological properties [65] [66].\n\nIn addition, Marxism also refers to a variety of communist movements in politics, such as the Soviet Marxism, which was revised by Lenin, called Marxism, and the Treses of the Russian revolution and later established Communists. Its bypass includes the Trotsky and the Marxism, Mao Zedong Leninism, etc. [A 13] [D 17] [B 11] [B 12] [B 13] [D 12] [C 8]\n\nThe pragmatic philosophical faction produced in the 1970s has become a mainstream trend in the United States in the 20th century. The research on law, politics, education, society, religion and art has produced a lot. Practicalism also tries to find an intermediate road in rationalism and empiricism, is the appropriate recipient of \"empirical ideas and human comparison with religious needs.\"\n\nThe phenomenon is the theory of German philosopher Hussell in 1900, emphasizes the distinction between direct intuitive and experience, and believes that philosophy (or at least psychology)'s main task is to clarify the association between the two, and Intuitive understanding of essence. The phenomenon is a philosophical study on experience structure and consciousness structure. As a philosophical movement, the early 20th century was founded by Edmund Hiser, followed by him in the University of Germany and a followers in the University of Munich. After this, phenomenon spread to France, the United States, and other regions, and far beyond the context of early Hussel. [67] Other major philosophers include Heideg, Morris Mero Pont, and Emanuel Lavina.\n\nThere is a philosophical orthodontic thinking, which is used in the early 19th century to some philosophers of the twentieth century, although their studies have a huge difference [68] [69], but they all believe in philosophy Thinking starting in human subjects - not just thinking, including behavior, perception, human individual [70]. The existentialism emphasizes individuals, independent, subjective experience, and believes that people have the meaning of people to get answers to the answer from rational thinking [71]. In existentialism, the characteristics of the individual's starting point are called \"attitude existing\", or a feeling of obviously a lost or confusing world [72]. Many existentists also believe that traditional systems and philosophical academics are too abstract and away from human experience, both content and style [73] [74].\n\nThe 19th century philosopher Kerke Gu and Nietzsche were seen as a pioneer of existence, although they did not use this term. However, their influence extends out of existential idea [75] [76] [77]. Kerka Guoler is primarily targeted by Hegel's idealist philosophical system. He believes it neglects or excludes human inner subjective life. Instead of Krkher Guo Her believes that \"truth is subjective\", the most important issue for human human beings is to process individuals and existence problems. Kerkegher as a Christian truth that believes in religious beliefs is a subjective problem, and people should use enthusiasm to think about this problem [78] [79]. Literature (English: LITERATURE), in the broadest sense, is any single written work. More stringent, literary writing is an artistic form, or any single work that is considered to have art or intellectual value, which is usually deployed in a way different from normal use.\n\nIts latin root Literatura / Litteratura (itself originated from Littera: Letter or Handwriting) is used to refer to all written records, although contemporary definitions extend the terminology to text (oral literature) including oral or singing. Literature can be classified according to the fictional work or non-fictitious works, or it can be classified according to the rhyme or the prose; can be further distinguished according to the main forms of long novels, the novels, short novels; works often according to historical periods or to certain aesthetics Features or expectations (art types) are classified.\n\nReflections with language text to reflect the art, including rhyme, prose, scripts, novels, etc., is an important manifestation of culture, with different genres in the inner emotions and reproduction of life and a certain period of life.\n\nThis concept changed its significance over time: Now it can expand the verbal art form of non-book, can cooperate with the language or text itself, so it is difficult to agree on its origin.\n\nThe development of printing technologies makes the distribution and spread of written works, and ultimately leads to online literature.\n\nLiterature is not necessarily objective, a successful writer can show his own subjective views, express their emotions and feelings, but by trying to build a \"objective standard\", When you can help writers to learn about \"readers\" to reflect in the heart of the inner emotional and artistic performance.\n\nSometimes it can also borrow the concept of the idea of \u200b\u200bthe concept, so that the society has different faces to save the situation, such as the rise of women's literature.\n\nThe history of literature is closely related to the development of civilization. If literature is defined as a writing record, the earliest ancient literary work is generally considered to be ancient Egyptian literature [1] and Sumei literature (English: SUMERIAN LITERATURE) [2]. The main instruments in the ancient Egyptian literature (praise poems, prayers and stories) are almost all in the way of poetry [3], but although it can be clearly seen with poetic devices, but the rhythm of poetry is unknown [ 4]. The earliest known literary work is 2700 BC's \"Gilgamesh Shi Shi\" created by Su Men, which describes heroism, friendship, losses and chasing eternal life.\n\nDifferent distinctive literature have different characteristics. There are many in ancient literature about the world's origins and customs, and there are some myths with morality and spiritual meaning. Tutomatic epic in the Iron Age and more about Indian History (English: INDIAN EPIC Poetry) have more information about the author, and many myths are circulated in the way they use orally.\n\nVarious literature can be considered a record of text, and literature itself may be realistic or fiction, but it can be depicted, but some facts, such as the protagonist action and speech, the author's writing style, and the meaning of the text. These plots are not only entertaining, including related information about economic, psychological, scientific, religion, politics, culture and socialism. Studying and analyzing literature is also an important part when studying history. Studying past literature can see different historical periods, their evolution of their society and social norms, even can help understand today's literature, because of the information of ancient Greek mythology, religious classics and related literature. It is more than just seeing this topic from the topic of literature. With the evolution of history (eg, from the book of the economic history or the book of science and evolution), you can see similar content in the science fiction. The authors often add some historical content in their works, such as the Lord Byron in \"Childe Harold's Pilgrimage: Canto I\" to mention Spanish and French by the protagonist Childe Harold, which also mentioned some of the author's ideas [5]. By literary people can continue to discover new information about history, this can be seen from various disciplines in various disciplines. [6]. When people record information in writing, it is easier to pass through this generation to the next generation, and the information left will be more and more. From these information, people can study literature, improve ideas, and expand knowledge, and began research on medical or trade. With the increase and expansion of modern people's learning content, literature will have some differences, and become the foundation of people's research.\n\nMany ancient civilizations have their literature about philosophy or related perspectives, like ancient China, ancient India, Persian and Greek Roman's classical work. Many ancient works, even if there is a narrative form, there is still a moral or teachings, like Sanskrits, \"five volumes\" or Ovid's \"modified\", and later the audience of the drama and satirus There is therefore a literary creation of similar nature begins. Lyrical poetry is often the character of the noble circle, especially in East Asia, many songs are collected by the aristocrats and become poetry.\n\nRomantic abnormal traits in the medieval bloom. At the same time, the rational era has created nationalist epic and philosophical text. Romanticism emphasizes popular literature and emotional investment, slowly seeking realistic reality and naturalist literature. In the 20th century, symbolism looks up, explores the description and development of roles.\n\nFor a long time, China's literature and history and myths have no obvious boundaries, the earliest literature is a record of history and myth. But pure literature has appeared in the week, such as the \"Book of Songs\". Ancient Chinese literature focuses on philosophy, history history, military, agriculture and rhyme. China invented the papermaking and carving printing, and the world's first printing civilization (English: Print Culture) [7]. Many of China's philosophical thinking is the hundreds of sons in the Spring and Autumn Period, and the most important thing has Confucianism, Taoist, ink family and French, and military school books (such as Sun Tzi) began to appear during the Spring and Autumn Warring States. Chinese historical literature has continued from Shang Shu, Spring and Autumn, War National Policy, and History, etc., and has a very detailed information record.\n\nChina's literary achievement is the biggest poetry, from \"Liu\" to Tang Dynasty, poetry has been a huge impact on Chinese literature. Later, in the form of poetry, words, songs, and novels, in Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming Qingqing. The new literature movement promoted by Hu Shihe Chen Duxiu during the Republic of China, believes that work should not only seek form, and should pay attention to the fullness, expression and emotion of the content, and also promote venue literature. During the Republic of China, the martial arts novels were popular at home and abroad, and became the most popular novels at the time.\n\nDuring the period of the People's Republic of China, after the Cultural Revolution, there was a related reflection literature and scar literature, and there was a number of white-minded poets to conduct a large number of creations, and they also replaced ancient poems became the most popular poetry. Later, online literature was raised and became popular business.\n\nAfter retreating Taiwan, the Republic of China has been in the 50 and 1960s, and the four major anti-Japanese novels represents the four major anti-Japanese days as the background, and later there is anti-communist, and the 1960s began, with Qiong Yao as The romance novel represents also begins to popular. In the 1970s, the new modern literature in Taiwan's social research has gradually begun, and the local literary literature that emphasizes the local local local literature. After 1990, the rise of online literature has begun.\n\nChinese classical literature is divided into poetry and text, and Wen is divided into rhyme and prose, and China's lyrical poems and classical Chinese have been more developed.\n\nLiterature is generally divided into novels, prose, poetry, script, and called four major literary genre;\n\nThe script is another ancient literary form, mainly expressing the author's thoughts and feelings through dialogue between different roles. The script can be used for the stage of the stage, or you can read it. Like the Yuanqu, Peking Opera, the Quenstill is part of this part. Many Western drama are accompanied by music and dance, such as opera and musical, ancient Greek drama is currently known in the West's Western drama, tragedy, comedy, tragic comedy, etc.\n\nThere are a lot of literature awards, issued to excellent writers, praise their achievements. Because the scope of literature is wide, many literary awards will depend on style, literary types, language, nationality and other characteristics (such as new writers or novels (English: debut novel), etc.) [11].\n\nThe Nobel Literature Award is an award established by Nobel in the 1895 will, which is a Nobel Prize [12], generally winning the author's overall work, rather than high-specific works [Note 2] . Other awards of other people with: Newstadt International Literature Award, Bark International Award and Kafka Award.\n\nLiterary skills (English: literary technique) is a way of literary creators in literature and a special effect. Literary skills are widely scope, including whether the work is to be called the first person or others, using traditional linear narratives or nonlinear narratives (English: Nonlinear Narrative), or include text options. This allows readers to feel some familiar structures and architectures, such as traditional crime novels, but some author will pay special choices to make readers have unexpected feelings.\n\nThe use of literary skills may also produce new texts, just like Samuel Richards, the early modern novels \"Pamela (English: pamela, or virtue shutard\". \"Pamela\" is composed of many letters, called \"Book Body Tips\". Therefore, \"pamela\" makes everyone noticed the book's novel (English: EPISTOLARY NOVEL), and a previous appearance, but there is no attention to it.\n\nDifferent literary skills and literary means are a bit similar to the relationship between military strategy and military tactics. Literary means is a special structure in the narrative, like metaphor, metaphor, omission, narrative theme (English: Motif (Narrative)) and House, etc., even simple homophones can be used as literary means. Narrative mode (English: Narrative Mode) can also be considered a literary means, such as consciousness.\n\nLiterary criticism refers to the comments and assessments of literary critics to other people, and sometimes it will also be used to improve and enhance literary works. Literary editing (English: literary editor) can also bring similar roles to the author. There are many different kinds of literary criticism, and there will be its theoretical foundation, and different types of literary criticism can comment on various parts of literary works or all levels.\n\n[Edit in Wiki Data] Art (Latin: ARS; French, English: Art; Spanish, Portuguese: Arte; German: kunst) refers to the integration and balance of integrated people with skills, will, imagination, experience, etc., to create an aesthetic The expression model of the instrument, environment, image, action or sound, also refers to the process of sharing beauty with others or humans with deep emotions and consciousness to express existing perceived and personal or group experience precipitation and display. [1].\n\nAll human culture has some form of art and music, and art expression is one of the universal cultural generals.\n\nArt Traditionally include the following types: literary art (including poetry, drama, novel, etc.), visual art (painting, sketch, sculpture, etc.), graphic design, modeling art (such as sculpture, style), decorative art (such as mosaic map Design, etc.) [2], performance art (drama, dance, advertising [3], music, etc.) [1].\n\nIn the 17th century to the 18th century in Europe, art and science entered the critical period of knowledge and mutual inspiration, this process promoted the art and scientific finished products into an important symbol of Western humanistic thinking and civilization. [4]. The encyclopedia of the European Enlightenment Sports is also a dictionary titled book with the new state of the human groups that have been raised by art and science [5] [6] [7] [8].\n\nFrench and English ART (art) one word from the ancient Greek Latin ARS, the righteousness is \"skill\" [9], although the original meaning is also derived, almost all of the close-related life is closely related. Creative learning.\n\nThe word \"in Chinese came from the\" Han Han Shu \"Wenyuan Biography, Liu Zhen has mentioned\" Calibration Dongguan 5th, Zhuzi, Baijiao \", but the art refers to Six Arts and Structure, etc. The general name of the skills, and the meaning of modern art [10].\n\nIn terms of literature, literature, painting, music, dance, sculpture, architecture, drama, and movies, the knowledge in these areas is sufficient to establish a corresponding learning. In addition, some emerging art sectors such as design, photography, video games (video games (video games), and experimental art are also gradually received by the academic and public, and many art colleges have opened relevant profession [11 ].\n\n\nIn Chinese and English, the names of art and art often have mixed situations, strictly speaking, art corresponds to English, is a broad and wide concept, and the art corresponds to the English, which is a narrow, just the expression of art. One. Art includes \"painting\", \"sculpture\", \"building\", \"literature\", \"music\", \"drama\", \"dance\", \"movie\" and even \"game\", and \"art\" generally refers to \" Painting, \"Sculpture\" as the core of visual art. However, in the daily term, art and art are often equal to the equal sign. In the education sector, there have been controversy, causing the confusion of students related artists.\n\n\nSince the 20th century, it has been constantly emerged in conventional forms of elements other than traditional definition art, such as common \"Technical Art),\" Digital Art \",\" Installation Art \"(Installation ART) , \"Conceptual ART\", \"Behavioral Art\", \"Biological Art\", etc. Such a variety of art forms continue to challenge the limit of the artistic theory. Regarding how art is recognized, it has become an open problem, and it is currently based on the current recognition of art world.\n\nThere are many different functions in history, so it is difficult to abstract the purpose of art into a single concept. This does not mean that the purpose of art is to vague, but there are many different art creations, unique reasons. The purpose of an art will be listed below, which is divided into two types (Motivated).\n\nThe art of no motor means those art that is an indispensable part of human beings. This type of art beyond individual, or is not created for a particular purpose. With this point of view, art and creativity, it is human, and therefore exceeds the practical level.\n\nArtificial art refers to those that are generated by specific purposes. It may be to politically change, express a subject of society, express specific feelings or aimed at attitude, statement of personal psychology, describing another thing, selling products, or as an exchange of tools.\n\nSo far, there is no recognized art classification standard. The factions of each artistic theory have different classification, the more comparable and controversial in the timeline.\n\nIn general, the art can be divided into accordance with the different manifestations and methods.\n\nCompare new branching, the art is divided into:\n\nThe following is a common art category\n\n[Edit in Wiki Data] Linguistics (English: linguistics) is a scientific study on human language [1] [2], and involves analyzing language form, language meaning and context [3]. Traditionally, through the interaction between sound and significance, analyzes human language [4], and discusses social, cultural, historical and political factors affecting the language, and the meaning of language can be defined by analyzing these factors. Context [5]. Linguistics contain several branches. There is an important topic division between language structures (syntax) research and significance (semantic and pragmatic) research. The grammar contains lexical (formation and composition of words), syntax (determined how words constitutes a fracture of phrase or sentences) and speech (sound system and abstract sound units). Voice is a related branch of linguistics, which involves the actual properties of voice (phone) and non-voice sounds, and how they have been received.\n\nUnlike learning language, linguistics is an academic subject related to human \"Chinese development\" (usually only according to language, non-text). Traditionally, linguistics is a branch discipline in cultural anthropology, but the language is now more and more independent. The description of the language and other languages \u200b\u200bsuch as language research, and the history of the development of language.\n\nLinguistics are narrowly defined as scientific methods for researching languages, but we can explore language from various aspects and have related associations with several other intelligent disciplines, and these disciplines have also affected the study of linguistics. For example, symbolics is a related area that involves research on both general tags and symbols in language and language. The Studies of Literary Theory Studies in Language in Literary Art. In addition, linguistics are also known from different fields, like psychology, speech-language pathology, information learning, computer science, biology, human anatomy, neurology, sociology, humanology, and acoustic.\n\nThe history of linguistics is very old. The earliest language of human beings is to study the philosophy, history and literature in the study of philosophy, history and literature. China has produced training in the Han Dynasty. It is known that the earliest language description is the analysis of the Pifanan in the first five hundred years of Sanskin [6]. In India and Greece, the 4th century BC has established a language law. Linguistics history\nModern language is established in the early 18th century, which has emerged with historical comparison.\n\nTraditional linguistics are called language to study ancient literature and written languages. In China, there has been a part of the e-learning, training, and literature. Modern language is dominated by contemporary language and speaking. Generalized linguistics include language.\n\nLanguage other affiliated subjects include the following:\n\nLinguistics branch disciplines include:\n\nThe main research object of modern linguistics is the language and text. Linguistics work is to study:\n\nThe research on language can be divided into total and last time:\n\nLinguistics and Evolution Biology, Sociology, Psychology, Mathematics, Logic, Information Theory, Neurophysiology, Computer Science, Communication Engineering and other subjects have penetrated each other, forming many marginal disciplines:\n\nLanguage is a unique communication method that reflects human civilization in the social and cultural level in human-specific communication methods, reflecting human civilization. Linguistics is to study the language skills of human beings, through analysis and research on spoken, written languages, and lips, and to understand the essence of human language.\n\nIn addition to the understanding of human language, linguistics research also has a variety of application value. In terms of language education, through understanding of language itself, compilation of various dictionary, cultural law, textbooks, and help to improve the difficulties and errors encountered in the process of language learning. In terms of translation in different languages, language theory has more specific guidance for translation and interpretation, and also helps to use technology to translate machine translation.\n\nWithin the vast language of language, there are many emerging branches, focusing on more specific language analysis and description.\n\nSymbolism is a research symbolic humanism. The symbols of research may be individual, or have a symbolic system that will also study the meaning of symbols. How to understand. The symbol of the symbolist study is more than a symbolic symbol of the language ditch, which also extends into various symbols in culture.\n\nTranslation This area includes a written content written or an exit, which may be digital or printing. Simply, the translation is to convert the content from a language to another. Some translators are employed in companies or organization, such as travel agencies or national embassies, which often need to process communication between two languages. Translation can also be carried out using computational linguistics, such as Google Translation is an automated programming tool, which can be transformed between the words or even sentences between two or more languages. Publishers will also need to translate, translation books from a language into another language, making more people can become readers. Academic translations focus on translation in some specific fields, such as technology, science, law, economics, etc.\n\nBiological Linguistics (English: Biolinguistics) is a communication system for researching animals, which may be natural or taught by people. Researchers of biological linguistics want to know the possibility of animal language for a long time.\n\nClinical linguistics is the application of linguistic theory in speech therapy. The speech therapist is treated with people of communication barriers and swallowing disorders.\n\nComputational linguistics are handled in a computer to handle linguistics, that is, the specifications of the algorithm and computational complexity have a careful consideration, so there is some ideal calculated characteristics and its implementation. Computational linguistics also study computer language (including machine language, C language, Java, and wide application C ++, which is the modern common computer language; machine language is 0 and 1 binary language, directly understanding and executing the machine) ) And software development.\n\nEvolution Lingu is a cross-regional study of language generated by human evolution and will also use the cultural evolution of different languages. Evolution Linguistics also studies different languages \u200b\u200baround the world [7].\n\nTheoretical language is used to investigate the common laws and universal characteristics of human language. From the specific language to identify the theory and laws of the universal system. History, referred to as historiography, is a science in which all problems include human society. History is not a creed, teach, literature. The purpose of historical science is to approximate the real situation as much as possible.\n\nHistory, referred to as historiography, is a science in which all problems include human society. History is not a creed, teach, literature. The purpose of historical science is to approximate the real situation as much as possible. Western Zhou has a book, and the history of history, the history is a record person in the west, in the history of the ancient Chinese records, the royal and folk, Tang Shuzong real record, Song Taizong record, clear record is the model of Royal History, History It is the representative of folk history, history is an important part of the ancient Chinese educational education. The history of Europe is a history of Hiros, Herodod, Catholic Church. After the era of Enlightenment, Europe emphasizes rational thinking, such as the Voltai Luyi 14th era. Prussiank emphasized the language and folk investigation and the use of government archives. Langke widespreadly studied the official archives of Prussia, Italy and the German national language, which was heavier. The research content and research theme of the 20th century history expands as socio-economic issues, such as annual approach school, public history, oral history.\n\nBut despite this, talk about the work content of historians, there are still some obvious common nature:\n\nIt is known as the study of historical research, it must choose the topic related to the real past, historian can not fabricate people and incidents that do not match the past, there is a little different from the literature, and historical needs to have evidence, each There must be sufficient evidence as a support behind a sentence, which is known as \"historical\" by historians. However, after the 1970s, with the rise of the so-called modern trend, the Western historiography has a more radical theorist, such as Hayden White, from the perspective of linguistics and rhetoric, analyzes the structure of history. It is not essentially different from history and literature.\n\nHistorians must try to avoid personal subjective opinions when conducting historical compilation, can not show their position during history research, because historians generally believe that their research is to rebuild the real past for people now [1 ], If you join too much your own position, you will be distorted, which will have been abused by the public. In terms of objective, Qian Zhongshu thought that it was difficult to escape the truth, \"Histori is a distortion\" [2]. Although Qian Zhongshu agreed that Sima Guang was writing \"General\" in the wild history novel, \"said\" said the history of history, the wild street talks, that is, it is not allowed to take the letter of person, and every effort, the human being, and light No name is also known. \"[3]\n\nIn addition to rebuilding the past, historians is to explain why these things will happen, and these things are the meaning of modern people. Therefore, historians are different from lawyers and politicians, and the historians' research reading history is ink thinking about hiding the context behind history, and not ink to judge the ancients. Historians must explain the past through a variety of different perspectives, rather than using the descendants of the future.\n\nTraditionally, historian is to find a big question, and this big problem is usually inseparable from the people of the same era, which makes historians different from simple ancient times. addiction. Mi Ma Qian, one of the founders of China's history, presented the historical research objectives of \"the trend of the heavens, the turns of the ancient and present, and the words\". Historic scholars will study the success of the ancient political reform in order to solve the shortage of political reform, and should not have no reason to study a topic that has nothing to do with the present life. History is not cumulative in order to accumulate knowledge; in turn, it is a planned study for a particular purpose. However, in the late 20th century, with the rise of micro-history and cultural history, the traditional historical view was challenged. The emerging school under the guidance of feminism and cool and cool, criticized traditional historiography and social ruling elites, pointing out that its research direction often ignores marginal crowds and underlying society.\n\nTraditional Chinese historical works can be divided into the following three genre:\n\nHistory method. General History Research Association adopts historical collections and editing.\n\nPolitics history | Ideological history | Economic history | Legal history | social history | Population history | Cultural history | History | Medical history | Women history | Foreign history | Education history | Communication history | Art history | literature history | History history | historical language Learn | Spectrum | Fang Zhixue | History Philosophy | Jinshi | Military History | History Geography | Medical History |\n\nThe historical first-level disciplines defined by the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China have: archeology, Chinese history, world history.\n\n\n\n[Edit in Wiki Data] Geography (English: GeoGraphy) is about Earth and its characteristics, residents and phenomena [1]. It is a discipline system for studying the interaction between the surface of the Earth's surface, and the discipline system of its spatial differences and changes.\n\nGeographicists are traditionally be regarded as the same class with mapologists, and believe that both are famous and numbers. Although many geographicists have experienced the training of local names and maps, both are not their most concerned. Most geographicists have studied many phenomena, process, characteristics, and interrelationships in human and natural environments in space and time. Because the space and time affected a variety of topics such as economics, health, climate, plants and animals, geography is a highly interdisciplinary discipline.\n\nGeography as a discipline is mainly roughly divided into two areas: natural geography and human geography. Natural geography investigates the natural environment and how to cause terrain and climate, water, soil, vegetation, various phenomena of life and their relationship. Human geography focuses on how human beings are manufactured, treat and manage, and how human space is affected. Because the above is the reason, the third field of use of different methods is used in environmental geography. Environmental geography in the research results of natural geography and human geography, analyzes and commenting the relationship between human and nature, and proposes human conquest nature, transforming nature to adapt to its own sustainable development safety status and technology (including production technology and Conditions of System Technology.\n\nThe word from Ancient Greek \u03b3\u03b5\u03c9\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 (Romanization: Geographia), is composed of Geo (meaning \"earth\") and graphein (meaning \"writing\"), which means \"a description of the land\". The earliest man using Geography is Eloranti, he uses this word to represent the study of the topic scenery.\n\nIn ancient China, the establishment of land or Justuctive, geographicity refers to the environmental situation of mountainous land [2]. After Japan, after the Meiji Destination, the word English Geography translated into translation as geography, and then passed into China.\n\nIn 1902, the Emperor Guangxu received Zhang Baixi, and promulgated the \"Qin Decoration\", in the formal school, there were two in history, and two. After Zhang Baixi, Wu Xiun went to Japan to study education, 1903, Zhang Baixi, Zhang Zhidong, who was responsible for education reform, and Rongqing recommended to redeem the school stages [3]. After re-redefining the charter, it is regulating the primary elementary school in Japan, and the history, the second sect, renamed history and geography. Then, geographic nouns are popular in China.\n\nTraditionally, geography has four basic research categories [4]:\n\nIn contrast, modern geography is a comprehensive coverage of the relevant discipline, and the geography circle has been scientific and dialectical, and the dialogue after the measuring revolution and the various philosophical ideas enters the school. The modern geography is to seek understanding space. In-depth complexity of human and nature - not only \"knowing it\", but to \"know it,\" Geography as \"Human Social Science and Natural Science Bridge\" is divided into two major branches - human geography and natural geography [5]. The earliest books in Ancient China include \"Yong Gong\" and \"Shan Hai Jing\". Ancient geography mainly explores the measurement methods related to the shape, size, or describes known areas and countries.\n\nGeographicists are traditionally be regarded as the same class with the map, and believe that both are studying place names and numbers. Although many geographicists have experienced the training of local names and maps, both are not their focus. Geographicists have studied many phenomena, process, characteristics, and interrelationships of human and natural environments in space and time. [6] Because spatial and time affecting a variety of topics such as economy, health, climate, plants and animals, geography is a highly interdisciplinary discipline.\n\nGeography as a discipline can be roughly divided into two larger areas: human geography and natural geography. The former focuses on how human beings build, how to treat, treat and manage and manage how to affect its occupied space. The latter investigates the natural environment and how to cause various phenomena of climate, vegetation, life, soil, water and terrain and their interrelationships [8]. Because the above is the reason, the third field of use of different methods is used in environmental geography. Environmental Geography Integration Humanities and Natural Geography and Observing the Interrelationship between Humans and Nature. [6]\n\nNatural geography focuses on geography of geography. Its goal is to understand the rocky circles of nature, hydrological circles, large air circles, soil circles (Pedosphere) and biospheres (global plants and animal phase modes). Natural geography uses biology to study, is a systematic geography, understanding global flora and animal zone pattern, using mathematics, physics to study the exercise of the earth itself and its relationship with other solar system, is research Disciplines of global changes in position and space. Natural geography can be classified as the following rough category:\n\nHuman geography is a branch of geography, focusing on studying interaction patterns and processes between humans and many environments. He contains the ingredients of social sciences such as humanities, politics and economic levels. Although the main focus of human geography is not the substantial landform of the earth (see natural geography), because various human activities occur in substantially land, it is actually not mentioning the substantial landform to discuss human geography and impossible. Environmental geography is just a bridge used as both. Human geography can be divided into many different rough categories (see Human Geography), for example:\n\n\n\nIn response to different periods, many methods appear and applied in human geography research, including:\n\nEnvironmental geography is a branch of geography, describing human relationships from spatial levels and the relationship between the natural world. Environmental geography has aware of human geography and natural geography, and also needs to have awareness of human society as a conceptualization environment.\n\nEnvironmental geography has become the increasing specialization of the above two disciplines as the bridges of human geography and natural geography. In addition, the relationship between human and environment has changed in globalization and technology development, and it is necessary to understand this relationship between this changing and dynamic. Examples of the research category of environmental geography have disaster management, Environmental Management, sustainability and ecological politics (ECOPOLITICS) or Political Ecology.\n\nGeomatics is a branch of geography, which appears first in the 1950 Geographic Measurement Revolution (Quantitative Revolution). Geographic Information includes traditional spatial technology and computer applications that use local graphics and surveylation. Geographic Information is a universal subject with other disciplines using geographic information systems and remote sensing methods. Geographic Information also causes the revival of some geographic departments. This phenomenon especially in the 1950s experience in North America in North America.\n\nGeographic Information includes a wide range of disciplines including spatial analysis, such as maps, geographic information systems, remote sensing detection and global positioning systems.\n\nRegional geography is a branch of geography, she studies the region of different sizes on the Earth. Its main purpose is to understand or define the uniqueness or characteristics of individual regions that contain human and natural factors. The attention of regional geography is also placed on Regionalization, including suitable methods to become a region.\n\nRegional geography is also considered to be an inevitable way to study geography (similar to metrics revolution or critical geography), detail the history of geography.\n\nSince the interrelationship of space is very important for geography of synoptic science, the map is a major tool. Geography Analysis In addition to using classic maps, it also fuses modern approach, namely computer-based geographic information systems (GIS).\n\nGeologists use four related methods in their study:\n\nThe map studies the expression of the Earth's surface using symbols (ie, map production). Although other branch disciplines need to use maps to express their analysis, the actual map production theory is very enough to come from other disciplines. The map of the map is generated by drafting technology.\n\nCartography must learn cognitive psychology and people to understand the symbol to express the symbol to express the top of the earth, and learn behavior psychology can guide map readers to make action. They must learn from the earth-making and quite high-order mathematics to understand how the shape of the earth affects the deformation of the map symbol, which is reflected in the plane. The map can be regarded as a seed of large disciplines in geography without disputeously. Most geographicists are fantastic to maps in young ages as an early characterization they will pursue their geography.\n\nGeographic Information Systems, GIS process and stores high-accuracy Earth information in the computer. In addition to other geographical branches, geographic information system experts must understand computer science and database systems. The geographic information system causes a change in map of maps; almost all maps are now helped by geographic information system software. GIS also represents Geographic Information Science, which is the scientific relationship between software and technology using geographic information systems.\n\nRemote Sensing can be defined as a technology and science that achieves information from a distance. The information of telemetry comes from many aspects, including satellite maps, aviation photography, and portable sensors. Geographicists have increasing the Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Data that uses telemetry. The reason is:\n\nThe data obtained by telemetry can analyze or analyze other digital data levels (eg, geographic information systems).\n\nGeostatistics (Geostatistics) Processing the information derived from geographic quantity methods, especially the application of statistical methods to explore geographic phenomena. Geological statistics are widely used in many areas including: water literature, geology, petroleum exploration, weather analysis, urban planning, logistics and epidemiology. The mathematical foundation of geological statistics is from data clustering, distinct analysis, no mother-in-law and other people. The application of geological statistics in the geographic information system, especially in interpolation (estimates) of unsatisfactory points. Geographicists have significant participation in geographical techniques.\n\nGeographic Qualitative Methods, or Ethnography research technology is used by human geography. Cultural geography has traditions with quality studies, and quality studies are also exploited by humanity and sociology. Human geography takes a participant observation and gaining quality data in depth.\n\nThe conception of Milles of Milu is a late Greek writer, believes that it is a geography of geography, and now only one of its successful sections can be known. Anakzand's contribution includes gnomon, although simple but she provides an effective greek tool as a measure of latitude. Thales and Anna Kendan were also praised because of the predictive yaw. The foundation of geography can be traced back to ancient culture, such as ancient, medieval and modern Chinese history. Initially explored geography in the art and scientific level, the map is used to learn from the map (see map history history of cartography), ancient Greek philosophy, ancient Greek literature or mathematics (see Math History of Mathematics), etc. Geography.\n\nThe first person who pointed out that the Earth is the sphere is the dispute between Badenid or Pythagoras. Alikaro La Lei can use the interpretation of the eclipse theory to show that the earth is circular, but he thinks the earth is flat as the other contemporary scholars. Eltostny is one of the people who originally estimated Earth radius [10].\n\nThe first initial exact latitude and longitudinal system is considered to be Xipcha. He uses Babylon Mathematics to perform a Sixty Get Affirmation System. Wire and weft are subdivided to 360 \u00b0, each degree is more subdivided into 60 '(angle). For measurement (the longitude of different positions, he proposed to use the daily etch to determine the difference between the relative time [11]. The Roman Empire Explore the extensive mapping in the new place to provide a highly information to Toller's construct a detailed image ( Atlas). The results of Ptle Tervance Yanpatas, using coordinate network (Grid System) and 56.5 miles on the map [12].\n\nThe Empire of the Roman Empire is transferred from Europe to Islamic World by Europe. [13]. Scholars include Abu Abd Allah Muhammad Al-Idrisi, Ibbd Allah Muhammad Al-Idrisi, Iben Batuhammad Al-Idrisi, and Iben Herle Tower. In addition, Islamic scholars translate and interpret the early works of the ancient Rome and ancient Greece, and build wisdom (House of Wisdom) as the above use in Baghdad [14]. In the third century, geography research methods and geographical literature writing in Chinese history and geographical literature were more complicated in Europe [13]. Chinese geography, such as Liu An, Shen Kui, Fan Cheng, Zhou Daguan, Xu Xiake, etc. Writing a lot of important indices, but after the 17th century, there are many geographical concepts and methods of Western geography by China.\n\nDuring the 16th to 17th century, the explorers were discovered and occupied by Christopher Columbus and other new land, which requested geographical materials more accurate, and a more robust theoretical basis. Geographia Generalis, which is \"Geographia Generalis\", is the first class of new scientific geography, from Gerardus Mercator and Bernhardus Varenius. example.\n\nGeography is identified as an independent academic subject in the 18th and 19th century and has become a classic course in Europe (especially Paris and Berlin). During the 19th century, many geography associations developed, including the Emperor of the Paris Geography in 1821 (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de g\u00e9ographie) [15], the Emperor established in 1830 Royal Geographical Society [16], Russian Geographical Society, Russian Geographic Society, 1851 (American Geographical Society) [18] in 1888, established in 1888 Geographic Association [19]. The impact of Emanuel Kant, Alexandria von Humboldt, Carl Lee, and Vidal de la Blache can be regarded as a geographical transition from philosophy to a transformation point.  In the past two centuries, technological progress such as computers, such as computers, etc., the development of geographic information, such as participating in observation and geological statistics as geographic research. In the 20th century, the Geographic Academic experienced four processes: environmental decisions, regional geography, measurement revolution and critical geography. Because Earth science pursues the relationship between the world with a full coverage, interdisciplinary connection is largely strengthened in geography, geology, economics, sociology, and population statistics.

It is both a theoretical discipline, also an application discipline, including two major areas of theoretical psychology and application psychology [2].\n\nPsychology research involves awareness, feeling, perception, cognition, emotion, personality, behavioral and interpersonal relationships, affecting the development of other disciplines, such as education, management, communication, sociology, economics, mental school, Statistics, and literature, etc. On the one hand, attempts to use brain operation to explain the basic behavioral and psychological function of individuals. At the same time, psychology also tries to explain the role of individual mental function in social behavior and social power. Psychologists are engaged in basic research to describe, interpret, predict, and control behavior. Applying psychologists also have the fifth objects - improving the quality of human life. These goals constitute the foundation of psychology.\n\nIn order to study the behavior of human beings, early psychologists will speculate on the environment, physiology (such as: brain damage, causing dopamine, etc.) and some particular factors.\nBut this experimental method has always been discussed and controversial. However, with the advancement of science and technology, people use nuclear magnetic resonance, tomography, and develop more mature questionnaires to study human psychology. Sometimes patients with partial injuries, psychologists also understand why the function of each part of the head is observed by observing the brain activities of these people. [3]\n\nThe word \"psychology\" (psychology) in the Sen language is composed of Greek Stem, \"Soul\" (\u03c8\u03c5\u03ae) and \"Research\" (\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2), earliest by Croatia's poet Mark Maroliqi.\n\n\"Psychology\" translated name, through the relevant research and psychology of history, there is a direct relationship with Chinese Ming Dynastics, Song Agency, and Song Ming Confucian Tudo, Tudo [4].\n\nIn 1890, William James defined psychology as \"science, including psychological phenomena and psychological state\". This definition has been widely circulated for decades. However, this meaning has been questioned by some of the radical lines, especially John .b. Watson and other efforts. Watson defines psychology as information useful for control behavior in the 1913 declaration. Similarly, since James defined it, this word stronger implies the technology of scientific experiments. [5]\n\nEarly psychological research is a scope of philosophy, called philosophical psychology. The study of philosophical psychology can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as Egypt, Greece, India and Huaxia. The ancient China believes that people's sexual ideas are borne by certain organs, and their events will reflect in the organs, such as \"the officials of the heart\" (\"Mencius\"), \"people are in the brain\", \"Head of God\" The residence of \"Spring and Autumn Fortune\"). \"God-shaped\", \"shaped\" and other ideas have many elaborates in the \"Yellow Emperor's Internal Classics\". There are many examples involving medical psychology. Plato's philosophy of binary coexistence, some people think that Aristotle's \"The Soul\" is the work of the earliest discovery of psychology. Through long-lasting evolution, slowly produce a wide variety of disciplines, including the psychology of people's understanding.\n\nPhilosophical psychology is mainly four major issues that explore mental relationships, natural and educational, free will and decisions, and sources of knowledge. Its early theory has a dollar, binaryism, environmental decisions, spiritual decisions, etc. Modern philosophical psychology is three major ideological geography, including rationalism, empirical and romanticism. As the German psychologist Abinhaos said: \"Psychology has a long past, but only has a short history.\"\nIn the medieval Islamics and psychology, clinical psychotherapy has begun [6] and experimental research [7] [8].\n\nAlthough psychology experiments can be traced back \"Optics\" (1021) (1021) [7] [9] [7] [9] However, psychology is started in 1874, and the physiology of Germany was initiated in 1874. Scholar William Fengter issued two psychological textbooks - \"Principles of Physiolog Psychology -, boldly declares in the preamble:\" To establish a new scientific field \"; Fengter also Therefore, it is called \"parent of psychology.\" [10] In 1875, Leipzi University hired Vonte for professor; in 1879, he established the world's first special psychological laboratory at Leipzig University, attracting students from all over the world. After more than 10 years, it is in the 1890s, and the university winds of the United States will explore this move, establish a dozens of psychology laboratories, especially in 1892, 20, this year is also the establishment of the American Psychology. It is usually the time for the birth of scientific psychology in 1874. This time is late for many natural sciences from philosophy to form an independent discipline. Fengter is also the first person to call himself as a psychologist. Other early and important psychologists include Ai Binhaos. At the end of the 19th century, the psychoanalysis of Sigmund Freud was built in the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nGerman psychologist William Vind is considered to be a person who introduces experiments into psychology research, known as \"the father of experimental psychology.\" [11] In 1879, he established the first psychology laboratory at Leipzig University. [11] Fengter focused on the elemental decomposition of the psychological decomposition, because the latter made a breakthrough in analytical substance elements at the time. Although Fengter himself is not a constructist, his student Edward B \u00b7 Tienna became the thinker of constructor, opposite the functionalist. Tienna is an important person of American early psychologists.\n\nFunctionism is born relative to structuralism, and is affected by American philosophers, scientists, psychologists William James. James believes that psychology should have practical value, and psychologists should find a scientific way beneficial to people. His works \"Psychology principle (English: Principles of psychology\" [12] published in 1890, there are many paving problems, providing a direction for subsequent scientists. Other main functionists include John Dewey and Harvey Carl (English: Harvey Carr).\n\n\nOther 19th century outstanding characters have German psychologists Herman Abinhaus, he is a pioneer of studying memory experiments, founding a quantitative model of learning and forgotten in Berlin Humbolda University. [13] Soviet psychologist Ivan Petrovich Bavov, who found \"classical constraint\" when experimenting with dogs and applied its application with humans. [14]\nSince the 1950s, Fengter, James, Ai Binhaus developed more experimental technical directions to the experimental technical direction of experimental psychologists more trend to study cognition - paying attention information and information processing - the ultimate evolution is cognitive Part of the science. [15] At earlier, this is considered \"revolutionary\" development [15]\n\nAustrian doctor Sigmund Freud began researching spiritual analysis since the 1990s until he died in 1939. Psychoanalysis is a method of research awareness, explaining experience; it is a theoretical system for human behavior; it is a method for psychological, emotional treatment, especially for psychotherapy for subconscious conflicts. [16] Many theories in the mental analysis of Freud Based on interpretation, internal provincial law and clinical observation. The mental analysis is widely circulated, because its research object involves the subconsciousness of gender, depression, and psychological development. These issues were listed as a social taboo at the time, and Freud provided catalyst, making problems can be discussed in formal socialization. Clinically, Freud is the pioneer of freelance associations, and he is also studying in the treatment of dreams. [17] [18]\n\nFreud's influence on the Swiss psychiatric physician Carl Jerge, the latter analysis psychology and depth psychology complementary. In the 20th century, leaf psychologists studied mental analysis, psychology, mental illness treatment, and philosophy. These famous scholars include Aik Ericson, Merlanti Klein, Donald Venec, Carren, Erich From, John Bobby, and Flow Eider's daughter Anna Freud. In the past 20 century, mental analysis derived different branch schools, many of them were divided into new Freud school. [19]\n\nPsychoanalysis and its treatment are criticized by many people, such as Hans Eisenke, and philosophers Carl Popper. Popper is a scientist philosopher who believes that mental analysis is wrong as science, [20], and Eiseni claims that the principle of mental analysis does not match the experimental data. By the end of the twentieth century, the Psychology College of American Colleges and Universities became more inclined to emphasized, and the theory of Freud was marginalized and claimed to \"dry the old death\" history. [21] At the same time, the researchers maintain Freud's scientific position in the field of neuroplast analysis, [22] and other human literary scientificers are solid Freud, but they are not scientists, but a ... Interpretator. \"[21]\n\nIn the past 20th century, the behavioral school dominated the psychology at the time, and its advocacy is: \"Seeking to understand how specific environmental stimulation controls specific types of behavior [23]. It advocates that psychology should analyze the environmental conditions of the first line, that is, before behavior, and for a body to generate a reaction or inhibit the reaction to provide activity places. Therefore, they should refer to behavior as a body understanding, predicting, and control, and thus make corresponding results. Based on strict control and emphasis on experimental and variables, behavioralism has an important impact on later psychology research. Its representative figures are Shi Jinner, but its inherent cognitive process is to save, in the near future, the popular cognitive approach is to pay attention to the internal cognitive process of the previous neglected, representing the characters, there is a Piajie, Miller, Simon, etc.\n\nToday, the world's main psychological schools have five views, each of which emphasizes the different aspects of behavior and psychological process. It mainly includes neuropsychology, mental analysis, behavioral psychology, humanistic psychology, cognitive psychology [24]. [25]\n\nIn the 1950s, under the influence of behavioralism and mental analysis, humanistic psychology was born. [27] Applying phenomenology, interactive subjectivity, first person's perspective, humanism attempt to capture the whole person - rather than personality or cognition. [28] humanistic psychology focuses on the basis of human unique issues, such as personal freedom, growth, self-realization, identity, death, loneliness, freedom and significance (English: meaning (interiStential). The human process is characterized in that it is focused on subjective expensive, refuses fate, and focusing on the enthusiasm of growth rather than pathological factors. Some people's founders, such as American psychologists Abraham Maslow, founded the theory of the needs of the needs; Carl Roshez created a personal center treatment. After that, positive psychology analyzes humanism and further scientific analysis.\n\nWolfgang Crust, Marcos Weto, and C\u00f4te d'Ivo Kufka jointly founded a complete psychological school. This psychological study is established in the individual experience as a whole. The molecular structure of the corresponding substance is produced in the early 19th century in Germany, Austria. Decomposed psychology did not decompose thinking, behavior into a small element, but insisted on the importance of experience as a whole, and considered that the overall difference was different from partially added.\nDelicate Psychology should be confused with Fritz Pols (English: Gestalt Therapy), the latter only associated with the completed psychology on the appearance.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, the American original analystist Roculo Mei was in the influence of German philosopher Martin Heideg, Danish philosopher Soren Obe Kerka, Learn the path of learning. This includes psychotherapy.\n\nThere is different from other people's school, namely human neutral perspectives, and anxiety positive perspectives. [29] The presence of a presence is focused on the humanistic theme, such as death, free will, meaning, and believes that the meaning can be changed, or a change in way. [30] For the authenticity of death and future, people usually encourage people to accept freedom, despite anxiety.\n\nAustria's existential psychiatrist, the massacre survivor Victor Frank learned from concentration camp, [31] summarizes the presence of different versions, this method focuses on existenceism, different from Adler's Nietzscheism The power will or the cheerful principle of Freud. [32]\n\nSwiss Psycho Analysis Lutidi Bins Wange, American Psychologist George Alexander Kelly and Mi (May), Frankl, is also considered to be a scholar. [33]\n\nCognitive psychology research psychological activities, including solving problems , Perception, memory, learning, etc. As part of cognitive science, this psychological branch is closely related to other disciplines, including neuroscience, philosophy, linguistics.\n\nNomi Jumsky triggered a psychological \"Cognitive Revolution\" when the \"stimulation\", \"corresponding\" and \"strengthen\" in criticism behavior concept. Jumsky's debate is applied to complex human behavior in a superficial manner, especially in the field of language acquisition. There is a hypothesis that human nun has a \"inner\" language acquisition function, but for behavioralism, this problem is all behaviors, including language, must be obtained by learning and strengthening. Social learning theorists, such as Alport Ban Dula, the child's living environment helps behavior improvement.\n\nAt the same time, technological progress helps people regain psychological activities and expressions, such as cognition, etc. British Neuroscience Charles Scott Sun Lington and Canadian Psychologist Donald Herb application experiments summarize the link between psychological phenomena and human brain structure and function. The rise of computer science and artificial intelligence makes human information processing to mutually comparison with mechanical information processing. Research on cognition is applied to World War II for understanding weapons operation. In the late twentieth century, cognitiveism became a unified fancy style of psychology, and cognitive psychology became popular branches.\n\nCognitive psychology believes that concealment of psychological activities should be studied in a scientific way, and psychologists have found two concepts: the threshold stimuli and the inheritance memory, the subconsciousness of the corresponding mental analysis or the accidental formation behavior of behavior. Behaviser elements and cognitive psychology are integrated into a foundation for cognitive behavioral therapies. This psychotherapy is created by American psychologists Albert Ellis and psychiatrist Aaron T \u00b7 Baker. Cognitive Psychology and Other Disciplines, such as mental philosophy, computer science, neuroscience, and a cognitive science that is classified.\n\nBiological psychology or behavioral neuroscience from bio-angle research behavior and psychological process. There are different professional branches in biological psychology. For example, physiological psychology uses animal models, especially mice, to study nerve, gene, and cellular functions in learning, memory, fear. [34] Cognitive neuroscientists use neur imaging tools to study the relationship between nerve and human psychological activities, and neuropsyter use psychological assessment to conduct scientific research, such as the degree of cognitive deletion of cognition.\n\nThe research and application of clinical psychology includes understanding, prevention, relieving psychological pain and disorders, promoting mental health and personal growth. Although clinical psychologists also participate in research, teaching, consultation, court testification, procedures and management, but the center of the branch is psychological assessment and treatment. [35] Some clinical psychologists focus on clinical monitoring of patients with brain damage, and this area is known as clinical neuropsychology (English: Clinical Neuropsychology). In many countries, clinical psychology is subject to regular mental health.\n\nThe efforts of clinical psychologists have been affected by many treatment programs, all programs include professional relationships between professionals and patients (usually personal, couple, family, or small groups). Different therapeutic practices are associated with different theoretical perspectives, using different processes to establish a combination of treatment, explore psychological causes, encourage new methods to think, feel, and action. The four major theoretical views include psychotropic treatment (English: psychodynamic psychotherapy), cognitive behavioral treatment, presence - humanistic treatment and system / home treatment (English: family therapy). At present, there is a trend that some psychologists are working hard to integrate various treatment factions, especially in the absence of cultural, gender, spirit, and sexual orientation, this trend is more significant. [36] [37] Under rich research results, there is evidence that the effects of the major treatment factions tend to equally, and share the same infrastructure, and can form a strong psychotherapy combination. Because of this, more psychological training courses have adopted a discharging treatment trend (English: Integrative psychotherapy).

Perception, pay attention, reason, reason, thinking, solving, memory, learning, language, and emotions are in its research field. Classical cognitive psychology and cognitive schools have interrelated, depending on functionalism and experimental psychology, cognitiveism support psychological information processing model.\n\nAt the more wide-area level, cognitive science is a cross-discipline, including cognitive psychology, cognitive neuroscience, artificial intelligence, linguistics, human-machine interaction, calculation of neuroscience, and human logic and anthropology. Computers are often used to simulate such experimentation. Computer simulation provides tools for studying the functional organization of thinking, and the nervous system has provided a degree of scale.\n\nComparative psychology refers to the scientific research of non-human animals, especially those related to system development history, adaptation value, and behavioral development. Research on this area discusses many problems, using many different ways, explores the behavior of different species, from insect to primate. Comparative psychology and other disciplines studying animal behavior, such as animal behavior has a close relationship. [43] Comparative psychology research sometimes causes inspiration to human behavior research, but sometimes the association is very contradictory, such as the sociology proposed by Edward Wilson. [44] Animal models are often used to study the neural treatment related to human behavior, such as the use of animal models in cognitive neuroscience.\n\nDevelop psychology focuses on the development process of human will in life, trying to understand how people consciously, understand, and action in the world, and study how these phenomena changed as age. These research may focus on cognition, emotion, morality, social, and nerve development. Researchers use a range of special ways to explore children's cases to make observations in natural environments, or simply interact with them in their experiments. These experiments are often present in a game or an activity, both fun, and scientific significance; researchers even designed a very dexterous way to study the psychological activities of baby. In addition to studying children's psychology, developing psychologists also study the age of human life, especially in certain time periods (such as teens and elderly). Develop psychologists designed a complete set of psychology theories to support their research.\n\nEducational Psychology is to study the learning, efficiency, teaching psychology and schools in the process of education as a social psychology as an organization. Children's psychologists, such as Livi Vigoski, let the Piam, Jerome Brun, Bernard Luskins, etc. have an important impact on professors and teaching practice. . In many countries, educational psychology is a compulsory course for teachers.\n\nSchool Psychology (English: School Psychology) combines educational psychology and clinical psychology, trying to understand, students who have learned obstacles; cultivate high-quality students; promote adolescence (English: prodial behavior) behavior; or advocate safety, Mutual help, efficient education environment. School psychologists are in many fields, such as educational behavior assessments, interventions, prevention, consultation, etc. have been well received, and some are quite accommodation in the research field. [45]\n\nEvolutionary psychology from modern evolutionary perspectives to study psychological characteristics - such as memory, perception, language, etc. It tries to explore what human psychological features are adapted to evolution, that is, as a functional product for natural selection and sexual selection. The evolutionary psychologist believes that in the environment of human ancestors, the evolution of psychological adaptation solves the problem of periodicity. Through the evolution of psychological traits and their adaptability, evolutionary psychology provides the most approximate developmental interpretation in other psychology (that is, the evolutionary psychology is the ultimate problem, or \"why\", not approximate, or Ask \"how\").\n\nIndustrial and Organization Psychology (I-O) Applying Psychology Concepts and Methods Optimizing Workplace 's Human Potential. As the branch of I-O, the psychological principle and method of personnel psychology were screened and evaluated to employees. Another Branch of I-O Tissue Psychological Studies Working Environment and Management Style on the Effect of Positive Positiveness, Achievement and Productivity. [46]\n\nPersonality psychology focuses on personal continuity, ideas, emotions - these are called personality. Personality theory is different because of the different schools, and they have different assumptions on the role of latent sings and the importance of the experience. According to Freud, the personality is based on the interaction between this, self and super, this is the so-called spiritual analysis school. [47] In contrast, the characteristic theory tried to use discrete statistics to conduct research, and the species species proposed also have a lot. Early Hans Eisenk models make up the personality consisting of three basic characteristics: exquisite and introvert, neurotic, mental (English: psychoticism). Raymond Carter proposed 16 personality features (English: 16 Personality Factors). Today, the personality dimension model is increasingly valued, such as the DSM-V model (English: DSM-5). At present, it is currently a social cognitive school. In fact, it is initially called social learning theory. It is an extension from the behavior school: the shape of the personality is the behavior of people and people's interaction, and then the American psychologist Ban Dura The theory of the behavior school is more expanded, joining the intrinsic activity - cognitive ingredients, forming a social cognitive theory.\n\nSocial psychology research the views between humans and how they produce contacts, and social psychologists include the impact of others on individual behavior (for example: in public, persuading: persuasion), the establishment, attitude, Or bigger levels, not only the interaction between people, and some people interaction with a group, as the establishment and strengthening of the scribe impression will cause discrimination behavior after it is a classic example. Social Cognition (English: Social Cognition) links cognitive psychology to sociology elements, trying to understand how people handle, memories, and distort society. Population dynamics discloses the essence of leadership, exchanges and other microscopic levels (English: Microsociology) and its optimization. In recent years, many social psychologists have interested in the behavior of the inner hidden attitude, median model (English: mediation (statistics), individual and social value interaction. Therefore, research on human society can be found to lead to psychological disorders. Some sociological concepts applied to psychological disorders include social roles, patient characters, class, life events, culture, migration, etc. [48]\n\nIt is derived from Maslow's humanistic psychology to psychology. The experimental scientific technique is used to study the happiness and strength of human beings. Unlike traditional clinical psychology, psychology pays attention to health care. At present, the intervention of psychology has obtained some experimental affirmation. A special issue is published in the \"Clinical Psychological Review\" in 2010, which is reported to use some of the intervention methods of characteristic strength in psychology, such as the three weeks. Good things and physical forms of thanksgiving expressions (such as: hug, etc.) that helps life satisfaction. In addition, the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction, MBSR is also proven to be an effective method for treating depression. However, further research is required for the effects of intervention. Positive intervention is still limited, but their effect is considered higher than placebo, especially for physical image lack of people with a better effect.\n\nPsychological research tends to computers, ie knowledge of knowledge from other areas to help understand, explain psychological phenomena. In addition, psychologists use a large number of three-section of Charles Sanders Pierce: interpretation, induction, tracing. Due to the common use of interpretation of natural laws (English: Deductive-Nomological Model), psychologists will also rely on summary logic to explain the problem. For example, evolutionary psychologists try to utilize the survival of admissions to explain psychological traits - such as memory, perception, language, etc., which are naturally selected or sexually selected products.\n\nPsychologists will launch basic research to further understand a certain field of psychology, or to apply research to solve other issues such as clinical, workplace. Master's clinical professional meeting at the same time and teacher student research methods and evidence-based practices. The Psychology Association will also assist in establishing specifications, such as moral, training, research methods, professional operations, etc. In addition, according to different countries and regions, psychological services or \"psychologists\", they are also often requested to obtain practices.\n\nThe results of controlling the variable observation of variables in various situations in various situations in the control experiment context. Statistical analysis of the results, the effect of controlling the effects of unrelated variables, and inference: whether the variable has an effect on variables, that is, whether it has a causality between variables and variables (generally finding the correlation of both. Then confirm the causal relationship. Will also find the correlation coefficient of both according to data analysis, and then determine if there is research value.\n\nExample: Dog in Pavlov experiment (classic condition reflection). Whenever a bell, the dog secretes a lot of saliva. Experiments involve the independent variable, due to variables (dependent) (Dependent Variable). The bell is IV, the saliva of the dog is DV. The independent variable is a variable in the experimenter, and the variable is variable due to the variable. The experimental method is valued. Credibility and repeatability.\n\nExperiments with human beings have been controlled, such as the consent of the experimental objects, and ensure the principle of voluntary participation. After World War II, in order to avoid the event of similar Nazis abuse experiments, Nuremberg Code was formulated. Soon, many countries (and scientific institutions) received the \"Helsinki Declaration\". In the United States, the Health Center has established an ethical review committee in 1966 (English: INSTITIONAL REVIEW BOARD), in 1974, in 1974, the National Research Law (English: National Research ACT) was prepared in 1974 (HR 7724). All of the above bills advocate the license for researchers to obtain participation before the experiment. A series of influential events The amendments to the bill have led to the research of reflective isotope studies in MIT and Fu Na College, Sandy amine scandal, Wiro Brooke hepatitis experiment, and Stanley Mirgram's authoritative test experiment.\n\nAnimal learning experiments have important auxiliary role in studying human psychology, such as perceptual, emotion, learning, memory, and more. In the 1990s, the Russian psychologist Ivan Petrovic Pavlov utilizes the dog's experiment to showcase the classic conditions reflection. Non-human animals such as primate, cats, dogs, pigeons, rats, and other rodents are often used in psychological experiments, especially for behavioral psychology. In the ideal state, the experimental control group only gives only one independent variable to show its role of the variable. These can get the most approximate results in the laboratory. In contrast, the difference between human living environment and genetic environment is too large, and there are too many variables, so that it is difficult to control important variable data in the population. Of course, it is obvious that the results of animal experiments into humans are obvious. [49] Animal experiment will be subject to relevant constraints, and need to comply with the moral principles set by the Psychology.\n\nThe vast majority of psychology follows the standard scientific methods for research. Psychological researchers try to use the latest theories and assumptions to study data and quality and quantity.\n\nPsychological research methods include interviews, observation methods, etc. Creswell (2003) defines five major qualitative research, including narrative, phenomenological, ethnic, case analysis, and basic theory. Quality researcher [50] sometimes strives to enrich, or criticized, subjective experience or social structures for symbols. Similar explanations or critical perspectives are applied to \"quantitative research\", such as the Nazi experiment of Eric From (English: Authoritarian Personality) or Stanley Mirgram's power yield experiment.\n\nPsychological quantitative research often use statistics to test falseness. Design quantitative research often includes experimental, quasi-experiment, cross-sectional design, case control research and longitudinal study. The measurement and operation definition in the experimental structure is also very important. Statistical methods include Pearson's toss coefficient, variance analysis, linear regression, Logit model, structural equation modeling, hierarchical linear model, etc.\n\nThe study aims to answer individual ideas, feelings, behaviors, known as \"descriptive research\". The orientation of the descriptive study can be quantitative or qualitative. \"Qualitative Research\" is a descriptive study focusing on the observation of the incident, description, is a point of capturing a point of daily behavior and expects to re-discovery or understand in a rough experiment.\n\nJust like Gutogo's research includes observing the social, family, psychologists, by observing human society, professional, and homes. Sometimes participants will be aware that they are monitored and sometimes the opposite. But in any case, when observing the study is underway, the researchers must ensure that strict moral guidelines cannot be made.\n\nPsychology, statistical surveys can be used to measure attitudes, traits, monitoring emotions, check the validity of the test, and other related research projects, etc. Psychological statisticors can use traditional paper, telephone, email, or current popular network, etc., revolve around the theme, and conduct crowd surveys, random surveys, key investigations, sampling investigations. Similar surveys are also used in other applications, such as clinical assessments, personnel assessments.\n\nMainly divided into three kinds\n\nNeuropsychological research methods will compare psychological activities, behaviors, and brain structure, and function. These methods include testing (eg, Wixler IM, Wisconsin Card classification test (English: Wisconsin Card Sorting Test), functional neuroimaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation (English: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation).\n\nCalculation models are often used as tools that are applied and mathematical psychology and cognitive psychology, that is, a computer simulated a particular behavior. [52] This method has its unique advantage. Since modern computer processing information is extremely fast, multiple simulation can be run at the same time, and a large number of statistics are generated in the short term. The model can help psychologists observe the assumption values \u200b\u200bof psychological events, which is not easy to observe in usual activities.\n\nThere are many different models available in the application. Jointism utilizes neural network to simulate the brain. Another way is the image simulation, using variables and rules to simulate different psychological activities. Other types of models include power systems and random processes.\n\nArchives Research: It is to collect a large number of existing information based on certain purposes. By analyzing the relationship between certain phenomena and psychology. Archives research method has broad and narrow scores, broad-screwing research methods in addition to traditional References also include audio-visual imaging materials, narrow archive information including newspapers, magazines, meeting records, government documents, personal letters, etc. The use of archives research methods can make up for other research methods, but there is a disadvantage that needs to be subject to availability.\n\nCriticism of research often includes accusing psychology is \"soft\" science. Scientific philosophers Thomas Kun's 1962 criticism [53] suggesting that psychology is still in the previous form, lack of support theory like mature chemistry, physics.\n\nBecause some of the fields of psychology depends on research methods such as questionnaire surveys, critics believe that psychology is not objective enough. Other points of view believe that the personality, thinking, and emotions of psychologists cannot be directly measured, [54] The result is the subjective report of the investigation subject. [55] [56]\n\nOther critics believe that the statistics are misused. Some research records indicate that psychologists often confuse the statistical relationship between the statistics, and the former often does not matter in practice. Sometimes, the debate occurs inside the psychological community, such as the dispute between laboratory researchers and practical clinicians.\n\nSome observers have discovered conflicts in certain theories and practices - for example, some clinical practice has no theoretical support. [57] Critics believe that more and more psychological training courses have no sufficient scientific basis. [58] Some questioners believe that like \"baby autism help communication\"; it is used to remember to recover, the body shaping exercise; regenerative therapy, etc., although it is very popular, but doubts, and may be harmful to health. [59]\n\nIn today's moral standard framework, some research experiments are not allowed. These experiments violated the American Psychology Association, and Canada involved human experimental moral guidelines, as well as Belmon Report (English: Belmont Report). At present, Moral Guidance stipulates that research on non-human animals can only be carried out in the event of benefits greater than harm. [61] So the research method of psychologists in animal experiments cannot be used in humans.\n\nCollege Psychology Institute has a moral committee to ensure the rights and respect of the research object. Psychological researchers must obtain permission before experimenting to protect human participation in objects or experimental animals. [66]\n\nIn 1959, the statistian Sterling calculated that 97% of psychological experiments supported their initial hypothesis, suggesting the possibility of deviation. [67] [68] [69], Janeri, 2010) [70] found 91.5% of mental / psychological studies certified, issued issues (positive results) are space or earth science 5 times larger. Janer believes that the \"soft\" scientific researchers lack a bondage in their consciousness and subconscious deviation.\n\nIn 2010, a group of researchers announced the systemic experimental object deviation in psychological research (\"Western region, well-educated, industrialized, rich, democratic\"; \"Western, EDUCATED, INDUSTRIALIZED, RICH AND Democratic\"). [71] Although 1/8 of the world is a WEIRD category, the experimenter is called 60-90% of the experiments in Weird objects. The report shows that in Muller-Rial Illusion (English: M\u00fcller-Lyer Illusion), the experimental conclusion of the Weird object and tribal object is great.\n\nThe research area contained in psychology is wide, and many different methods are used to psychological processes and behaviors. Psychology is mainly divided into two major areas of theoretical psychology and application psychology, which can be divided into many sectors, such as educational psychology, metamorphology, management psychology. Sociology (English: Sociology) originated in the late 19th century, is a discipline of a research society [1]. Sociology uses various research methods to conduct an empirical survey [2] [3] and critical analysis [4], with the development and improvement of knowledge systems related to human social structure and activities, and use these knowledge to seek or improve social welfare Target. Sociology has a wide range of research, including institutions or interpersonal interactions of micro sociological levels, social system or structures in macro sociological levels [3], sociology's body has social individuals, social structures, social changes, Social issues, and social control, so sociology usually follow economics, political science, anthropology, psychology, etc., and the field of social sciences. Sociology has considerable extensiveness on research on the subject or research law, and its traditional research objects include social stratification, social class, social flow, social religion, social law, cross-track behavior, etc., including qualitative And quantitative research methods. Since all areas of human activities are shaped under the influence of social structures and individual institutions, with social development, sociology further expand its research focus to other relevant subjects, such as medical, nursing, military or criminal systems, internet Internet, etc., such as, for example, the role of scientific knowledge in social activities. On the other hand, the scope of social science methods is also more extensive. Since the language of the 20th century, cultural transformation also has more more interpretative, philosophical social research model. However, the wave of technology in the end of the 20th century, also brought new mathematical calculation analysis techniques for sociology, such as the individual as this model and social network [5] [6]. Because of its historical background, the center of gravity of sociology research is placed in various life of modern society, or how the contemporary society forms evolution and today's process, not only pays attention to the status, nor to ignore society change. Sociological research objects are wide, small to several people face-to-face, and the social trend and trend of globalization. Family, all kinds of organizations, corporate factories, etc., city, market, political parties, national, cultural, media, etc. are all objects of sociological research, and the common point of these research objects is some social social facts. . Although the definition of \"social\" is still dispatched between different schools, social facts are personal and have an impact on individual behaviors, which is generally accepted by socialists.\n\nIn the early 19th century, Kongde believed that the society of the pastology and advocating force will slowly disappear, with rationality, science, and industrial age is looking up, the conflict between the two is the source of social turmoil. This transitional conflict and conflict is unavoidable during the transition of social institutions. Before the old system disappears, people cannot experience the new system, often need multiple social transformations to change the society [7]. Sociology is developing a social science for social reorganization issues (modernity). The sociologist of the Tulkhe School not only wants to understand what makes social groups aggregate, but also want to understand the development process of social tiles, making \"correction\". Correcting concepts do not suggest that sociologists prepare a \"correct society\" template. Tulkhe people do not think there is an ultimate and perfect society. Simply put, when a group of people interactively form a stable reference architecture, running for a long time, it is \"normal\" for them. When the social system problem has accumulated, this steady state is broken, forming a chaotic, that is, the so-called \"tile\", it forms a pathological state. Therefore, Tulkan believes that sociologists are to identify \"daily normality\" of a society, so that the \"pathological state\" is determined. Sociologists need to continue to observe and analyze, not to find templates, and claim that the ultimate fact is over.\n\nConversely, the sociologist of the Frankfurt School does not explore the method of correcting the society. Because they believe that the correction plan for social illness is often imposed on the vast majority of people with a small group, this will not only solve the problem, but also increase the problem. At the beginning of the 20th century, such as Hawkheimer and Adorno and others, he was influenced by the previous generation of Weber and Qimeier, and the reference Marx's theory, the pessimistic view of the modern society and the capitalism system, especially the society, although height Division, but also produces the splitting of life. Especially in the field of art culture, a large number of replication technologies have caused the loss of artistic spirit. Frankfurt second-generation Habermas inherits the above view, and refers to the American structuralism and symbolic interaction, the continental phenomenology, etc. Society is the way in pessimistic and modernity. The above, similar social conflictism, well-known people such as Darum Dolph, also Marx's class analysis, think that society has the class of resources, and the class of dominance, but not, Marx believes assets The class has a production tool, and the proletariat is bound by the zone because there is no tool. It needs to resist the revolution. It is more political economics, but the conflictists, combined with Weber to the class - join the social status, and believe that society is inequality, from Many aspects, not only economic inequality.\n\nToday, sociologists have a series of research from macro-structured to microscopic behavior, including research on race, ethnic, class and genders, to the individual social relationship model of home structure. The sociology department is divided into more detailed research directions, including crime and divorce, in micro aspects, such as people with people. Some sociologists use quantitative research [Note 1] to describe a social overall structure from quantity to study the predictive social changes and the quantitative model of people's social change reactions. This research method advocated by Razzfeld is now one of the two main methodologies in sociological research. Another major genre of sociological research methods is a qualitative study [Note 2], including historical sociology, participation in observation, depth interview, special group discussions, etc., and analyzed based on qualitative data such as root theory, content analysis and Internal method. Sociologists engaged in qualitative analysis believe that this is a better way, because this can strengthen humanities that understand the \"discrete\" sex society and unique. This approach does not seek consistent views, but can appreciate each other and learn from each other. Mainstream views believe that quantitative and qualitative these two research methods are complementary, not contradictory. Turkan and Weber emphasize the importance of both - the subjective (quality) and objective (quantitative) staggered research, to the later symbolism, the interactive master Bruce is quite emphasized.\n\nThe perspective of sociology is to let us know the society through the way of learning things. Two of these more famous sociological perspectives are \"Sociological Imagination\" and \"Debunking\".\n\"The Ideas of Sociology\" is created by Wright Mills, which means that we can understand the society through \"social imagination\". [8]\n\nAs for the \"cracking puzzle think\" is the concept of Peter Pla. He pointed out that \"there is a motive that there is a truth and cracking puzzle thinking.\" [9] This sentence pointed out that sociologists are concerned with all human activities, but they are not concerned with the fact that the general people are concerned with the facts of the facts, but to think about and crack the puzzle thinking about a questioned mind. .\n\nThe overall study of human changes in social change is long, and the logic and philosophy of sociology have already appeared before they form a discipline. The analysis and research of society is basically stem from Western culture, and philosophical thinking for long-year accumulation, and at least be produced before the Berram era. The origin of more formal social statistics is more dted back to \"End Day Trial\" at least in 1086 [10] [11]. On the other hand, in the medieval Islamic society, there is a trace of early sociology. Many studies have pointed out the first sociologist in history. It is a Arab scholar from North Africa from North Africa - Iben Helestown, Its most famous book \"Historical Introduction\" introduced social science theory of social cohesion and social conflict [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17]. In the seventeenth century, the rationalists represented by Cartesi have noticed the ability of science to discover truth, and start to try to use scientific methods to study social phenomena [18].\n\nEnglish \"Sociology\" (or \"Sociologie\") of sociology, is from Latin \"Socius\", \"- OLOGY\", and Greek \"\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2\" (ie \"l\u00f3gos\", merit The word, knowledge) is combined, and this name was earliered by French essay, Emahahae, Joseph West (1748-1836) creating [19] [20] in an unapproved manuscript at the time. [19] [20]. By 1838, the French scientific philosopher August Confudent (1798-1857) officially established the term \"sociology\" [1]. Confield has used the term \"social physics\" in the early days, but later was misappropriated by others, including the famous Belgian statistical Jacques Kate. Kongde is hoped to form a historical, psychology and economics throughout the social field, and the social development is organized.\n\nSociology as an independent discipline in the nineteenth century in the nineteenth century, it has a close relationship with accidents, but there is a close relationship with the disorders of social operations caused by intense social changes. Since the end of the 18th century, the revolution from Europe has occurred, the first time is the political ideology of the French Revolution in 1789, and the other is beginning to the European and the United States, which has been expanded from the UK. Two major events have enabled Western societies fundamentally transition. After the establishment of capitalism, on the one hand, the productivity has developed a sharp-flying development, making the social economic foundation, ideological concepts and political systems have changed; on the other hand, social operation has also exposed many uncoordinated factors, such as periodic economic crisis, unemployment, Crime, etc. For these issues, traditional methods and original scientific systems cannot make satisfactory explanations and answer, so sociology is born as an independent new discipline that is different from other social sciences.\n\nIn the age of the French Revolution, the Confucian revolution continued to turn, he believes that all kinds of illnesses and issues in society can be eliminated through sociology, this is an introduction to the \"empirical philosophical tutorial\", \" A General View of Positivism clearly proposed an epistemological model. He believes in the \"three-phase law\" in human knowledge, after the phase of the secondary stage and shape, the empirical phase will occupy the final position, and the part of his most important [1 ] [18]. Kongde believes that the society of the pastology and advocating force will slowly disappear, with rationality, science, and industrial age is looking up. The conflict between the two is the source of social turmoil. This transitional conflict and conflict is unavoidable during the transition of social system. Before the old system disappears, people cannot experience the new system, often need multiple social transformations to change the society. [21] Sociology is a social science for social reorganization issues (modernity), which is generated in social transformation to address the uncoordinated factors in social operation and development to seek social and benign operations and coordinated laws. For the content, and this main line runs through the history of the entire sociology.\n\nOverall, the 1830s to the 19th century, the leaves are generally regarded as the foundation period of Western sociology. The sociology characteristics of this period are: (1) Closely related to philosophical relationship; (2) The impact of emphasized thoughts is great; (3) The purpose of establishing sociology is to maintain coordinated social relations. At this time, Kongde and British philosopher Herbert Spino were mainly represented. Kongde believes that sociology is science in studying social order and social progress [22]. The entire society and nature are based on the coordination, this is the social order; the old social order in the society has been replaced by the new social order, becoming social progress. Spencer uses social changes to sociology research. He believes that society is a body, social evolution and biological evolution to follow the same rules, with human society equivalent, and therefore, his theory is called social organic s. In 1874, Spencer prepared a book in history - \"The Study of Sociology\".\n\nAt that time, Kongde and Marx proposed that after industrialization and secularization in Europe, the development of a scientific and reasonable social system was developed, but in the same time, Marx denied the sociological exclusualism headed by Koid. At the same time as Kongde proposed sociology, Marx has formed a new materialistic view in the \"1844 Economics Philosophy\". Marx believes that the relationship between people and nature is based on labor, and he analyzes the performance of human labor in the private system of production materials. It will mark the human return and society. User-friendly, so that the economics of capitalism is criticized to the criticism of the status defined in sociology [23]. Marx's historical concept of social learning, so that sociology is essentially critical, revolutionary science, and Kongde emphasizes order, balance, and the purpose of maintaining and improving the exclusive existing institutional empirical social formation of distinctive opposition. This is also the basic reasons why Marx himself have been refused to call their social theory as \"sociology\", until the early 20th century, Lenin clearly called Marx's social theory, so that it is an important in early socialology. One of the pillars. The famous philosopher in the twentieth century also believes that Marx can be seen as \"true modern sociology of the father\" [24].\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, sociology began to flourish, attributable to French sociologist Emier Tulkhe to publish a large number of sociological research monographs, lay a solid foundation for the standardization and scientificization of sociology, and to establish sociology discipline The status makes a significant contribution. He is committed to promoting social development in his life, and will be the foundation of Physicalistism into the actual social research. In 1895, Tulkan founded the first sociology department in France, France, and published an important copy of the subsequent book \"Rules for sociological methods\" [26], establishing an independent study of other social science disciplines for sociology Objects, namely social facts. Tucan believes that all society has invisible forces, shaping people's awareness. Most intentions in humans are not generated by their own, but is formed under the outside of the outside world, influence and oppression. Social facts cannot be explained by methods of physiology, psychology or other research, but must be used The method of sociology, explanation explanation [27]. By 1896, Tulkan founded the \"L'Ann\u00e9e SociologiQue\" journal, in public, spread his research results and student research results [26]. In the \"Suicide\" published in 1897, he took the difference between Roman Catholic and new teachers' human human suicide rate, citation of sociology and psychology, philosophical perspective in analyzing social facts, and further this work is further Development Structural Functionalism Theory. For Tucan, sociology can be described as:\n\nIn the 20th century, the academic status of sociology rapidly increased, and universities across Europe have established a sociology department. The first sociology in the United Kingdom was founded in the London Institute of Political and Economics in 1904, which is also a British Sociological Magazine [29]. From 1907, the first sociological professor of the United Kingdom Lennad Tri Laissi Hopehaus began to serve as a sociological lecturer in London [30]. In 1909, German sociologist FEIN Sinnis and Max Weibo jointly established a German Sociology Association (English: German Sociologic Association), and then Weber has established Germany's first sociology department in 1919 in Munich, Germany. And the first time, the concept of anti-Validism [31]. Florian Znaczki (English: Florian Znaniecki) founded Poland's first sociology department in Pozna, Poland, Poland, Pozna, Pozna, 1920. In 1923, Frankfurt University has established a Society Institute (Institut F\u00fcr Sozialforschung) [32].\n\nAt the same time, the United States has a growing development in sociology. American sociologist William Graham Samner (William Graham Sumner) has begun to teach \"sociology\" in Yale University in 1875 [33]. In February 1890, Frank Wilson Blackmar (Frank Wilson Blackmar) established a \"Elements of Sociology\" in Kansas, Kansas, and continued to date [34]. In 1892, the representative of Chicago School-Albion Woodbury Small, founded a sociology department in the University of Chicago [35]. George He Bit Made, one of the beginning of the social psychology, and the University of Michigan met Charles Horton Cuuli and John Dewey; Mid and Dewey transferred to Chicago University in 1894. TECHNICAL [36], this makes social psychology, symbolic interactions (Symbolic Interactionism, or symbolic interaction theory) [37]. In 1895, Albi W. Mo Mo was founded the first sociological journal in the United States - American Journal of Sociology. In 1905, the American Sociological Association, ASA was established [35] and became the world's largest sociologists in the world. Talcot Passen, which is deeply affected by Tucardan and Max Weber Thoughts [38], and a life is committed to promoting the professionalization of sociology and the development of the United States. Affected by geographic and historical factors, the development of European sociology is less affected by Marxism in history, and this cultural tradition has been continuing to present, and the American sociology has more significant research methods [ 39].\n\nIn China, Shanghai Hujiang University founded the first sociology department of China in 1913 (the Department In 1952, Shanghai Hujiang Normal University) opened, including anthropology, theory and application sociology, social investigation and social issues and citizens. There are many courses, which later established in 1917 is the first university sociology experimental base in China, which is regarded as the predecessor of China 's social work service.\n\nThe first international cooperation on sociology occurred in 1893. The French government Congress audience Master Reline Walmus (English: Ren\u00e9 Worms) Journal of International Sociology and the editor of its editor, then established \"Biblioth\u00e8que SociologiQue International) \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Sociologie de Paris,\" Institute Institute \", of which the Institute of International Sociology was later combined with the 1949 International Sociology Association [40] .\n\nIn general, the growth period of academic scale in the 19th century is in the late 1930s. The development of sociology can be seen as a positive response to modern sexual problems such as industrialization, urbanization, and secularization, or the understanding of social rationalization [41]. During the initial period of sociology, the field of sociology dominated the European continent and followed the developing trajectory with the British anthropology and statistics, and put it into the 20th century. More and more sociologists are active in the so-called \"Anglosphere\", namely English-based areas. At the same time, sociology establishes its own research scope and method, the independent discipline system is basically formed, and the scope of research is increasingly specific and specialized. Few early sociologists will be limited to specific, narrow research themes, such as economics, law, psychology, philosophy, etc. are also its concerns. Since the foundation of the Sociology in the 18th century, the epistemology of sociology has been experiencing expansion and disagreement, forming hundreds of contending [42].\n\nDuring this period, an empirical route represented by Emir Turgan was formed by Max Weber, a traditional sociological research on a social survey represented by the Chicago School of Chicago. The sociological theory of Tucan is launched by social relationships and social unity as the main line, adhering to social realism and social overall governing, and advocates empirical research in the overall level of society. At the same time, he also interested in social abnormalities and social deviations. Weber is a tendency to interpret individualism, that is, an explanation of personal motivation and hidden secrets behind a particular social action and social phenomenon. He tried to verify that there is an invisible, spiritual power behind any social phenomenon.\n\nThe development period of contemporary sociology is roughly from the 1940s. This is characterized by:\n\nAfter more than a hundred years of development, although there is a lack of complete theoretical architecture and a lot of contradictions, it has become a theoretical system with a clear riche, and many of them have a distinctive practice pointing and in reality. A useful role in life. There are also many theories that are still very abstract, but they are not lacking. According to the degree of development and time order, the sociological theory is generally divided into classical sociological theory, modern sociological theory and contemporary sociological theory.\n\nClassical sociological theory is largely the theory of some famous sociologists. That is to say, the sociological theory of this period has lacks complete theoretical geography, and the theory of single sociologists can represent the characteristics of this. Therefore, when people explain the theory of this stage, most of them introduce a few sociologists' theoretical results. However, such a disadvantage is also obvious, and the theoretical outcome of a single sociologist is too reluctant to the entire theoretical system. Therefore, by the classification and summary of its characteristics, it is summarized as the following four theoretical frameworks. As a result, there is a more clear understanding of the theory of this period, and it can be connected to the genre classification with the next stage. But you have to have an in-depth understanding of each theory, or return to these sociologists.\n\n\n\nAfter the accumulation of the classical stage, sociological theory got rid of the dependence on philosophy and other social sciences, and truly embarked on the path of distinctive disciplines. At the same time that modern sociological theory has achieved significant development, the theory of classical sociology is still clear, this also shows the continuity and inheritance of both. In fact, the classification of modern and classical phases is not bounded, and there are many intersections in addition to representative characters and theoretical geography. Sociological theory in the four theoretical frameworks in classical period, there is constant rich and developed, with the difference in characteristics, these genres have been constantly differentiated, forming a new framework system.\n\nSocial Theory often uses some abstractions and even complex theory frameworks to explain and analyze social styles and macro social structures. Sociological Theory is a uncomfortable relationship with the classic discipline, which is most important sociologists as university duties. Today's social theory is considered to be sociological branches, involving multiple scientific areas such as anthropology, economics, theology, history, etc. The first social theory is almost born with sociology. The Parent of Sociology - CENE Established the First Social Theory - Social Evolution Theory. In the 19th century, the three major social theories were social evolution, social cycle theory and Marxism historical materialism. Although they are now considered to be outdated, they have new theories, like social accumulation, new evolution, modernized social biology, and post-industrialized social theory and multilateral theory. Unlike experimental natural sciences, social theorists rarely use natural scientific methods and other evidence. Instead, they use some hypothesis when they face very large social trends. However, these hypothesis take a long time to prove. This is the focus of opponents. For deconsive and postmons, they have questioned all research and methods, and many times, social theory is identified as unconpected. In fact, social practice is the only standard for inspection sociology. Sociology said in social practice, inspected in social practice and developed in social practice.\n\nIn ancient Greek society, the social transformation of the ancient Greek society has prompted the thinkers at the time to think about the problem of people and some groups, and the proposal of the golden age is such an example. At that time, the thinker was also very indignant for the darkness of the slavery, but it was hard to alternative, and the development trend of human fate was difficult to grasp, so they recruited to go back to slavery, and recovered people Dignity in society.\n\nTwo of these philosophers' social ideas can especially explain the problem. The human society in Plato's eyes is organic unity. The various components of the country have formulated the country's functions, and they are also distributed in the whole, and society is a division of labor and unbalanced unity. The sages (philosophy king) is the best candidate in the top top of the country. Because he has enough experience and knowledge, it is able to transcend the interests of the specific part and achieve the greatest well-being of the whole society. In Plato's view, private property and families are scattered and independent factors should play their role for the development of society. Aristotle is the opposite. In the \"Political Science\", although the views of human society and the country are still chaotic, the sociological thoughts are obvious, and he believes that the independent elements of each part of the society can maintain the whole society. Each independence. He pointed out that society originated from human social nature, that is, people have a collection of instincts, but complex, and unusually differentiated society are not composed of individuals, it is based on a group, so there is corresponding function The community of the property finally formed a society. [43]\n\nEnlightenment thinking about the influence of Western civilization, many social sciences were born in the emancipation and breakthrough in the ideological liberation and breakthrough, and the social development of social transformation also promoted the development of the entire enlightenment.\n\nSocial contract is the most important social idea in this period, born in the struggle with tollus and Wang Quan, the worldview of a contractual obligation and social relational structure, has become one of the direct motivations of sociology origin. The trend of \"Talent Human Rights\" is logical, thereby promoting the development of social development, is a continuous evolution from the natural state, and people formulate contracts and establish a country to protect their own talent, and this is developed to private property. The awareness of freedom, equality and enjoyment rights. At the same time, many of the many ideas have many important impact on the human society's insights.\n\nMendesan's discussion of natural geographical conditions on social, national mentality, and the historical evolution theory of this development, the contractual three-power discrete is jointly constitutes his social integrity. Voltaire's natural legislation is looking for social legislative principles that meet people's natural nature. Didero's well-off society thought, let - Jacques Roussea on the idea of \u200b\u200bsocial development stage, Hume's view of authority's influence on social development, Adam Smith's proposition in commercial society, Fogoson about citizens Social research, the study of industrial society and the use of empiricalism, etc., are an important contribution to the development of social ideas during this period. [43]\n\nSocial research mainly has two major categories: \"qualitative research\" and \"quantitative research\". Experience empirics, including questionnaires, interviews, participants observations and statistical research. Historical sociology research is a qualitative social research method. Similarly, the blend of sociology and anthropology has spawned more and more sociologists to use ethnic methods to study modern society.\n\nThe difficulties faced by different methods are to explain and understand the society based on the theoretical basis adopted by the researchers. As a functionalist, IMi Tucan likes to explain anything in a large-scale structure of society. If he is a symbolic interactive, he focuses on how people understand others. Marxists or new Marxists put what they all chemically battles. The phenomenon is just thinking about how the public has established its own meaning. When all parties face the real social problem, they often argue who is wrong, and actually combine different methods.\n\nGeneral views divide the sociology zone into two categories of macro or micro, and believe that analyzing units such as national development, belong to the former; analyzing personal spirit and household, etc. This is a fairly rigid solution. In fact, the so-called microscopic is not based on the scale of the study unit, and the microcompanies are more likely to address the basic prototype of sociology, and the interaction between different units is more observed. In fact, between the enterprises, even between the country, and can also It is considered to be an individual to study the interaction between them, with micro-mode \u4e4b\u5982, such as using symbolic interactions, phenomenon methods, etc.\n\n\nThe Internet is the interest of sociologists. Chen Dwei\n\n\nGeneral Europe and the United States pay attention to the Internet problem, which is more inclined from the median angle. It is not only a communication tool, but also to change people's interaction mode. For the 20th century, the modernity of the currency in the currency will live in the modernity; or as Turntao printing is flourishing after Europe, for European knowledge and Education or so on.\n\nThe sociologist often analyzes groups, such as social classes, social organizations, religious organizations, political organizations and commercial organizations. They studied the interaction between social groups, tracking the source and development process, analyzing the impact of group activities on various members. Sociologists care about the characteristics of social groups, interactions between groups or members, and social features (eg gender, age, class, race) to daily life. These social research results can assist educators, legislators, administrative staff, social workers, etc. to solve social problems and formulate public policies. Most sociologists have a number of expertise, such as social organization, social layering and social flow, racial relations, education, family, social psychology, city, rural, political and comparative sociology, gender role and relationship, and Learning, old age, criminal psychology and sociological application. In recent years, many sociologists have also begun to study all kinds of social inequality issues in gender, class and race. [44].\n\nToday, social research methods of human organizations, social groups, social interactions, etc. use a large number of comparison methods. The development of sociology provides additional demand for other science, which is important to study modern industrial society. In recent years, the enlightenment of anthropology has accelerated research on multivariate culture and multi-national nationals.\n\nOn the other hand, sociology develops towards micro-social structure, such as race, social class, gender and family. Because there are many criminals, family problems have produced a lot of social pressures, and they need sociology to find solutions.\n\nSociologists study social relationships through qualitative research and quantitative research to predict social changes. They hope to study through quality research, such as interviews and group discussions, and have a more in-depth understanding of social operations. Some sociologists are debating the gap between the two. For example, quantitative research describes large social phenomena, and qualitative research describes how individuals understand large social phenomena. In the early 20th century, sociologists and psychologists have made research on industrial society and contribute to anthropology. It is important to note that humanologists have studied industrial society. Today, sociology and anthropology are mainly studying different theories and methods rather than objects.\n\nSocial biology is a new science in integrated sociology and biology. Although it will receive acceptance, there are still many disputes to explain social behaviors and structures because it tries to use evolutionary and biological processes. Social biologists are often criticized by sociologists' influence of excessive relying on gene on behavior. Social biologists have a complex relationship between nature and nurture. Therefore, this social biology has a close relationship with anthropology, zoology, and evolutionary psychology. This is still unacceptable to other science. Some social biologists are like Richard Machalek asking to use sociology to study non-human society.\n\nSociology has a relationship with social psychology, the former cares about social structure, the latter cares about social behavior. Political Science, or Political Science (Politics or Politology) is a social science discipline to study political behavior, political system, and political related fields. In the West, the study in the academic field is also known as political science, political research, or only political words. \"Political Science\" means that in the academic research field, \"Political Research\" represents a wider range of research. As the name of the discipline, \"political science\" and \"political science\" are basically synonymous, but \"political science\" is more focused on empirical-based empirical research, especially quantitative studies.\n\nPolitical researchers are known as political scientists (Political Science). The academic norm of modern political science requires political scholars to maintain strict value in political affairs as research objects. However, due to the political engineers' own involvement of political processes, or their ideology and value position judgment, the reality is often more complicated. On the other hand, the politicalist is proposed to say that it is an ideal political framework for other critics, such as reporters, special interest groups, politicians, and voters analysis and choice. Although most politicalologists are generally only academic activities, some political scholars may also become a consultant for certain politicians, and even their own investment in politics. Politicalists are often working in government departments or work for some parties. They are also possible to participate in non-governmental organizations or other political movements. People who have been accepted by political education and training may also have experience and value they need for commercial enterprises and groups. The private enterprises related to the study organization, and and public relations may also hire politicalologists. Taking the United States as an example, political scientists are known as \"American ISTS\", focusing on various data such as elections, public opinion and public policies (such as social welfare reform), foreign policy, US Congress power, and Supreme Court Stand on some topics, etc.\n\nThe initial start of political research begins in ancient Greece, political science after birth. However, the predecessors of this discipline are obviously ethics, political philosophy and history, as well as other academic fields surrounded by national characteristics and functions. In almost every historical age and in every place, we can see some people specializing in research and studying politics.\n\nThe predecessor of political science even dates back to Plato and Aristotle, especially in the works of Horodod, Homer, Hessic, Xiritore and Ouri Hills et al. Later Plato began to analyze the political system of Greek City State, and they originally extracted their research and analysis of literature and history, and applied to the philosophies we call. Similarly, Aristotle has established research based on historical experience in the analysis of Plato, and has developed politics in comparative methods, and it is known as the father of political science. . \"The\" Ideal States \"and Aristotle's\" Political Science \"and Aristotle is more considered to be the founding of political science. In particular, Aristotle pointed out the correct direction of Western political research in a considerable extent [1].\n\nDuring the Roman rule, with the rise of Style, the famous historians such as Bobibibi, Top Li Wei, and Putak also recorded the Rome's Republican rising process, and the organization and history of other countries. And the politicians such as Caesar and Sichyro make us more understanding the political and war of Rome at that time. At that time, political research was mainly based on the means of learning, government governance, and the situation described by the government. Sicrosro is defined in the country (Res Publica, \"Public Life\"), designing the operational model of power refrigeration, and develops natural law thinking.\n\nWith the fading of the Roman Empire, the stage of political research is more spread. The rise of a god, especially the rise of Christianity in Western culture, producing more research spaces in political and political behavior.\n\nIn the medieval period, based on the administrative education in Europe, political science has not yet become an independent discipline, and the political issue is tended to be interpreted by religious doctrine. Therefore, the so-called political science is affiliated to theology. However, the church and the court have a quite extensive research on political research. The political study at the time was represented by the godfather's godfatherology and the philosophy of Thomas Aquarium.\n\nThe book of the \"God of God\" in the \"City\" of Augustine Hippo met the philosophical and political tradition of Christianity, redefined the domain boundaries between religion and politics. Most of this era political issue is around the church to clarify and compete with each other. Aquika has combined Greek philosophy and Christianology, and demonstrates the possibility of belief, rationality, morality and political bore.\n\nIn the Middle East and later other Islamic areas, Omar Hay Yam, \"Lugai Collection\" and the Estimi of the King of Phil Doctise have provided political points, while other Aristi Dove's Islamic scholars such as Avisena also continued to study Aristotle's analysis and empirism, and wrote many comments against Aristotle. In ancient China, the research on politics is mainly formulating the system of ritual music, military prison, and judges, and has considerable differences in modern political research [2].\n\nThe Renaissance is an important turning point for Western political research. Political science began to get rid of the theology of the theology, and people observe and explain political phenomena with rational and experience. The Italy's Niko Makiaville has established a research focus of modern political science. For political institutions and political participants to do direct observations, their works \"Monarch\", teach monarchs, and the political means of the consequences, Content and Christian doctrine conflicts are very large. The completion of \"Monarch\" is considered a milestone that is fully separated by Christianity. Later, in the enlightenment era, the expansion of the academic field has further extended the scope of political research, and it has exceeded the research on the decision-making basis.\n\nFrench political thinkor lets \u00b7 Budan systematically discusses sovereignty issues. He believes that sovereignty is the basic attribute of the country in \"Republic: Les Six Livres de la R\u00e9publiques\", is the basic attribute of the country, and is the first and inseparable. And think that in order to avoid social turmoil, it is necessary to strengthen the absolute authority of the monarch. His political theory has not yet got rid of the impact of the Middle Ages, but his sovereign theory has promoted the formation of modern nationalities and the pioneer of rational political science [2].\n\nIn the emergence of Newton, 18th Century, when the construction of modern scientific theories, political science also started scientific research in the same discipline, in Newton's world, using the results of the experimental method to sum up as knowledge, believe in nature, Responding to mathematical interpretation, etc., all of the political research has issued a new direction. At the same time, a large number of ideas, politicians have advocated the various political ideas of politicians, including the talent human rights, social contracts, decentralized balances and other learning and natural law, natural rights, sovereignty, freedom, democracy, equality, happiness, etc. Become a dominant framework for political research. When Hobbes and John Locke explore the origin of the government from different hypotenses and their legitimacy issues, Western political science began to enter logical rationalistic traditions.\n\nThe 19th century thought inherited the ideological tradition of enlightenment, including Historicalist Hegel, Kongde and Marx, as well as the Evolutionary Theory Socius, Merin, Synnis, etc. As political research is increasingly becoming a science, researchers pay more attention to the inventive and analysis of historical facts to explain political phenomenon. John Mir, Robert Michels, Max Weber et al. Is a typical representative.\n\nModern political science has originated in the United States in the 20th century. Political Science Become a formal discipline and a system in the 1880s in the 1880s, the establishment of a Political Research Institute in Columbia. The process of integrating past political research as a discipline, the history of political science also provides a wealth of research fields for political benchmarks and empirics, and every part of the discipline has some common history. But at this time, the national public law, political system, history is the most famous in Germany.\n\nAt first, political student includes explaining economic phenomena, without economics construction, but under the development of modern science, economics is made by political economics, and economics tend to study people's behavior, political research. The field is more focused on power distribution, the country, and system. After the end of the Second World War, a political branch related to sociology, economics and law is closely related to international relations becoming more important. Over time, national relations or international political research methods have also have a big difference with political science.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, David Easton, Gabriel Almond, etc., promoted the scientific research of individuals and groups in the academic field from the original system and severely discipline. . At the same time, political analysis is also facing deeper and complex parts, but also makes political science and other different disciplines more closely, especially sociology, economics, history, anthropology, and statistics. Researchers in political behavior are also increasingly dependent on scientific methods, such as quantitative research, methodology, etc., the foundation is confirmed and inferred on political trend, and summarizes the political behavior of human and groups. Explanation. In the previous generation, the political discipline is increasingly focusing on how to solve political and social issues in the reality of the reality, or to study how to solve political and social issues in the use of new methods and pathways.\n\nContemporary politicalists focused on the development and distribution of decision-making power, as well as political systems and their roles - including general government and international organizations, political behaviors, and public policies. They use many factors to assess the success of governance and specific policies, including stability, justice, material wealth, and peace. Some politicalists attempt to analyze politics to pursue further empirical scientific themes. Other politicalists analyze politics with the subject matter of the subject to propose specific policy recommendations.\n\nBased on the different opinions of politics, there are different opinions on political research objects.\n\nThe National School believes that politics itself is a national activity, so political science is the science of researching countries [3]. The political scholar headed by David Easton believes that the research object of political science is the power of power and authority and interest [4], this view is for later government research and multi-diverse development. There is a great influence [5]. Another point of impact is that political science is science in studying the political relationship between human society [6]. It is also believed that political research objects are public affairs [7]. The \"Blackville Politics Encyclopedia\" believes that the research object of political science is the government and public policy.\n\nTraditionally, political research is generally divided into two major categories of political philosophy and modern political science [2].\n\nTraditional political philosophy research political issues mainly from the perspective of philosophical thinking, from the perspective of morphine, the highest guidelines, democracy, justice, freedom, equality, etc., and corresponding political design are the focus of their research. Most politicalists generally set up an universal humanity by priori, and then set a set of high guidelines in accordance with human beings through logic deduction, and then design the corresponding political system according to this guideline.\n\nEarly institutionalists were influenced by traditional political philosophy and European mainland countries, mainly focusing on the top-down system design issues. It is believed that the system is the basic factor affecting human behavior, and the research of political institutions is mainly understood by the law and institutional constraints of power distribution and human behavior in the political system. It is mainly conducted by institutional research methods and historical comparative methods [2].\n\nThe system research method is based on political institutions, mainly research legislation, administrative and judicial and other political institutions. The main information of research is the constitution, legal, government documents, parliament agenda, etc., analyzes the political value of specific society from these materials, and The political institution or system that meets a certain purpose is designed.\n\nThe general summary of the lack of institutional research method, and the historical comparison method is enabled. The historical comparison method focuses on comparing the system between different countries, comparing different systems, and comparing the historical changes of various systems, by summarizing the universalization rules.\n\nBehavioactist against the study of the study and interpretation of political philosophy, also opposing the static description of the institutionalism and simple realistic, and believes that political research objects should be actually exist and can observe. The behavioralism pays attention to the collection and finishing of data, often uses mathematical models, simulating experiments, direct exploration, and field observation technical means for research. The main principles include accuracy, pure science, quantitative research and value removal. Its main theories include:\n\nRational choice Theory is like behavioralism, from individuals to observe and analyze political phenomena, but do not take the method of summarizing, but first assume an individual to seek its own interests, and then calculate and interpret in various situations Action that utilitarize the principle of action can take action.\n\nRational Choice Theory origins from public choice theory. Including the public selection model of James Buchanan, Anthony Downs' bureaucratic economics, Olsen's collective action theory and Rile's political alliance theory. He has gradually developed the theoretical form of alliance theory, trading theory, game theory, voting analysis, and departmental decision.\n\nStructuralism believes that there are different structures in the world affect political phenomenon. The factors of the structure include geof factors, economic strength, social norms, values, etc., environmental factors have spawned, limited political phenomena, and even make individuals unable to make independent decisions. The environment can be changed over time.\n\nIn the political academic community, there have been structuralism and rational selection, structuralists believe that the environment determines that people's choice, but the rationalists believe that people's decisions are factors that affect the environment. This makes the political phenomenon unable to avoid balance factors.\n\nSince the 1980s, the United States has raised the new institutionalism, reinstalling the research path of institutionalism, paying attention to the dynamic movement of the research system on political activities, especially the relationship between the system and behavior and the concept. As a reaction to behavioralism, the new institutionalism believes that from individuals to study the overall concept is wrong, the overall is not a simple addition of individuals. Its main genre:\n\nComparison of politics to study different governments in various ways. Take the United States and Canada as an example, it also includes research on local areas; it is to study specific states, provinces or administrative regions. Political theory includes a benchmark study on governments, ideology, regime, political movement, and political philosophy. International relations focus on the relationship between research countries and countries, and recently began to study transnational topics such as natural environment, population smuggling, trade, social exercise, production process division, and strikes against terrorism. The complex relationship between political and economic activities, responding in the field of political economics, politics Economists try to understand the relationship between economic architecture and theory and politics. The Interactive Relationship between Political Sociology and Society. The Relationship between Man and Political Behavior in Biological Political Research Institute. Political Phenomenon from Geographic Phenomena. Research Political System and Political Behavior from the Angle of Cultural Anthropology. Research on political elites, political behavior, and interaction between the two is the field of political psychology. Public administration research public policy implementation, decision, and results. Try to explain the role, bureaucratic politics, and interest groups on the political architecture, and the results of the public policy, and the results of the entity public world implementation policy. Jurisprudence, Legal Theory, also known as legal, legal science [1], is a special discipline in social sciences, researching the legalization of this particular social phenomenon and its nature and law. All order can be said to be a \"law\", such as natural law, spiritual, logistic rule or aesthetics, and law is the law of research law [2]. Although many jurists, such as Friedrich Von Logau, Julus von Kirchmann, identification of law without academic nature, but law evolution is still there to be legal Philosophy, Legal History and Legal Sciences and other three departments. In addition, it is a consideration of social sciences such as political science, economics, financial, sociology and psychology, such as research objects.\n\nThe earliest thoughts originated in the East Zhou period, such as the pipe proposition: \"The law, so the screaming; the law, the score stops [3]\". The term \"law\" is the earliest to see the \"Please study help the teaching plan\" \"to find ancient name flow, more law\". However, its meaning is different from the \"law\" of modern times [4]. In the tradition of Europe and the United States, the definition of the word Urbian in the ancient Roman jurist is: \"The Concept of Personnel and Gods, Justice and Insugorie\", Dutch jurist Gerazi believes that law is human research Follow the disciplines living in justice. During the Renaissance During the Renaissance, law studied at universities, and was one of the most active department of the academic community at the time, with medical and theological three. In the process of history, there is a custom, and then the ethics is separated by ethics, and finally there is law, but relative to the customs and morality, the law has a fixed and mandatory characteristics, which also contains the realistic power in the people's life, and try to explain the ideal world. Atcaffirmation [5].\n\nJurg (English: Jurisprudence) From the Evil of Juris Prudentia in Ancient Latin, the original interest is the legal research, knowledge or learning, where Juris is all of JUS, meaning the law; Prudentia is cautious, it is considered thoughtful, First see, careful, especially in practical acting. In the American context, law usually refer to legal philosophy, mainly four major research, primarily to seek analysis, explanation, clarifying and criticizing legal body, the second is to compare legal as well as other learning such as literature, economy, religion, society The scientific content, the third is the history, moral or cultural background of the resolution of the legal specific theme, and finally the abstraction of \"How does the law?\", \"How Judge Judges\"? \"[6].\n\nIn China, since the west weeks, there is a complete administrative system, and Zhou Li is a book, which is also a big collection of government law and private law. The summary of the physical law and procedures [7], and academic 100 pairs, the ideological freedom is free and developed, from Quan Zhong started Including business, Shen, Yin Wen, cautious, Han Fei and others, the latter is called the Fa, and it has made it in the country because of the serious way. The word law, in the pre-Qin period, known as the literacy name, since the name of the law in the Han Dynasty, to the Tang Dynasty is a mature period, there is a rival, the law, Yonghuo Law and the Odia, and \"four \"The\" Tang Lishu \"instructions mentioned:\" The alator said that the Tang law is about to give the law, thinking that it is a clear standard for the traditional Chinese tradition, also It is the explanation of the ancient characters \"\u704b\" in \"Said Wen\": \"The punishment is also. It is like water, so from the water. \u5ecc, I can't get it, so I will go.\"\n\nThere are certain rules in the behavior of people, and the ethical law of regulating human will and behaviors can distinguish between morality, customs and laws. The aforementioned law is the only law in which the following four characteristics, external care orientation, external judgment method, external purpose body, and external efficacy source [9]. That is to say, the results of the legal care behavior are not in the inner intention, as long as the behavior is in line with legal provisions, there is a subject of legal behavior, and the legislatives and arbiters have legislatives and arbiters. German famous jurists Gastav Radbruckand believes that the law has three major values: public interest, method clearness, justice, but because of the imperfect these three major values \u200b\u200bof people are not always harmonious to total Among the law [10].\n\nIn the cultural content of morality, customs, laws, countries, science, art and religion, in accordance with different schools have three major systems to discuss legal purposes, to create legal contents such as national, cultural countries, and powerful countries . The first is the end of the 18th century, Kant, Schiller, Hongbobe, and others believe that the ethical personality of freedom is the highest value, and art and science is only the tools, laws and countries that are only a protection mechanism, so law only has personalism. The essence of ethics is worthy of their own value, which is generally believed that the law is only a technological norm of rational purpose. In the power of rights, there are more national, power and their growth are the highest mission in the world. The state gives all personal moral content, all cultural achievements are national services, such as Hegel, Heinrich von. These theors of Heinrich Von Treitschke will treat the state as a whole. Humans are limbs, and the limbs are in order to overall, and the law has a personal value. Finally, it is a cultural country, such as Fphae, Sinnis, in \"Social and Community\", the highest mission of life is not in personal or collective personality, and the sum of achievements and achievements, that is Culture, the highest mission of the country is also to protect these cultural work [11].\n\nThe law's formulation is not only organized or the nationality of the country, but also from the unmetable community, but the country is not only the main source of the law, but it is also a product of the law: the country's constitutionalism The status of the jurisprises is obtained from the Constitution and related legal interpretation. In other words, the state has preset the constitution, and the Constitution is based on the country. In fact, the country and the constitution are one sided, just like organic matter and its organizations are difficult to separate [12]. The third right of the constitutional thinking is seen in the Sany Subject of the Montessan \"The Spirit of the Disciplatics\", he advocates that if the state does not want to be authorized by the rule of law, the three powers of the country cannot completely fall into the same national organ, which is the people's participation of legislation. , Administrative must legal, the judiciary must be independent. Therefore, the freedom of the constitutional country has risen, in addition to the active facilities of the people to participate in national affairs, there is also a national guarantee that they cannot violate personal freeness [13].\n\nThe police countries do not know the boundaries of state power, but they are not only to protect the people from others, but also from their ignorant hazards, and thus sacrifice the freedom of the people to protect their well-being. However, when the constitutional country silently issued a transaction in certain areas, they broke this monitoring system, which was the 1789 \"Human Rights Declaration\", in the Constitution or other laws, to declare the rights of unable violapses, such as before the law Everyone equals, personal freedom, residential and communication privacy is not infringed, belief and cultural freedom, academic and theoretical freedom, free assembly, freedom, freedom of employment, freedom of migration, etc. [14]. In the form, the Constitution is the fundamental law of the country, which is superior to ordinary laws. Other general laws must be formulated according to the Constitution, and may not contradict the constitution, otherwise it will lose its effectiveness [15].\n\nIn the classical capitalist society, the essence of economic law is to ensure that the public has the right to let go of economic activities, especially the fundamental principles of ownership, the freedom of contract and the equality of the personality, and the main content of the law require the country's largest economy. Freedom of activity, with the market automatic adjustment mechanism, the so-called \"invisible hand\", used to form a reasonable economic order of the overall market, so the intervention of economic activities is actually an extreme attitude [16]. Starting from the World War, the legislators no longer only regard the economic relationship as fair compensation between the parties, mainly based on the economic common interest, production and saving concepts, so the economic law came into being, this is a tradition The third type of legal field between the Shang Dynasty and Private Law [17], representing the consumer protection law and fair trading law in the Republic of China [18], when the country is no longer only maintained in pure private freedom, but Attempting to grasp the operational rules of the sociobial significance, turn on the \"country's hand\" to ensure the reasonable economic order of the overall market and the extraordinary economic cycle.\n\nSince the human society, there has been a crime. I have no legal concepts since I started, and I'm always rescued by the criminal behavior, and I formed a revenge system of \"teeth and the eyes of the eye\". This is the original state of the penalty. [19]. In the rule of law, the criminal law is still in the direction of authoritative thinking, with the revenge and intellectualism as thinking, making the crime clearly correspond to the criminal penalty of the should, while playing the role of maintaining legal stability, to fight against the rule Abuse of authority. As liberalism and nationalism's ideological transformation into socialist people's countries, the criminal law of social protection and education has replaced the above tradition, even in criminal policies for the prevention of criminal law, there is also a judicial trust crisis. . Today's debate is no longer priority, but the protection of the rights of criminal justice and raising the judge's discretion, and the decision between the old narrow people or the benefits of the welfare culture [20].\n\nHowever, the issue of punishment also involves the root cause of the criminal law itself. The penalty means that it is deliberate to people, and anyone wants to use penalties to understand that he is entrusted higher. Each criminal act is a product of two factors: personal character and environmental status. According to the main motivation of criminal behavior, the crime can be divided into two major categories: opportunity prisoners, and always trainees. The behavior of opportunities prisoners is caused by external irritation or incentives, and there is no long-term crime. The nature of common crimes will be crime or crime based on habits. For the latter, experience shows that many of them will live up to the efforts of educators and reward again, so the penalties can only remove them, permanently or long time to ensure social security. For the chance committee, you should express it to be clearly reprimanded to warn them. Therefore, according to the three categories of the criminals, the penalties can be divided into three categories: penalty should warn the opportunity of the opportunity to improve the personality of personality that can be changed, as well as isolate unpleakeable personal probes. Compared to general education, adolescent criminals should be mainly based on education [21].\n\nModern law refers to the science of research, but there is different views on the relationship between law and science. This is mainly related to the research of value theory. Modern Germans raised humanities and social sciences to the status of natural science, and the modern universities since Hugong University in Berlin have promoted the development of social sciences. Law is understood to be related to this background. Law is the main core content of value theory, like Danish jurist Alf Rose (English: Alf Ross) said: \"Justice ... can not be used as the rule of law, or the ultimate standard of the law, advocating a method of not just just However, it is a harmful emotional word [22]. \"In essence, the core of law is just the center of thinking, not the body's body is value, the biggest characteristic is what behaving to reflect the value in the confirmation (or Say how to confirm the value is already achieved, this argument has formed all legal department branches. Whether the verification value is achieved or how to achieve demonstration is empirical, verified, and thus scientific. In terms of value derivation, laws also have a axiom theory. Law is not scientific, and it is the easiest to ask questions, jurisprises are in the core part of the value, but this is just a jurisprudence. In the form of jurisprudence, you can despise the science, but the morphology of the jurisprudence (the solution department method) must resort to comprehensive analysis, value is only one of the elements. The legal research cannot have the conclusion of \"Objective Research, or Legal Thinking\", which can only be \"mutual subjective\" [23]. Law and affirm the law for the norm and adjustment of society.\n\nIn addition, law has been closely connected with political science, and law research law is the main content, and laws often reflect national political measures. Political type and system, often manifested by law. Political science is based on the country as the main object, and believes that the country is an legal person, legal rights obligations, and legal identification of natural persons and legal persons have the right to obligations. Therefore, law and political science are inseparable, and the relationships in the table [24].\n\nHow to classify the law according to various scholars, there is a variety of research scope and is divided into two types of general law and special law. General law research on all the concepts of law, such as legal ottery, law, law summary, special law research Learning about special legal phenomena, such as constitutional, civil law, criminal law, administrative law, commercial law, international law, etc. There are also three kinds of research content as a distinction, divided into three kinds of legal philosophy, legal history and legal science. Legal philosophy is the principle of research law, and explore the ultimate ideal of law and its use value, and the legal department of universities. A Class of Science to explore the scope of legal philosophy. Legal history, also known as the legal epithelial, mainly studying the changes in the laws and future trends, and now there are many laws and other learning, and the historical scope of legal history is now. Legal science discusses the principles of common principles, as well as the concepts, content and scope of laws, which can be divided into subjects, such as the constitution, administrative law, civil law, criminal law and other legal research [25].\n\nLegal education to teach legal knowledge, law knowledge system and cultivation of education systems and ways to develop legal profession. Modern legal education is generally divided into two basic parts of legal education and legal profession training.\n\nThe purpose of law education is cultivated in the field of law, including various legal theories and surgery. Some people divide legal education into law undergraduate education and legal postgraduate education. The former is the first academic qualifications in law (the bacterior and legal doctors), the latter is a legal education for continuing training after learning undergraduate graduation, such as Master of Law and JD. However, some people think that the law is the first academic qualification in law, but it is a graduate degree, so it is considered that the classification should be named by basic law education and advanced law education.\n\nLegal vocational training is divided into two categories:\n\nAfter the Qing Dynasty, in the early years of the Republic of China, all kinds of universities have established, including many law schools. Among them, the National Law School still has the most famous of the Beijing University of Beijing University, and the private law school is the most famous for the School of Law, East Wugu University and Chaoyang University, and \"South East\" Wu, Bei Chaoyang \".\n\nAfter the founding of the People's Republic of China, China's education community has experienced a variety of changes, and the law school is most famous with the \"Five Hospital\", which is: Beijing Political and Law School, Southwest Political Science and Law School, East China University of Political Science and Law, Central South China Law School, Beijing Department of Law, Renmin University of China, Law of Wuhan University Department of Law, Jilin University. However, the current \"five hospitals\" has become the University of Political Science and Law, and the \"four series\" has also become a law school. [26]\n\nSince the ancient Chinese students do not require legal knowledge in the Juan's Jinjin pathway, China is not very valued by legal education. And after the discovery system was canceled, under the legal reform of Shen Jiaota, it is the most ideal way to join the Beijing Square University, combined with the opportunity of law reform, and the capital of Jingshi University is a maximum of students. One of the schools read. And now, China's legal educational institutions are huge, and the number of law students in China has been in November 2008. In the thirty years of reform and opening up, the number of law students and legal teachers increased by 100. Double and 10 times. [27]\n\nCurrently, Taiwan is a representative law school:\n\nOnly research institutes have lack of law schools at the University Department:\n\nIn Taiwan, the law has a graduate from the University of the University, with the qualifications of the judiciary (judge, prosecutor), and lawyer exam. Therefore, the legal school has become one of the three-class groups, in all universities. The admission scores are often the highest in the department of the first class (including political humanistic design, business management accounting, other social sciences). In recent years, Taiwan has considering the repair of the law, and will participate in the judicial official (judge, the prosecutor) examination. The test qualification to have the legal professional research institute must be applied. If the fake, the implementation is bound to affect the Department of Legal, High School The admitted score has not been fooled.\n\nIn Hong Kong, there are legal education in the Legal College of Hong Kong University, the Legal College, Hong Kong University of China, and three universities in the Hong Kong Urban University.\n\nIn Macau, the University of Macao University of Law, two universities in Macao University of Science and Technology have legal education.\n\nThe American Law School offers a legal education of three degrees: Ph.D., a master's degree in law, and a doctor. Dr. Legal is the core of American legal education. It is both cultivating legal practitioners to cultivate legal researchers, almost all lawyers, judges, and proceedings of law are doctors graduated from law. [28] Military learning is related to many categories, mainly related to the war. In addition, military literature itself contains various learning. The military is part of politics. The war is a continuation of politics. It is a way to achieve its own goals and purpose, while the goals and purposes are often related to the interests. War is a centralized manifestation, but it is not the only manifestation. The Cold War after the Second World War (1939-1945) is a struggle against the way of avoiding warfront. In the future, the military is always important aspects in political life, and has important impact on human life in science: many technological achievements of human beings often produce in the military field and then popularize non-military fields.\n\nThe Art of War\n\nModern military includes two parts of military theory and military science and technology.\n\nAccording to the definition of the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, its subordinate disciplines are: military thinking and military history, strategic, battle learning, tactical school, military command, military, military political work, military post-diligent, military equipment Learning, military training.
